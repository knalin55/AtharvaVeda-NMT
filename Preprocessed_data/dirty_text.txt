dhrtarastra said o sanjaya what did my men and the sons of pandu do in the kuruksetra the field of righteousness where the entire warring class has assembled oro sanjaya what did the selfish intentions and the intentions born of wisdom do in the human body which is the fieldofduties the repository of the senseorgans and in which all the murderous ones passions and asceticism etc are confronting each other
sanjaya said seeing the army of the sons of pandu marshalled in the military array the prince duryodhana approached the teacher drona and spoke at that time these words
o teacher behold this mighty army of the sons of pandu marshalled in a military array by drupadas son your intelligent pupil
the heroes and mighty archers comparable in war to bhima and arjuna here are yuyudhana the king of the virata country and drupada the mighty warrior
dhrstaketu cekitana and the valourous king of kasi and kuntibhoja the coneror of many and the sibi king the best among men
and yudhamanyu the heroic and uttamaujas the valourous the son of subhadra and the sons of draupadiall are indeed mighty warriors
o best among the twiceborn however please also take note of the most distinguished amongst us who are the generals of my army and who are accepted as leaders by the heroes in the mighty army of mine i shall name them to you
your goodself and bhisma and karna krpa salya jayadratha asvatthaman and vikarna and somadattas son the valourous
and many other heroes giving up their lives for my sake fighting with various weapons all very much skilled in different warfares
thus the army guarded by bhima is unlimited or insufficient for us on the other hand the army guarded by bhisma is limited or sufficient for them the pandavas
stationed firmly in all your respective paths every one of you without exception should guard bhisma above all
generating joy in him the powerful paternal grandfather bhisma the seniormost among the kurus roared highly a lionroar and blew his conchshell
then all on a sudden the conchshells drums tabors trumpets and cowhorns were sounded that sound was tumultuous
then mounted on mighty chariot yoked with white horses madhava krsna and the son of pandu arjuna blew their heavenly conchshells
hrsikesa krsna blew the pancajanya dhananjaya arjuna blew the devadatta and the wolfbellied bhimi of the terrible deeds blew the mighty conchshell paundra
kuntis son the king yudhisthira blew the anantavijaya nakula and sahadeva blew respectively the sughosa and the manipuspaka
and the king of kasi a great archer and sikhandin a mighty warrior dhrstadyumna and the king of virata and the unconered satyaki
the pancala king a mighty archer and draupads sons who are five in number and the mightyarmed son of subhadra blew their own conchshells individually
revibrating in both the sky and the earth the tumultuous sound shattered the hearts of dhrtarastras men
o king then observing dhrtarastras men arrayed when the armed clash had virtually begun at that time pandus son the monkeybannered one arjuna raising his bow spoke these sentences
arjuna said o acyuta please halt my chariot at a centre place between the two armies so that i may scrutinize these men who are standing with desire to fight and with whom i have to fight in this great wareffort
i may scrutinize those who are ready to fight who have assled here and are eager to achieve in the battle what is dear to the evilminded son of dhrtarastra
sanjaya said o descendant of bharata dhrtarastra thus instructed by gudakesa arjuna hrsikesa halted the best chariot at a place in between the two armies in front of bhisma and drona and of all the rulers of the earth and the said o son of prtha behold these kurus assembled
sanjaya said o descendant of bharata dhrtarastra thus instructed by gudakesa arjuna hrsikesa halted the best chariot at a place in between the two armies in front of bhisma and drona and of all the rulers of the earth and the said o son of prtha behold these kurus assembled
there in both the armies the son of prtha observed his fathers and paternal grandfathers teachers maternal uncles brothers sons sons sons and comrades fathersinlaw and also friends
noticing all those kinsmen arrayed in the army the son of kunti was overpowered by unmost compassion and being despondent he uttered this
arjuna said o krsna on seeing these warmongering kinsfolks of my own arrayed in the armies my limbs fail and my mouth goes dry
shivering and horripilation arise in my body the gandiva the bow slips from my hand and my skin also burns all over
i am unable even to stand steady and my mind seems to be confused and i see adverse omens o kesava
i also do not foresee any good by killing my own kinsmen in the battle o krsna i wish niether victory nor kingdom nor the pleasures thereof
o govinda of what use in the kingdom to us of what use are the pleasures thereof and the life even
for whose sake we seek kingdom its pleasures and happiness the very same persons stand arrayed to fight giving up their life and wealth
these are our teachers fathers sons and also paternal grandfathers maternal uncles fathersinlaw sons sons wives brothers and other relatives
o slayerofmandhu krsna i do not desire to slay these meneven though they slay meeven for the sake of the kingdom of the three worldswhat to speak for the sake of the mere earth
by slaying dhrtarastras sons what joy would be to go us o janardana
nothing but sin would slay these desperadoes and take hold of us therefore we should not slay dhrtarastras sons our own relatives
how could we be happy indeed o madhava after slaying our own kinsmen
of course these dhrtarastras sons with their intellect overpowered by greed do not see the evil conseences ensuing from the ruin of the family and the sin in cheating friends
but perceiving clearly the evil conseences ensuing from the ruin of the family should we not have a sense to refrain from this sinful act of fighting the war o janardana
when a family ruins the etnernal duties of the family perish when the duties perish impiety inevitably dominates the entire family
because of the domination of impiety o krsna the women of the family become corrupt when the women become corrupt o member of the vrsniclan there arises the intermixture of castes
the intermixture leads the familyruiners and the family to nothing but the hell for their ancestors their individual souls fall down in hell being deprived of the rites of offering riceballs and water intended to them
on account of these evils of the familyruiners that cause the intermixture of castes the eternal casteduties and familyduties fall into disuse
o janardana dwelling in the hell is ite certain for men with their familyduties fallen into disuse this we have heard
alas what a great sinful act have we resolved to undertake for out of greed for the joy of kingdom we are striving to slay our own kinsfolk
it would be more beneficial for me if dhrtarastras men with weapons in their hands should slay me unresisting and unarmed
sanjaya said having said this much about the battle and letting his bow fall with arrows arjuna sat down on the back of the chariot with his mind agitated with grief
sanjaya said to him arjuna who was thus possessed by compassion whose eyes were confused and filled with tears and who was sinking in despondency madhusudana told this following sentence
the bhagavat said o arjuna at a critical moment whence did this sinful act come to you which is practised by men of ignoble low birth and which is leading to the hell and is inglorious
stoop not to unmanliness o son of kunti it does not befit you shirking off the petty weakness of heart arise o scorcher of the foes
arjuna said how shall i with arrows fight in battle against bhisma and drona both being worthy of reverence o slayer of mandhu o slayer of foes
it is good indeed even to go about begging in this world without killing the elders of great dignity but with greed for wealth i would not enjoy by killing my elders the bloodstained objects of pleasures
whether we should coner in the battle or they should coner uswe do not know this viz which of those two is better for us for having killed whom we would not wish to live at all the same persons stand before us as dhrtarastras men
with my very nature overpowered by the taint of pity and with my mind utterly confused as to the right action at the present juncture i ask you tell me definitely what would be good to me i am your pupil please teach me who am taking refuge in you
i do not clearly see what would drive out my grief the scorcher of my senseorgans even after achieving a prosperous and unrivalled kingship in this earth and also the overlordship of the gods in the heaven
sanjaya said o scorcher of foes o dhrtarastra having spoken to hrsikesa the master of senseorgans govinda krsna in this manner and having declared i will not fight gudakesa arjuna became silent
o descendant of bharata o dhrtarastra hrsikesa as if he was smiling spoke to him who was sinking in despondency in between two armies
while lamenting for those who cannot be lamented on and those who do not reire to be lamented on you do not talk like a wise man the learned do not lament for those of departed life and those of nondeparted life
never indeed at any time in the past did i not exist nor you nor these kings and never shall we all not exist hereafter
just as the boyhood youth and old age come to the embodied soul in this body in the same manner is the attaining of another body the wise man is not deluded at that
o son of kunti but the touches with the matras cause the feelings of cold and heat pleasure and pain they are of the nature of coming and going and are transient forbear them o descendent of bharata
o the best among persons that wise person becomes immortal whom these situations do not trouble and to whom the pleasure and pain are eal
birth or existence does not happen to what is nonexistent and destruction or nonexistence to what is existent the finality of these two has been seen by the seers of the reality
and know that to be destructionsless by which all this universe is pervaded no one is capable of causing destruction to this changeless one
these physical bodies that have an end and suffer the peculiar destruction are declared to belong to the eternal embodied soul which is destructionless and imcomprehensible therefore fight o descendent of bharata
whosoever views this to be the slayer and whosoever believes this to be the slain both these do not understand this does not slay nor is this slain
this is neither born nor ever dies nor having not been at one time will this come to be again this is unborn destructionless eternal and ancient and is not slain even when the body is slain
whosever realises this to be changeless destructionless unborn and immutable how can that person be slain how can he either slay any one o son of prtha
just as rejecting the tattered garments a man takes other new ones in the same way rejecting the decayed bodies the embodied self rightly proceeds to other new ones
weapons do not cut this fire does not burn this water does not make this wet and the wind does not make this dry
this is not to be cut this is not to be burnt this is not to be made wet and not to be dried too this is eternal allpervading stable immobile and eternal
this is declared to be nonevident imponderable and unchangeable therefore understanding this as such you should not lament
on the other hand if you deem this as being born constantly or as dying constantly even then o mightyarmed one you should not lament this
death is certain indeed for what is born and birth is certain for what is dead therefore you should not lament over a thing that is unavoidable
o descendant of bharata the beings have an unmanifest beginning manifest middle and certainly the unmanifest end on that account why mourning
this someone observes as a wonder similarly another speaks of this as a wonder another hears this as a wonder but even after hearing not even one understands this
o descendant of bharata this embodied one in the body of every one is for ever incapable of being slain therefore you should not lament over all beings
further considering your own duty you should not waver indeed for a ksatriya there exists no duty superior to fighting a righteous war
o son of prtha by good fortune ksatriyas desirous of happiness get a war of this type to fight which has come on its own accord and which is an open door to the heaven
on the other hand if you will not fight this righteous war then you shall incur the sin by avoiding your own duty and fame
the creatures will speak of your endless illfame and for the one who has been highly esteemed the illfame is worse than death
the mighty charioteers will think of you as having withdrawn from the battle out of fear having been highly regarded by these men you shall be viewed lightly
slandering your ability the enemies will talk of you many sayings that should not be talked of is there anything more painful than that
if you are slain you shall attain heaven or if you coner you shall enjoy the earth therefore o son of kunti stand up with resolution made in favour of fighting the battle
viewing alike pleasure and pain gain and loss victory and defeat you should get then ready for the battle thus you will not incur sin
listen how this knowledge imparted to you for your sankhya is also for the yoga endowed with which knowledge you shall cast off the bondage of action o son of prtha
here there is no loss due to transgression and there exists no contrary downward course sin even a little of this righteous thing saves one from great danger
o source of joy to the kurus the knowledge in the form of determination is just one but the knowledge thoughts of those who do not have determination has many branches and has no end
o son of prtha those whose very nature is desire whose goal is heaven who esteem only the vedic declaration of fruits who declare that there is nothing else who proclaim this flowery speech about the paths to the lordship of the objects of enjoymentthe paths that are full of different actionsand who desire action alone as a fruit of their birththey are men without insight
o son of prtha those whose very nature is desire whose goal is heaven who esteem only the vedic declaration of fruits who declare that there is nothing else who proclaim this flowery speech about the paths to the lordship of the objects of enjoymentthe paths that are full of different actionsand who desire action alone as a fruit of their birththey are men without insight
those who are very much attached to the ownership of enjoyable objects and whose minds have been carried away by that flowery speechtheir knowledge in the form of determination is not prescribed for concentration
the vedas bind by means of the three strands hence o arjuna you must be free from the three strands free from the pairs of opposites be established in this eternal being be free from the idea of acisition and preservation and be possessed of the self
what portion in a reservoir flooded with water everywhere is useful for a man in thirst that much portion alone in all the vedas is useful for an intelligent student of the vedas
let your claim lie on action alone and never on the fruits you should never be a cause for the fruits of action let not your attachment be to inaction
o dhananjaya established in the yoga perform actions abandoning attachment remaining evenminded in success and failure for the evenmindedness is said to be the yoga
o dhananjaya the inferior action stays away at a distance due to yoga of ones contact with determining faculty in the determining faculty you must seek refuge wretched are those who constitute the causes for the fruits of action
whosoever is endowed with determining facultyhe casts off both of these viz the good action and the bad action therefore strive for yoga yoga is proficiency is action
by renouncing the fruit born of action the intelligent ones endowed with determining faculty and freed from the bond of birth go to the place that is devoid of illness
when your determining faculty goes beyond the impregnable thicket of delusion at that time you will attain an attitude of futility regarding what has to be heard and what has been heard
when your determining faculty that had been earlier confused by your hearing of scriptural declaration of fruits shall stand stable in concentration at that time you shall attain the yoga
arjuna said o kesava what is the connotation of sthitaprajna a manofstabilizedintellect applied to a man fixed in concentration what would sthiradhih the fixedminded convey where would the fixedminded abide and what would be reach
the bhagavat said o son of prtha when a man casts off all desires existing in his mind and remains content in the self by the self mind then he is called a manofstabilizedintellect
he whose mind is undisturbed in the midst of sorrows who is free from desire in the midst of pleasures and from whom longing fear and wrath have totally gonehe is said to be a firmminded sage
he who has no desire in anything and who neither rejoices nor hates on getting this or that good or badhis intellect is properly stabilized
when he withdraws all his senseorgans from senseobjects just as a tortoise does all of its own limbs then he is declared to be a manofstabilizedintellect
leaving their taste behind the senseobjects retreat from the embodied who abstain from food his taste too disappears when he sees the supreme
for the turbulent senseorgans do carry away by force the mind even of this person of discerning o son of kunti
restraining them the sameorgans by mind the master of yoga would sit making me his goal for the intellect of that person is stabilized whose senseorgans are under control
in a person meditating on senseobjects attachment or them is born in succession from attachment springs passion from passion arises wrath
from wrath delusion comes to be from delusion is the loss of memory from the loss of memory is the loss of capacity to decide due to the loss of capacity to decide he perishes outright
on the contrary one who moves about consumes the senseobjects by means of his senseorgans that are freed from desire and hatred and are controlled in the selfsuch one with a disciplined self mind attains serenity of disposition
on attaining serenity there arises in succession the extinction of all miseries the capacity to decide gets stabilized soon indeed in the case of a sereneminded one
the capacity to decide is not for one who is not a master of yoga and concentration of mind is not for one who is not a master of yoga and peace is not for one who does not concentrate wherefrom could happiness come to one who has no peace
that mind which is directed to follow the wandering enjoying senseorgansthat mind carries away his knowledge just as wind does a ship on waters
therefore o mightyarmed one the intellect of that person is stabilized all of whose senseorgans starting from senseobjects have been well restrained
what is night for every other being in that a man of selfrestraint is awake wherein every other being is awake that is night for the sage who sees the truth
just as waters enter into the ocean which is being filled continuously and which is yet firmly established in the same way he into whom all objects of desire enterhe attains peace not he who longs for the objects of desire
that person who by abandoning all desires consumes objects without longing without a sense of possession and without egotismhe attains peace
o son of prtha this is the brahmanic state having attained this one never gets deluded again and even by remaining in this for a while one attains at the time of death the brahman the tranil one
arjuna said o janardana if knowledg is held to be superior to action by you then why do you engage me in action that is terrible o kesava
you appear to perplex my intellect with your speech that looks confusing hence tell me with certainty that particular thing by which i may attain the good emancipation
the bhagavat said the twofold path in this worldthe one with yoga of knowledge for men of reflection and the other with yoga of action for men of yogahas been declared to be one by me formerly o sinless one
a person attains actionlessness not just by noncommencement of actions and not just by renunciation he attains success emancipation
for no one can ever remain even for a moment as a nonperformer of action because everyone being not master of himself is forced to perform action by the strands born of the prakrti material cause
controlling organs of actions whosoever sits with his mind pondering over the sense objectsthat person is a man of deluded soul and he is called a man of deluded action
but controlling senseorgans by mind whosoever undertakes the yoga of action with the actionsenses he the detached one is superior to others o arjuna
you must perform your action which has been enjoined for action is superior to inaction and even the maintenance of your body could not be properly accomplished through inaction
the world is fettered by action which is other than the yajnartha action hence o son of kunti being freed from attachment you most properly perform yajnartha action
having created creatures formerly at the time of creation together with necessary action the lord of creatures declared by means of this you shalll propagate yourselves and let this be your wishfulfillingcow
with this you must gratify the devas and let the devas gratify you thus gratifying one another you shall attain the highest good
the devas gratified with necessary action will grant you the things sacrificed hence whosoever enjoys their gifts without offering them to these devashe is surely a thief
the righteous persons who eat the remnants objects enjoined of the actions to be performed necessarily are freed from all sins but those who cook intending their own selves are sinners and eat sin
from food arise the things that are born from the raincloud the food arises from the sacrifice the raincloud arises the sacrifices arises from action
action arises from the brahman you should know this the brhaman arises from what does not stream forth therefore the allpervading brahman is permanently based on the sacrifice
whosoever does not roll forward the wheel thus set in motion in this world he is a man of sinful life rejoicing in the senses and he lives in vain o son of prtha
but the man who simply rejoices in the self and who is satisfied in the self and who delights in the self alonethere exists no action for him to be performed
no purpose is served for him by what he has done or by what he has not done for him there is hardly any dependenc on any purpose among all beings
therefore unattached always you should perform action that is to be performed for the person performing action without attachment attains the supreme
it was by action alone that janaka and others had attained emancipation further at least having regard to hold the world the society together you should act
whatsoever a great man does other commoners do the same whatever standard he sets up the world follows that
o son of prtha for me in the three worlds there is nothing that must be done nor is there any thing unattained so far to be attained and yet i exert in action
for if i were ever not at work unwearied all men would follow my path o son of prtha
these worlds would perish if i were not to perform action and i would be a cause of confusion i would destroy these people
therefore just as the unwise persons being attached to action do o son of prtha so the wise should perform but being unattached and desiring to hold the world together
let the wise master of yoga fulfil or destroy all actions by performing them all and let him not creat any disturbance in the mind of the ingnorant persons attached to action
the actions are performed part by part by the strands of the prakrti yet the person having his self mind deluded with egoity imagines i am alone the doer
but o mightyarmed one the knower of the real nature of the divisions of the strands and of their respective divisions of work realises the strands are at their respective purposes and hence he is not attached
men completely deluded by the strands of the prakrti are attached to the actions of the strands man who know fully should not confuse them the dullard who do not know fully
renouncing all actions in me with mind that concentrates on the self being free from the act of reesting and from the sense of possession and conseently being free from mental fever you should fight
those who constantly follow this doctrine of minesuch men with faith and without finding fault in it are freed from the results of all actions
but those who finding fault do not follow this doctrine of minebe sure that these men to be highly deluded in all branches of knowledge and to be lost and brainless
even a man of knowledge acts in conformity to his own prakrti the elements go back to the prakrti and what will the restraint avail
for a man of worldly life there are likes and dislikes clearly fixed with regard to the objects of each of his sense organs these are the obstacles for him the wise would not come under the control of these
better is ones own duty though it lacks in merit than the wellperformed duty of another better is the ruin in ones own duty than the good fortune from anothers duty
arjuna said then induced by what does this person of the world commit sineventhough he does not desire itas if instigated by a force overpowering him
the bhagavat said this desire this wrath born of the rajasstrand is a swallower of festival and a mighty bestower of sins know this to be the enemy here
as the fire is concealed by smoke and a mirror by dirt and as the embryo is concealed by membrancecover so he is concealed by this foe
o son of kunti the knowledge of the wise is concealed by this eternal foe which looks like a desired one and which is the fire insatiable
it basis is said to be the senseorgans the mind and the intellect with these it deludes the embodied by concealing knowledge
therefore o best among the bharatas by controlling completely the senseorgans in the beginning itself you must avoid this sinful one destroying the knowledgeaction
different are the senseorgans from their objects they say from the senseorgans different is the mind from the mind too the intellect is different what is different from the intellect is that self
thus being conscious that is different from the intellect and steadying the self with the self kill the foe that is of the form of desire and that is hard to approach
the bhagavat said this changeless yoga i had properly taught thus to vivasvat vivasvat correctly told it ot manu and manu declared to iksvaku
thus the regal sages knew this received in regualr succession by the passage of long time this yoga has been however lost o scorcher of enemies
the selfsame ancient yoga has been taught now by me to you on the ground that you are my devotee and friend too this is the highest secret
arjuna said your birth is later while the birth of vivasvat is earlier how am then to understand that you had properly taught him this in the beginnig
the bhagavat said o arjuna many births of mine as well as of yours have passed all of them i do know but you do not o scorcher of foes
though i am unborn and the changeless self though i am the the lord of all beings yet presiding over my own nature i take birth by my own trickofillusion
for whenever there is a decay of righteousness and the rise of unrighteousness then o descendant of bharata i send forth or create that is which the self is unimportant
for the protection of the good people and for the destruction of evildoers and for the purpose of firmly establishing righteousness i take birth in every age
whosoever knows thus correctly the divine birth and action of mine he on abandoning the body does not go to rirth but goes to me o arjuna
many persons who are free from passion fear and anger are full of me take refuge in me and have become pure by the austerity of wisdomthey have come to my being
the way in which men resort to me in the same way i favour them o son of prtha all sorts of men follow the path of mine
those who are desirous of success of their actions perform sacrifices intending the deities for the success born of ritualistic actions is ick in the world of men
the fourfold castestructure has been created by me according to the division of their respective alities and actions though i am the creator of this know me as a changeless noncreator
actions do not stain me nor do i have a desire for the fruits of actions also whosoever comprehends me as such he is not bound by actions
realizing in this fashion action had been undertaken also by ancient seekers of salvation hence you too should perform by all means the more ancient action that had been performed by the ancients
even the wise are perplexed about what is action and what is nonaction i shall preperly teach you the action by knowing which you shall be freed from evil
something has got to be understand of good action also and something is to be understood of the wrong action and something is to be understood of nonaction difficult is to comprehend the way of action
he who finds nonaction in the action and action in the nonaction is an intelligent one among men and is said to be a performer or destroyer of all actions
he whose every exertion is devoid of intention for the desirable objects and whose actions are burnt up by the fire of wisdomhim the wise call a man of learning
by abandoning attachment for fruits of actions remaining ever content and depending on nothing that person even though he is engaged in action does not at all perform anything
being rid of cravings having mind and self body all controlled abandoning all sense of possession and performing exclusively bodily action he does not incur any sin
remaining contended wiht the gain brought by chance transcending the dualities pairs of opposites entertaining no jealously and remaning eal in success and in failure he does not get bound even when he acts
the action gets dissolved completely in the case of the person who undertakes it for the sake of sacrifice who is rid of attachment and is freed and who has his mind fixed in wisdom
the brahmanoblation that is to be offered ot the brahman is poured into the brahmanfire by the brahman it is nothing but the brahman that is to be attained by him whose deep contemplation is the said brahmanaction
certain other men of yoga are completely devoted to yajna connected with the devas and offer that yajna simply as a yajna into the insatiable fire of the brahman
yet others offer the senseorgans like senseofhearing and the rest into the fiires of their restrainer others offer the objects like sound and the rest into the fires of the senseorgans
some others offer all actions of their senseorgans and the actions of their lifebreath into the fire of yoga of the self control set ablaze by wisdom
these are respectively the performs of sacrifices with material objects the performers of sacrifices with penance and the performers of sacrifices with yoga likewise there are yet other ascetics with rigid vows whose sacrifices are the svadhyayaknowledge
some sages offer the prana into the apana likewise others offer the apana into the prana having controlled both the courses of the prana and apana the same sages with their desire fulfilled by the above activities and with their food restricted offer the pranas into pranas all these persons know what sacrifices are and have their sins destroyed by sacrifices
some sages offer the prana into the apana likewise others offer the apana into the prana having controlled both the courses of the prana and apana the same sages with their desire fulfilled by the above activities and with their food restricted offer the pranas into pranas all these persons know what sacrifices are and have their sins destroyed by sacrifices
the eaters of the sacrificeordained or sacrificial remnant nectar attain the eternal brahman even this world is not for a nonsacrificer how can there be the other o best of the kurus
thus sacrifices of many varieties have been elaborated in the mouth of the brahman know them all as having sprung from actions by knowing thus you shall be liberated
the sacrifice by knowledge is superior to the sacrifice by material o son of prtha scorcher of foes all actions leaving no bit meet their total end in knowledge
this you should learn from those endowed with knowledge by prostration by iniry and by service all offered to them those who are endowed with knowledge and are capable of showing the truth will give you the truth nearby
by knowing which you shall not get deluded once again in this manner o son of pandu and by which means you shall see all beings without exception in your self ie in me
even if you are the highest sinner amongst all sinners you shall cross over the ocean of all the sin just by the boat of knowledge
just as the fire well inflamed reduces the fuels to ashes so also the fire of knowledge reduces all actions to ashes
in this world there exists no purifier comparabel to knowledge one who becomes perfect in yoga finds this on his own accord in his self in course of time
he who has faith gains knowledge if he is solely intending upon it and has his senseorgans wellcontrolled having gained the knowledge he attains before long the peace supreme
but he who is ignorant and has no faith perishes with his self mind full of doubts neither this world nor the other nor happiness is for a person who is by nature is full of doubts
o dhananjaya actions do not bind him who has renounced all actions through yoga who has cut off his doubts by the sword of knowledge and who is a master of his own self
therefore thus cutting off by means of knowledgesword the doubt that has sprung from ignornace and exists in your heart practise the yoga stand up o descendant of bharata
arjuna said o krsna you commend renunciation of action and again the yoga of action which one of these two is superior to the other please tell me that for certain
the bhagavat said both renunciation and the yoga of action effect salvation but of these two the yoga of action is better than renunciation of action
that person may be considered a man of permanent renunciation who neither hates nor desires for o mightyarmed he who is free from the pairs of opposites is easily released from bondage of action
the childish and not the wise proclaim the paths of knowledge and the yoga as different he who has properly resorted to even one of these two gets the fruit of both
what state is reached by men of knowledgepath the same is reached by men of yoga subseently so whosoever sees the knowledgepath and the yoga to be one he sees correctly
o mightyarmed arjuna renunciation is certainly hard to attain excepting through yoga the sage who is the master of yoga attains the brahman before long
a master of yoga whose self mind and intellect is very pure and is fully subdued the senseorgans controlled and soul is realised to be the soul of all beingshe is not stained eventhough he is a performer of actions
a master of yoga knowing the reality would think i do not perform any action at all for he who while seeing hearing touching smelling eating going sleeping and breathing
taking rejecting receiving opening and closing the eyes bears in mind that the senseorgans are on their respective objects and
who performs actions by offering them to the brahman and giving up attachmenthe is not stained by sin just as the lotusleaf is not stained by water
having given up attachment the men of yoga perform action just with the body with the mind with intellect and also with senseorgans for attaining the self
having abandoned the attachment for the fruit of actions the master of yoga attains the highest peace but the person other than the master of yoga attached to the fruit of action is bound by his action born of desire
having renounced all actions by mind a man of selfcontrol dwells happily in his body a ninewindowed mansion neither performing nor causing others to perform actions
the lord self acires neither the state of being a creator of the world nor the actions nor the connecting with the fruits of their actions but it is the inherent nature in it that exerts
the omnimanifest soul takes upon itself neither sin nor merit born of any action but the perfect knowledge is clouded by illusion and hence the creatures are deluded
in the case of those whose illusion has been however destroyed by the selfknowledge then for them that knowledge illumines itself like the sun
those who have their intellect and self mind gone to this who have established themselves in this and have this alone as their supreme goal and who have washed off their sins by means of perfect knowledgethey reach a state from which there is no more return
the wise men look by nature eally upon a brahmana rich in learning and humility on a cow on an elephant and on a mere dog and on a dogcooker an outcaste
the brahmanknower who is disillusioned who is established in brahman and has a firm intellect would neither rejoice on meeting a friend nor get agitated on meeting a foe
he who with his self mind not attached to the external contacts finds happiness in the selfthat person with his self engaged in the yoga pervades easily suffering no loss the brahman
the enjoyments that are born of contacts with objects are indeed nothing but sources of misery and have beginning and end hence an intelligent man does not get delighted in them o son of kunti
whosoever right here before abandoning the body is capable of bearing the force sprung from desire and wrathhe is considered to be a man of yoga and a happy man
he whose pleasure delight and again light are just withino son of prtha he attains the supreme yoga himself becoming the brahman
the seers whose dirts have decayed by whom dualities have been out off whose self mind is controlled and who are delighted in the welfare of all they gain the brahman the tranil one
at all times there is the tranil brahman for the ascetics who have severed their connection with desire and anger who have controlled their mind and have realised their self
warding off the external contacts outside making the sense of sight in the middle of the two wandering ones counterbalancing both the forward and backward moving forces that travel within what acts crookedly
the sage who has controlled his senseorgans mind and intellect whose chief aim is emancipation and from whom desire fear and wrath have departedhe remains just free always
having known me as the enjoyer of the fruits of sacrifices and austerties as the great lord of all the worlds and as the friend of all beings he the man of yoga attains peace
there is no such translation for this sloka
the bhagavat said he who performs his bounden action not depending on its fruit in the man of renunciation and also the man of yoga and not he who remains simply without his fires and actions is a samnyasin or a yogin
what the learned call renunciation o son of pandu know that to be the same as the yoga for without renouncing intention for fruit one does not become a man of yoga
for a sage who is desirous of mounting upon the yoga action is said to be the cause for the same sage when he has mounted upon the yoga ietude is said to be the cause
when a person indulges himself neither in what is desired by the senses nor in the actions for it then alone being a man renouncing all intentions he is said to have mounted on the yoga
let a person lift the self by self and let him not depress the self for the self alone is the friend of the self and self alone is the foe of the self
the self is the friend of that self by which the self has been verily subdued but in the case of a person with an unsubdued self the self alone would abide in enmity like an enemy
the thinking of the person with subdued mind and hence with complete calmness remains in eilibrium in the case of others and of himself in cold and heat in pleasure and pain likewise in honour and dishonour
he whose self mind is satisfied with knowledge and with what consists of varied thoughts who remains peaklike and has completely subdued his sense organs and to whom a clod a stone and a piece of gold are the samethat man of yoga is called a master of yoga
he whose mind is eal in the case of the friend companion enemy the indifferent one the one who remains in the middle the foe the relative the righteous and also the sinfulhe excells all
let the man of yoga yoke always the self mind by remaining alone in a lonely place with his mind and self body controlled without desire and without the sense of possession
setting up in a clean place his own suitable firm seat which is predominantly of cloth skin and kusagrass and which is neither too high nor too low for him
sitting there on the seat and making the mind singlepointed let him with the activities of his mind and senses subdued practise yoga for selfpurification
holding the body the head and the neck erect and motionless remaining firm looking properly at his own nosetip and not looking at different directions
being calmminded fearless firm in the vow of celibacy controlling mind fully let the master of yoga remain fixing his mind in me and having me alone as his supreme goal
yoking his self mind incessantly in this manner my devotee with mind not attached to anything else realises peace which culminates in the nirvana and is in the form of ending in me
yoga is neither for him who eats too much nor for him who totally abstains from eating nor for him who is prone to sleep too much and nor for him who keeps awake too much
the yoga becomes a miserykiller for him whose effort for food is appropriate exertion in activities is proper and sleep and waking are proportionate
when his wellcontrolled mind gets established in nothing but the self and he is free from craving for any desired objectat that time his is called a master of yoga
just as a lamp in the windless place does not shake this simile is recalled in the case of the man of yoga with subdued mind practising the yoga in the self
where the mind wellrestrained through yogapractice remains iet again where observing by the self nothing but the self he yogi is satisfied in the self
where he realises that limitless bliss which is to be grasped by intellect and is beyond sences remaining where he does not stir out from the reality
and having attained which he does not think of any other gain as superior to that being established in which he is not shaken much by misery however powerful that may be
that he would realise to be the cause for his cessation of his contact with misery and to be the one made known by yoga with determination that is to be yoked in yoga by a person of undepressed mind or of the depressed mind
in order ot renounce completely all desires that are born of intention let a person restraining the group of senseorgans from all sides by mind alone
very slowly remain iet keeping the mind well established in the self by means of the intellect held in steadiness and lest him not think of anything object
by whatever things the shaky and unsteady mind goes astray from those things let him restrain it and bring it back to the control of the self alone
indeed the supreme bliss comes to this highly tranilminded man of yoga whose passions remain ietened who has become the brahman and who is free from sins
thus yoking the self always the man of yoga with subdued mind easily attains a complete union viz the brahman
he who has yoked the self in yoga and observes everything eally perceives the self to be abiding in all beings and all beings to be abiding in the self
he who observes me in all and observes all in mefor him i am not lost and he too is not lost for me
he who established firmly in the oneness of me experiences me immanent in all beingsthat man of yoga is never stained in whatever stage he may be
whosoever finds pleasure or pain eally in all as in the case of himselfthat person is considered to be a great man of yoga o arjuna
arjuna said this yoga of ealmindedness which has been spoken of by you o slayer of mandhu i do not find any proper foundation for it because of the unsteadiness of the mind
o krsna the mind is indeed unsteady destructive strong and obstinate to control it i believe is very difficult just as to control the wind
the bhagavat said o mightyarmed no doubt the mind is unsteady and is hard to control but it is controlled by practice and through an attitude of desirelessness o son of kunti
my belief is that attaining yoga is difficult for a man of uncontrolled self mind but it is possible to attain by proper means by a person who exerts with his subdued self
arjuna said a person who has faith and is desirous of reaching the path goal of the good but whose mind has severed from the yoga to which goal does he go having failed to attain the success in yoga o krsna
does he fallen from both get lost like a broken cloud or o mightyarmed having no support does he meet total destruction
please dispel this doubt of mine completely but for yourself o krsna no eradicator of this doubt is possible
the bhagavat said o dear partha neither in this world nor in the other is there a destruction for him certainly no performer of an auspicious act does ever come to a grievous state
having attained the worlds of performers of pious acts and having resided there for years of sasvata the fallenfromyoga is born again in the house of the pure persons who are rich
or he is born rorn nowhere other than in the family of the intelligent men of yoga for this birth is more difficult to get in the world
there in that life he gains regains that link of mentality transmitted from his former body conseently once again he strives for a full success o rejoicer of the kurus
being not a master of himself he is dragged only by that former practice its mental impression only a seeker of the knowledge of the yoga passes over what strengthens the sacred text
after that the assiduously striving man of yoga having his sins completely cleansed and being perfected through many briths reaches the supreme goal
the man of yoga is superior to the men of austerities and is considered superior even to the men of knowledge and the man of yoga is superior to the men of action therefore o arjuna you shall become a man of yoga
he who has faith and serves me with his inner self gone to me he is considered by me as the best master of yoga among all the men of yoga
the bhagavat said o son of prtha hear from me how having your mind attached to me practising yoga and taking refuge in me you shall understand me fully without any doubt
i shall teach you this knowledge in full together with action for a person who has known this there remains in this world nothing else to be known
among thousands of men perchance one makes effort for the determined knowledge among those having the determined knowledgeeven though they make effortperchance one realises me correctly
my nature is divided eightfold such as the earth the water the fire the wind the ether the mind and also the intellect and the ego
this is the lower nature of mine not different from this is my superior nature which has become the individual soul and by which this world is maintained o mighty armed arjuna you must know this
all beings are born of this womb hence keep them nearby i am the origin as well as the dissolution of the entire world
there exists nothing beyond me o dhananjaya all this is strung on me just as the groups of pearls on a string
o son of kunti i am the taste in waters the light in the moon and the sun the best hymn om in the entire vedas the sound that exists in the ether or the mystic hymnal sound in the entire vedasa sound that is in the ether and the manly vigour in men
i am the pure smell in the earth i am also the brilliance in the sun i am the life in al beings and austerity in the ascetics
o son of prtha know me as the eternal seed of all beings i am the intellect of the intellectuals and the brillinace of the brilliant
of the strong i am the strength that is free from desire and attachment o best of the bharatas in all beings i am the desire which is not opposed to attributes
whatever beings are there in the universewhether they are of the sattva or of rajas or of tamas strands be sure that they are from me i am not in them but they are in me
being duluded by these three beings of the strands this entire world does not recognise me who am eternal and transcending these strands
this is my play daivi trickofillusion composed of the strands and is hard to cross over those who resort to me alonethey cross over the trickofillusion
the deluded evildoers the vilest men who are robbed of knowledge by the trickofillusion and have taken refuge in the demoniac naturethey do not resort to me
men of good action who worship me always are of four types the afflicted the seeker of knowledge the seeker of wealth and the man of wisdom o best among the bharatas
of them the man of wisdom being always attached to me with singlepointed devotion excels others for i am dear to the man of wisdom above all personal gains and he is dear to me
all these are noble persons indeed but the man of wisdom is considered as the very soul of mine for with his self mind that has mastered the yoga he has resorted to nothing but me as his most supreme goal
at the end of many births one attains me with the conviction that all is vasudeva that noble soul is very difficult to get
being robbed of their wisdom by innumerable desires and being controlled by their own nature persons take refuge in other deities by following one or the other religious regulations
whatever may be the form of the deity a devoteewhosoever he may bedesires to worship with faith i assume that form which is firm and is according to his faith
endowed with that faith he seeks to worship that deity and therefrom receives his desired objects that are ordained by none but me
but that fruit of those men of poor intellect is finite those who perform sacrifices aiming at the gods go to gods and my devotees go to me
the men of poor intellect are not conscious of the higher changeless and supreme nature of mine and hence they regard me the unmanifest to be a manifest one
being surrounded by the trickofyogaillusion i am not clear to all and hence this deluded world of perceivers does not recognise me the unborn and the undying
o arjuna i know the beings that are gone off that are present and are yet to be born but no one knows me
o descendant of bharata o scorcher of foes at the time of creation all beings get delusion because of the illusion of pairs of opposites arising from desire and hatred
but those men of virtuous deeds whose sin has come to an endthey being free from the delusion of pairs of opposites worship me with firm resolve
those who relying on me strive to achieve freedom from old age and deaththey realise all to be the brahman and realise all the actions governing the self
those who realise me as one identical with what governs the beings deities and with what governs the sacrificesthey even at the moment of their journey experience me with their mastering the yoga
arjuna said what is that brahman what is termed the lordoftheself adhyatma what is action o the bestofpersons what is stated to be the lordof materialthings adhibhuta what is called lordofdivinities adhidaiva
who is lordofsacrifices adhiyajna and how who in this body o slayer of madhu how are you to be realised by the selfcontrolled ones at the time of their journey ie death also
the bhagavat said the immutable absolute is the brahman its intrinsic nature is called the lord of the self the emitting activity that causes the birth of both the animate and the inanimate is named action
the changing nature is the lord of the material beings the person alone is the lord of the divinites i am alone the lord of sacrifices and i the best of the embodied souls dwell in this body
whosoever at the time of death also remembering me alone sets forth by abandoning his body behind he attains my being there is no doubt about it
and also remembering whatever being a person leaves his body at the end of his life that being alone he attains o son of kunti because he has been constantly thinking about that being
therefore at all times keep me in the mind and also fight then having your mind and intellect dedicated to me you will doubtlessly attain me alone
he who is engaged in the afterreflection who meditates on the supreme divine soul with his mind remaining fixed in the practiceyoga and hence passing over no other object that person attains that supreme o son of prtha
he who meditates continuously on the ancient seer the ruler the subtler than the subtle the supporter of all the unimaginableformed the suncoloured and that which is beyond the darkness
that person endowed with a steady mind with devotion and also with the yogapower reaches at the time of journey that supreme divine soul by fixing properly the lifebreath in between his eye brows
that unchanging one which the vedaknowers speak of which the passionfree ascetics enter into seeking which they practise celibacy or spiritual life that goal together with means to reach it i shall tell you
properly controlling all the gates in the body well restraining the mind in the heat fixing ones own prana in the head taking resort to the firmness of the yoga
reciting the singlesyllabled om the very brahman meditating on me whosoever travels well casting away his bodysurely he attains my state
and whosoever constantly bears me in mind never attached to any other objectfor this yogin ever devout i am easy to attain o son of prtha
having attained me the men of great soul who have achieved the supreme perfection do not get the transient rirth a storehouse of all troubles
till the brahman is attained people do return from each and every world o arjuna but there is no rirth for one who has attained me o son of kunti
those who know the day of brahma as compassing one thousand yugas worldages and night also as compassing one thousand yugasthose men know the day and night of brahma
while the day approaches all manifestations issue forth from the unmanifest and while the night approaches they dissolve into the same that bears the name the unmanifest
being born and born again the self same multitude of beings gets dissolved while the night approaches and issues forth willynilly while the day approaches o son of prtha
but there exists another being which is beyond this and it is both manifest and unmanifest and is etnernal it is this being that does not perish while all the other beings perish
the scriptures speak of this as unmanifest and changeless and declare this is to be the highest goal having attained which people do not return this is my highest abode
the supreme soul o son of prtha is attainable through devotion that admits no other things having attained which soul the men of yoga do not get birth again within which exist the beings and in which everything is well established o arjuna
departing at what times the yogins attain the nonreturn or the return onlythose times i shall declare to you o chief of the bharatas
the northern course of the sun consisting of six months is fire light day and bright one departing in it the brahmanknowing men attain the brahman
the southern course of the sun consisting of six months is smoke night and also dark departing in it the yogin attains the moons light and he returns
for these two bright and dark courses are considered to be perpetual for the world one attains the nonreturn by the first of these and one returns back by the other one
o son of prtha not a single yogin knowing these two courses gets deluded therefore o arjuna be practising yoga connected with all times
having understood all this the yogin goes beyond whatever fruit of merit is ordained in the scriptures in case the vedas are recited the sacrifices performed the austerities observed and also gifts donated and he goes to the supreme primeval abode
the bhagavat said to you who is entertaining no displeasure i shall clearly declare also this most secret knowledge together with action by knowing which you shall be free from evil
this shines among the sciences this is the secret of monarchs it is a supreme purifier it is comprehensible by immediate perception is righteous easy to do and imperishable
o scorcher of foes having no faith in this dharma persons do not attain me and remain eternally in the circuit of mundane existence wrought with death
this entire universe is pervaded by me having the unmanifest form aspect all beings exist in me and i do not exist in them
yet the beings do not exist in me look at the sovereign yoga of mine my self is the sustainer of the beings does not exist in beings and cuases beings to be born
just as the mighty wind exists in the ether always moving in it everywhere in the same manner all beings exist in me be sure of it
o son of kunti all beings pass into the nature of mine at the end of the kalpa the age of universe i send them forth again at the beginning of the next kalpa
taking hold of my own nature i send forth again and again this entire host of beings which is powerless under the control of my nature
o dhananjaya these acts do not bind me remaining as if unconcerned and unattached in these actions
o son of kunti on account of me who remain only as an observer and as prime cause the nature of mine gives birth to both the moving and unmoving hence this world moves in a circle
being unaware of the immutable highest absolute supreme nature of mine the deluded ones disregard me dwelling in the human body
they are of futile aspirations futile actions futile knowledge and wrong intellect and they take recourse only to the delusive nature that is demoniac and also devilish
o son of prtha the greatsouledmen however taking hold of the divine nature and having nothing else in their mind adore me by viewing me as the imperishable prime cuase of beings
ever speaking of my glory striving with firm resolve paying homage to me and being permanently endowed with devotion they worship me
of them some worship me by knowledgesacrifice and others by offering sacrifices thus they worship me the universallyfaced either as one or as many
i am determination i am sacrifice i am svadha i am the juice of the herb i am the vedic hymn i am alone the clarified butter also i am the sacrificial fire and i am the act of offering
i am the father the mother the sustainer and the paternalgrandsire of this world i am the sacred object of knowledge the syullable om the rk the saman and the yajus too
i am the method the nourisher the lord the witness the abode the refuge the goodhearted friend the origin the dissolution the sustenance the repository and the imperishable seed of the world
i give heat i hold back and also end forth rains i am immortality and also death the real and also the unreal o arjuna
the masters of the three vedas the somadrinkers purified of their sins aspire for the heavengoal by offering sacrifices to me they attain the meritorious world of the lord of gods and taste in the heaven the heavenly pleasures of the gods
having enjoyed that vast world of heaven they when their merit is exhausted enter the world of the mortals thus the persons who long for pleasure and continuously take refuge in the code of conduct prescribed by the three vedas attain the state of going and coming
those men who having nothing else as their goal worship me everywhere and are thinking of me alone to them who are constantly and fully attached to me i bear acisition and the security of acisition
o son of kunti even those who are the devotees of other gods and worship them with faith worship me alone but following noninjunction
because i am the enjoyer as well as the lord of all sacrifices but they do not recognise me correctly and hence they move away from me
the votaries of the gods attain the gods the votaries of the manes attain the manes performers of sacrifices for the goblins attain the goblins also the performers of scrifices for me attain me
whosoever with devotion offers me a leaf a flower a fruit or a little water i taste that offered with devotion by one with wellcontrolled self mind
whatever you do whatever you eat whatever oblation you offer whatever gift you make and whatever austerity you perform o son of kunti do that as an offering to me
thus you shall be freed from the good and evi results which are the actionbonds having your innate nature immersed in the yoga of renunciation and thus being fully liberated you shall attain me
i am the same in all beings to me none is hateful and none is dear but whosoever worship me with devotion they are in me and i am in them
even if an incorrigible evildoer worships me not resorting to anything else as his goal he should be deemed to be righteous for he has undertaken his task properly
quickly he becomes righteoussouled minded and attains peace permanently o son of kunti i swear that my devotee gets never lost
o son of prtha even those who are of sinful birth besides women men of working class and the members of the fourth casteeven they having taken refuge in me attain the highest goal
certainly it should be so in the case of the pious men of the priestly class and of the devoted royal seers having come to ie being born in this transient and joyless world you should be devoted to me
have your mind fixed on me be my devotee offer scrifice to me and pay homage to me thus fixing your self internal organ and having me as your supreme goal you shall certainly attain me
the bhagavat said o mightyarmed arjuna yet again listen to my best message which with good intention i shall declare to you who are dear to me
neither the hosts of gods nor the great seers know my origin for i am the first in every respect among the gods and great seers
whosoever knows me as the unborn and beginningless absolute lord of the universe that person not deluded among the mortals is delivered from all sins
intellect knowledge steadiness patience truth control over senseorgans tranility of mind pleasure pain birth death fear and courage
also noninjury eanimity contentment austerity charity repute and illrepute all these diverse dispositions of beings emanate from none but me
the ancient seven greatseers and also the four manus of whom these creatures in this world are offspringsthey have been born as my mental dispositions
he who knows correctly this extensively manifesting power and the yogic power of minehe is endowed with the unwavering yoga there is no doubt about it
he is the source of all and from him all comes forth thus viewing the wise men revere me with devotion
having their mind fixed on me their life gone into me enlightening each other and constantly talking of me they are pleased and are delighted
to these persons who are thus mingling with me and revere me with love i grant that knowledgeyoga by means of which they reach me
out of compassion only towards these men i who remain as their very self destroy with teh shining light of wisdom their darkness born of ignorance
arjuna said you are the supreme brahman supreme abode supreme purifier all the seers and also the divine seer narada asita devala vyasa describe you as the eternal divine soul the unborn allmanifesting firstgod you too say so to me
arjuna said you are the supreme brahman supreme abode supreme purifier all the seers and also the divine seer narada asita devala vyasa describe you as the eternal divine soul the unborn allmanifesting firstgod you too say so to me
what you tell me i take all to be true o kesava for o bhagavat neither the gods nor the great seers know your manifestation
only yourself know yourself by yourself o supreme purusa creator of all beings lord of beings god of gods lord of the universe
you are alone capable of fully declaring the auspicious manifesting powers of yours by which manifesting power you remain pervading these worlds
o mighty yogin how should i know you meditating on you in what several entities o bhagavat are you to be contemplated upon by me
in detail please expound once again your own yogic power and the manifesting power o janardana i dont feel contended in hearing your nectarlike exposition
the bhagavat said yes o the best among the kurus i shall expound to you only the chief auspicious manifesting powers of mine for there would be no end to my details
o coneror of sleep i am the soul residing in the heart of all beings i am the beginning and the middle and also the very end of beings

of the horses you should know me to be the nectarborn uccaihsravas indras horse of the best elephants the airavata indras elephant and of the men their king
of the weapons i am the vajra of indra of the cows i am the wishfullfilling cow of the heaven of the progenitors i am kandarpa the godoflove of the serpents i am vasuki
of the snakes i am ananta of the waterbeings waterdeities i am varuna of the manes i am aryaman of the controllers i am yama the deathgod
no such translation is available for this sloka
of the progenies of diti the demons i am prahlada of the measuring ones i am the shark of rivers i am the daughter of jahnu the ganga
of the creations i am the beginning the end and also the middle o arjuna of the sciences i am the science of the self of arguers i am the argument
of the syllables i am a of the compounds the dvandva none but me is the immortal time i am the dispenser of fruits actions facing on all sides

i am the punishment at the hands of the punishers i am the political wisdom of those who seek victory i am also silence of the secret ones i am the knowledge of the knowers
further o arjuna i am that which is the seed of all beings there is no being whether moving or nonmoving that could exist without me
o scorcher of foes there is no end to my extraordinary manifesting power the above details of my manifesting power have been declared by me only by way of examples
whatsoever being exists with the manifesting power and with beauty and vigour be sure that it is born only of a bit of my illuminant
or o arjuna why this detailed statement i remain pervading this entire universe with a single fraction of myself
arjuna said my delusion has completely gone thanks to the great and mysterious discourse which is termed as a science governing the soul and which you have delivered by way of favouring me
the origin and the dissolution of beings have been listened to in detail by me from you o lotuseyed one and also to your inexhaustible greatness
as you describe yourself as the supreme lord of all it must be so hence o supreme self i desire to perceive your lordly form
o master if you think that it is possible for me to see that form then o lord of the yogins please show me your immortal self
the bhagavat said behold o son of prtha my divine forms in hundreds and in thousands and of varied nature and of varied colours and varied shapes
behold the adityas the vasus the rudras the twin asvins and the maruts o son of pandu behold also many wonders that had never been seen before
now behold the entire universe including the moving and the unmoving and whatsoever else you desire to seeall established in one here in my body o gudakesa arjuna
but you cannot see me simply with this eye of yours hence i give you the divine eye now behold the lordly form of mine
sanjaya said o king having thus stated hari krsna the mighty lord of the yogins showed to the son of prtha his own supreme lordly form
that has many mouths and eyes many wondrous sights many heavenly ornaments and many heavenly weapons held ready
that wears heavenly garlands and garments has the unguent of heavenly sandal paste it is all wonderful shining or godly infinite and it has faces in all directions
if the splendour of a thousand suns were to burst forth at once in the sky would that be eal to the splendour of that mighty self
at that time the son of pandu beheld there in the body of the godofgods the entire universe united in one and yet divided into many groups
then possessed by amazement and with his bodily hair thrilled dhananjaya arjuna with his head bowed to the god and with folded palms spoke to him
arjuna said o god in your body i behold all gods and also hosts of different kinds of beingsthe lord brahma seated on the lotusseat and all the seers and all the glowing serpents
i behold you of many arms bellies mouths and eyes and of infinite forms on all sides of you i find neither the end nor the centre nor the beginnng too o lord of the universe o universalformed one
i behold you as having crowns clubs and discs as a mass of radiance shining on all sides hard to look at and on each side blazing like burning fire and the sun and as an immeasurable one
you are the imperishable the supreme being to be known you are the ultimate place of rest for this universe you are changeless and the guardian of the pious act of the satvatas you are the everlasting soul i believe
i observe you having to beginning no middle and no end having infinite creative power and infinite arms as havig the moon and the sun for your eyes and the blazing fire for your mouth and as acorching this universe with your rediance
this space in between the heaven and the earth as well as all the directions are pervaded singly by you seeing this wondrous form of yours as such o exalted soul the triple world is very much frightened
these hosts of gods enter into you some frightened ones recite hymns with folded palms simply crying hail the hosts of great seers praise you with the excellent praising hymns
the rudras the adityas the vasus the sadhyas the visvas visvadevas the twin asvins and the maruts and the steamdrinkers manes and the hosts of the gandharvas the yoksas the demons and the perfected ones all gaze on you and are ite amazed
o mightyarmed one having seen your mighty form that has many faces and eyes many arms thighs and feet and many bellies and is terrible with many tusks the worlds are frightened and so also myself
as i observe you with form touching the sky blazing having many colours mouths wide open eyes blazing and large i am terrified in my inner soul mind and i do not get courage and peace o visnu
by merely seeing your faces that are frightening with tusks and are looking like the fire of destruction i do not know the arters and get no peace have mercy o lord of gods o abode of the universe
all these sons of dhrtarastra along with the entire hosts of kings this bhisma this drona and this son of the charioteer karna together with the chief warriors of ours too
they enter hastening into your terrible mouths frightening with tusks some of them sticking in between your teeth are clearly visible with their heads powered
just as many waterrapids of the rivers race heading towards the ocean alone in the same manner these heroes of the world of men do enter into your mouths flaming all around
just as with full speed the moths enter into the flaming fire for their own destruction in the same manner the worlds also do enter for their own destruction with full speed into the mouths of yours
devouring on all sides with your blazing mouths the entire worlds you are licking up your terrible rays scroch the entire universe filling it with their radiance o visnu
please tell me who you are with a terrible form o the best of gods salutation to you please be merciful i am desirious of knowing you the primal one in detail for i do not clearly comprehend your behaviour
the bhagavat said i am the time the worlddestroyer engaged here in withdrawing the worlds that are overgrown even without you your fighting all the warriors standing in the rival armies would cease to be
therefore stand up win glory and vanishing foes enjoy the rich kingdom these foes have already been killed by myself hence be a mere token cause in their destruction o ambidextrous archer
slay drona and bhisma and jayadratha and karna as well as the other heroes of the worldall already slain by me do not get distressed fight you shall vanish enemies in the battle
sanjaya said on hearing this speach of kesava the crownedprince arjuna had his palms folded and trembling he protstrated himself to krsna and stammering and being very much afraid and bowing down he spoke to him again
arjuna said o lord of senseorgans krsna it is appropriate that the universe rejoices and feels exceedingly delighted by the high glory of yours that in fear the demons fly on all directions and that the hosts of the perfected ones bow down to you
o mighty one why should they not bow down to you the primal creater who are greater than even brahma personal god o endless one o lord of gods o abode of the universe you are unalterable existent nonexistent and also that which is beyond both
you are the primal god you are the ancient soul you are the transcending place of rest for this universe you are the knower and the knowable you are the highest abode and the universe with its infinite forms is pervaded by you
you are vayu yama agni varuna the moon prajapati and the greatpaternalgrandfather salutation and salutation thousand times to you and again also more salutation and salutation to you
salutation to you in the front and behind salutation to you just on all sides o one who are all you are of infinite might and of immeasurable powers and you pervade all and hence you are all
taking you for a mere companion not knowing this greatness of yours and out of my carelessness or through even affection whatever i have importunately called you as o krsna o yadava o comrade and
whatever disrespect was shown by me to you to make fun of you in the course of play or while on the bed or on the seat or at meals either alone or in the presence of repectable persons for that i beg pardon of you the unconceivable one o acyuta
you are the father of the world of the moving and unmoving you are the great preceptor of this universe in the triad of worlds there is no one eal to youhow can there be anyone else superior having greatness not comprehended
hence paying homage and prostrating may body i solicit grace of you the lord praisworthy o god be pleased to bear with me just as a beloved father with his beloved son and just as a dear friend with his dear friend
i am thrilled by seeing what has not been seen earlier and my mind is very much distressed with fear show me the same usual form of yours kindly be appeased o god lord of gods o abode of the worlds
i desire to see you in the same manner wearing crown holding the club and the discuss in hand please be with the same form having four hands o thousandarmed one o universal form
the bhagavat said being gracious towards you i have shown you o arjuna this supreme form as a result of your concentration on the self this form of mine full of splendour universal unending and primal has been never seen before by anybody other than yourself
not by the knowledge of the vedas and sacrifices nor by making gifts nor by the rituals nor by severe austerities can i be seen in this form in the world of men by anybody other than yourself o the great hero of the kurus
let there be no distress and no bewilderment in you by seeing this terrific and violent form of mine being free from fear cheerful at heart behold again this form of mine which is the same as before
having said to arjuna as above vasudeva revealed his own tiny form assuming his gentle body once again the mighty soul krsna consoled the frightened arjuna
arjuna said on seeing this gentle human form of yours o janardana now i have regained my nature and have now collected my thinking faculty
the bhagavat said this form of mine which you have just observed is extremely difficult to observe even gods are always curious of observing this form
neither by reciting vedas no by obseving austerity nor by offering gifts nor by performing sacrifice can i be observed in this manner as you have see me now
but through an undeviating devotion it is possible to know and to observe and also to enter into me as such o arjuna o scorcher of foes
he who performs actions for attaining me who regards me as his supreme goal who is devoted to me who is free from attachment and who is free from hatred towards all beingshe attains me o son of pandu
arjuna said those devotees who being constantly attached to you worship you thus and also those who worship the motionless unmanifestof these who who are the best knowers of yoga
the bhagavat said those who causing their mind to enter well into me and being permanently attached to me and endowed with an extraordinary faith worship me they are considered by me to be the best among the masters of yoga
those who contemplate on the unmanifest which is motionless undefinable allpervading unthinkable peaklike unmoving and fixed
who by restraining properly the group of senseorgans have eanimity at all stages and find pleasure in the welfare of all beings they attain nothing but me
but the trouble is much more for them who have their mind fixed on the unmanifest for the unmanifestgoal is attained with difficulty by men bearing body
on the other hand those who having renounced all their actions in me have me alone their goal and revere me meditating on me by that yoga alone which admits no other element but me in it
of them having their mind completely entered in me i become before long a redeemer from the ocean of the deathcycle o son of prtha
hence fix your mind on nothing but me cuase your taught to settle in me thus resorting to the best yoga you will dwell in me alone
in case you are not able to cause your mind to enter completley into me then o dhananjaya seek to attain me by the practiceyoga
if you are incapable of doing a steady practice then have your chief aim of performing actions for me even by performing actions for me you shall attain success
now if you are not capable of doing this too then taking resort to my yoga renounce the fruit of all action with your self mind subdued
for knowledge is superior to practice because of knowledge meditation becomes preeminent from meditation issues the renunciation of fruits of actions and to renunciation peace remains next
he who is not a hater but only a compassionate friend of every being who is free from the sense of mine  and the sense of i who is even minded in pain and pleasure and is endowed with forbearance
who remains wellcontent and is a man of yoga at all times who is selfcontrolled and is firmly resolute and who has offered to me his mind and intellectthat devotee of mine is dear to me
he on account of whom the world does not get agitated who too does not feel agitated on account of the world who is free from joy and impatience fear and anxietyhe is dear to me
he who does not expect anything who is pure dexterous unconcerned untroubled and who has renonced all his undertakings all aroundthat devotee of mine is dear to me
he who neither delights no hates nor grieves nor craves who has renounced both the good and the bad results of actions and is full of devotion to mehe is dear to me
he who feels alike to the foe and to the friend and also to honour and to dishonour who feels alike to cold and to heat to pleasure and to pain who is totally free from attachment
to whom blame and praise are eal who is silent does not overspeak and is well content with one thing or other that comes to him who has no fixed thought in the mundane life who is yet steadyminded in spiritual practice and is full of devotionthat man is dear to me
those who resort as instructed above to this duty conducive to immortality who have faith in it and have me alone their goal those devotees are exceedingly dear to me
no such translation is available for this sloka
the bhagavat said o son of kunti this physical hody is called field and decayercumprotector he who sensitiezes it his knowers call him properly as fieldsensitizer
o descendant of bharata you should know me to be also the fieldsensitizer in the fields of all the knowledge of the field and the fieldsensitizerthat knowledge is in fact the understanding of me
what that field is and of what nature it is why it modifies whence and what and who he the fieldsensitizer is and of what nature he is listen to all that from me collectively
this has been sung many times by sages and also has been clearly decided in the various vedas in different contexts by means of their words that are suggestive of the brahman ie in the upanisads and are full of reasoning
the five great elements the egotism the intellect the unmanifest and also the ten organs and the one organ and the five objects of the senseorgans
the desire the hatred the pleasure the pain the aggregate the sensibility and the feeling of satisfaction or selfnd this together with modification is what is collectively called the field together with modification
absence of pride absence of hypocricy harmlessness patience uprightness service to the preceptor purity of mind and body steadfastness selfcontrol
absence of desire for senseobjects and also absence of egotism pondering over the evils of birth death old age sickness and sorrow
nonattachment detachment towards ones children wives houses and the like and a constant ealmindedness on the occurrence of the desirable and the undesirable things
and an unfailing devotion towards me with the yoga of nondifference resorting to solitary place distaste for a crowd of people
constancy in the selfknowledge and viewing things of knowing the realityall this is declared to be conducive to or manifesting true knowledge and what is opposed to this is conducive to or manifesting wrong knowledge
i shall describe that which is to be known by knowing which one attains freedom from death beginningless is the supreme brahman it is said to be neither existent nor nonexistent
it has hands and feet of all has eyes heads and faces of all has ears of all in the world it remains enveloping all
it causes all the sensealities to shine yet it is without any senseorgan it is unattached yet allsupporting it is free from the strands yet enjoys the strands
it is without and within every being and is unmoving and yet moving too due to its subtle nature it is incomprehensible it exists far away yet near it is
it remains undistinguished common in the distinguished beings and appears as if distinguished it is to be known as the supporter of beings and also as their swallower and orginator
this is the light even of all the lights and is stated to be beyond darkness it is to be known by the above knowledge it is to be attained only by knowledge and it distinctly remains in the heart of all
this field as well as the knowledge and what is to be known all are mentioned collectively clearly understanding this my devotee becomes worthy of my state
both the material cause and the soul too are beginningless you should know this you should also know that the modifications and strands are born of the material cause
in creating the process of causeandeffect the material cause is said to be the basis and in experiencing pleasure and pain the soul is said to be the basis
for the soul seated on the material cause enjoys the strands born of the material cause his attachment to the strands is the cause for his births in the good and evil wombs
the supreme soul in this corporeal body is called the spectator the assentor the supporter the experiencer the mighty lord and also the supreme self
he who knows in this manner the soul and the material cause together with strandshe is not born again even though he behaves in different ways
however by means of meditation certain persons yogis perceive the self as the self in the self the heart etc others by the knowledgeyoga and others by the actionyoga
but others who have no knowledge of this nature listen from others and practise reflection accordingly they too being devoted to what they have heard do cross over death
whatever living being is born stationary or moving you should know that all this has a close connection with the field and the fieldsensitizer o the best of the bharatas
whosoever perceives the supreme lord as abiding and as nonperishing in all beings alike while they perish he perceives properly
whosoever perceiving the lord as abiding in all alike does not harm the self by the selfhe attains on that account the supreme goal
whosoever views all actions as being performed or all objects as being created indeed by the material cause itself and at the same time views his own self as nonperformer or noncreator he veiws properly
when he perceives the mutual difference of beings as abiding in one and its expansion from that alone at that time he becomes the brahman
because this is beginningless and because this has no alities this supreme self is changeless and it neither acts nor gets stained by actions eventhough it dwells in the body o son of kunti
just as the allpervading ether is not stained because of its subtleness in the same fashion the self abiding in the body everywhere is not stained
just as a single sun illumines this entire world so also the lordofthefield illumines the entire field o descendant of bharata
those who thus understand with the knowledgeeye the inner soul of the field and the fieldsensitizer and also the deliverance from the material cause of the elementsthey attain the supreme
the bhagavat said further once again i shall explain the supreme knowledge the best among the knowledges by knowing which all the seers have gone from here to the supreme success
holding on to this knowledge they have attained the state of having attributes common with me and they are neither born even at the time of creation of the world nor do they come to grief at the time of dissolution of it
the mighty brahman is a womb for me and in that i lay seed therefrom is the birth of all beings o descendant of bharata
o son of kunti whatever manifestations spring up in all the wombs of them the mighty brahman is the womb and i am the father laying the seed
the strands viz the sattva the rajas and the tamas born from the prime cause the said mother bind the changeless embodied soul to the body o mightyarmed one
among them the strands the sattvabecause it is dirtlessis illuminating and healthy and it binds the embodied by attachment to happiness and also by attachment to knowledge o sinless one
you should know that the rajas is of the nature of desire and is a source of cravingattachment and it binds the embodied by the attachment to action o son of kunti
but you should also know that the tamas is born of ignorance and is a deluder of all the embodied it binds them by negligence laziness and sleep o descendant of bharata
o descendant of bharata the sattva fully dominates the embodied in the field of happiness the rajas in action but the tamas also totally dominates in the field of negligence by veiling knowledge
o descendant of bharata the sattva increases by overpowering the rajas and the tamas the rajas increases by overpowering the sattva and the tamas and the tamas does likewise by overpowering the sattva and the rajas
when the knowledgelight arises in all the gates in this body then one should also know that the sattva has increased predominantly
greed exertion undertaking of actions unrest and cravingthese are born when the rajas increases predominantly o chief of the bharatas
absence of mental illumination nonexcertion negligence and mere delusionthese are born when the tamas is on the increase predominantly o darling of the kurus
but if the bodybearer dies at the time when sattva is on the increase then he attains to the spotless worlds of those who know the highest
by meeting death when the rajas is on the increase he is born among those who are attached to action likewise meeting death when the tamas is on the increase he is born in the wombs of the duluded
the fruit of good action they say is spotless and is of the sattva but the fruit of the rajas is pain and the fruit of the tamas is ignorance
from the sattva arises wisdom from the rajas only greed and from the tamas arise negligence delusion and also ignorance
those who are established in the sattva go upward the persons given to the rajas remain in the middle state those who are given to the tamas being established in the tendencies of bad alities go downwards
when the perceiver the self finds no agent other than the strands and realises that which is beyond the strands then he attains my state
transcending these three strands of which the body etc is born the embodied the soul being freed from birth death old age and sorrow attains immortality
arjuna said o master with what characteristic marks does he who has transcended these three strands exist of what behaviour is he and how does he pass beyond these three strands
the bhagavat said o son of pandu he does niether abhor nor crave for illumination and exertion and delusion too as and when they arise or cease to be
he who sitting like an unconcerned person is not perturbed by the strands who is ignorant that the strands exist or who remain simply aware that the strands alone exist who is not shaken
to whom pain pleasure and sleep are alike to whom a cold a stone and a lump of gold are alike to whom both the pleasant and the unpleasant things are eal who is firm in mind to whom blame and personal commendation are eal
who remains eal to honour and to dishonour and eal to the sides of both the friend and the foe and who has given up all fruits of his initiativeshe is said to have transcended the strands
whosoever serves me alone with an unfailing devotionyoga he transcending these strands turns to be the brahman
i is the place of support for the immortal and changeless brahman and for its eternal attribute the unalloyed happiness
the bhagavat said the scriptures speak of a nonperishing holy figtree which has root that is high or above and branches that are low or below and of which the vedic hymns are leaveshe who knows this tree is the knower of the vedas
of which tree the branches spreading downward and upward well developed with strands have sense objects as sprouts also below in the human world are its roots stretching successively having actions for their subknots
the nature of this is not perceived in that manner nor its end nor its beginning and nor its centre the middle cutting this holy figtreewith its firmly and variedly grown rootsby means of the sharp or strong exe of nonattachment
then that abode must be sought having reached which one would not return the yogin would attain nothing but that primal person from whom the old activity world creation commences
those who are rid of pride and delusion have put down the evils of attachment remain constantly in their own nature of the self have their desires completely departed and are fully liberated from the pairs known as pleasures and painsthese undeluded men go to that changeless abode
the sun does not illumine that nor the moon and nor the fire that is my abode supreme having gone to which they yogins never return
a portion just of my own self having become the eternal individual soul in the world of the living ones draws into service the sense organs of which the sixth is the mind and which rest in the prakrti
whatsoever body he attains to and also from whatsoever he goes up the lord proceeds taking them with him just as the wind takes odours from their receptacle
presiding over the ear the eye the touchsense the tastesense and also the smellsense and the mind he enjoys the sense objects
the deluded do not perceive but the men of knowledgeeye do see him as he dwells of rises up or enjoys what is endowed with strands
the exerting men of yoga perceive him dwelling in the self but the unintelligent men with their uncontrolled self do not perceive him even though they exert
that light which is found in the sun which is in the moon and which is also in the fireall illuminating the entire worldknow that light to be of mine
and penetrating the earth i support all beings with my energy being the sapful moon i nourish all plants
being the digestive fire dwelling within the body of living creatures and being in association with the upward and downward winds of the body i digest the four kinds of food
i am entered the selfconciousness is felt in the heart of all from me this selfconsciousness come the faculty of memory the faculty of knowing and also the faculty of differentiating none but me is to be known by means of all the vedas and i am alone the author of the final part of the vedas and also the author of the vedas themselves
there are two persons in the world the perishing and the nonperishing the perishing is all elements and the speaklike one is called the nonperishing
but the highest person distinct from both this is spoken of as the supreme self which being the changeless lord sustains the triad of the world by entering into it
becuase i have transcended the perishing and also the nonperishing therefore i am acclaimed in the world as well as in the veda as the highest of persons
he who being not deluded thus knows me as the highest of persons he knows all and serves me with his entire being o descendant of bharata
thus the most secret scripture has been taught by me o sinless one by understanding this let a man become wise and also become one who has accomplished what reires to be accomplished o descendant of bharata
the bhagavat said fearlessness complete purity of the sattva steadfastness in knowledgeyoga charity and selfrestraint and vedic sacrifice recitation of scriptures austerity uprightness
harmlessness truth absence of anger renunciation absence of attachment absence of calumny compassion to living beings and absence of greed gentleness modesty absence of thoughtlessness
vital power forgiveness fortitude contenment absence of treachery and absence of excessive pridethese are in the person who is born for divine wealth o descendant of bharata
ostentation arrogance pride anger and also harshness and ignorance are in the person born for the demoniac wealth o son of prtha
the divine wealth is meant for total emancipation and the demoniac one is meant for complete bondage grieve not o son of pandu for the divine wealth you are born
there are two types of creations of beings in this world viz the divine and also the demoniac the divine one has been properly described in detail hear now the demoniac one from me o son of prtha
the demoniac men do not know the origin and the withdrawal neither purity nor good conduct nor truth does exist in them
they say that this world is without truth has no basis and has no lord this is born not on the basis of the mutual causeandeffectrelation of the things it has nothing beyond and has no cause
clinging to this view the inauspcious men of the ruined souls of the poor intellect and of the cruel deeds strive for the destruction of the world
holding to their insatiable desire being possessed by hypocricy avarice and pride and holding evil intention these cruel men wander with impure resolve
adhering to their anxiety that is ultimited and may end only at the time of dissolution viewing the gratification of their desires alone as their highest goal ascertaining that this much alone exists
being bound by hundreds of ropes of longing and being devoted to their desire and anger they seek by unjust means hoards with wealth for the purpose of the gratification of their desires
this has been gained by me today this object of my desire i shall attain in future this is mine now and this wealth also shall be mine soon
that enemy has been slain by me and i shall slay others also i am the lord i am a man of enjoyment i am successful mighty and happy
i am rich i am of of noble birth who else is eal ot me i shall perform sacrifices i shall give gifts and i shall rejoice deluded by these wrong ideas
endowed with many thoughts confused highly enslaved simply by their delusion and addicated to the gratification of desires they fall into the hell and into what is foul
selfconceited stubborn filled with pride and arrogance of wealth they pretend to perform sacrifices with hypocricy not following injunction of the vedas
clinging fast to egotism force pride craving and anger these envious men hate me in the bodies of their own and of others
these hateful cruel basest men i hurl incessantly into the inauspicious demoniac wombs alone in the cycle of birthanddeath
having come to the demoniac womb birth after birth and not attaining me at all these deluded persons therefore pass to the lowest state o son of kunti
to the hell threefold is the gate that ruins the self they are desire anger as well as greed hence one should avoid these three
o son of kunti a man who has deserted these three gates of darkness does what is good for his self and thery reaches the highest goal
he who neglects the injunction of the scriptures and acts according to his own willhe attains neither the success nor happiness nor the highest goal emancipation
therefore by considering the scripture as your authority in determining as to what is to be done and what is not to be done you should perform action laid down by the regulations of the scriptures
arjuna said those who remain with faith but neglecting the scriptural injunction what is their state is it sattva rajas or tamas o krsna
the bhagavat said the faith of the embodied persons is born of their nature and is of three kinds viz that which is made of the sattva that which is made of the rajas and that which is made of the tamas listen about them
corresponding to ones own sattva everybody has faith o descendant of bharata the person predominantly consists of the faith what one has faith in that he is becomes certainly
the men of the sattva strand perform sacrifice intending for the gods the men of the rajas strand do for the spirits and the demons and the men of the tamas strand perform sacrifices intending for the imps the dead and the ghosts
those men who practise terrible austerities not as enjoined in the scriptures who are bound to hypocricy and conceit and are endowed with ie impelled by the force of passion for the desired objects
who emaciate unintelligently the conglamoration of elements in their physic and emaciate me too dwelling within the physicknow them to be of a demoniac resolve
further the food also which is dear to all is of three kinds so are their sacrifice austerity and charity listen to this distinction of them
the foods that increase life energy strength good health happiness and satisfaction and which are delicious soft substantial and pleasant to heart stomach they are dear to the men of the sattva strand
the foods that are killed by men of the rajas strand are those which are bitter sour saltish very hot harsh dry and burning and which cause pain grief and disease
what is old bereft of taste illsmelling and stale what is also left after eating and is impure such a food is dear to the men of the tamas strand
that sacrifice is of the sattva strand which is offered as found in the injunction by men craving for no fruit by stabilizing their mind with the thought that it is just a thing to be offered
what is offered aiming at fruit and also only for the sake of displayknow that sacrifice to be of the rajas strand and to be transitary and impermanent
that sacrifice they declare to be of the tamas strand which is devoid of scriptural injunction in which there is no recitation of vedic hymns where no food and sacrifical fee are distributed and which is totally devoid of faith
the worship to the gods to the twiceborn to the elders and to the wise the purity the honesty the state of continence and the harmlessnessall this is said to be bodily austerity
the unoffending speech which is true and which is pleasant and beneficial and also the practice of regular recitation of the vedas all this is said to be an austerity by the speechsense
the serenity of mind the ietness the taciturnity the selfcontrol the purity of thoughtall this is called mental austerity
this threefold austerity undertaken observed with best faith by men who are maters of yoga and have no desire for its fruitsthey call it to be of the sattva
the austerity that is practised for gaining respect honour and reverence and with sheer showingthat is called here austerity of the rajas and it is unstable and impermanent
what austerity is practised with foolish obstinacy and with selftorture only in order to destroy other personthat is declared to be of the tamas
a gift which is given with the thought that one must give and is given in a proper place and at correct time to a worthy person incapable of obliging in returnthat gift is held to be of the sattva
but what is given to get a return of favour or again with a view to a fruit and which is very much vexed that gift is held to be of the rajas
the gift which is given at a wrong place at a wrong time and to unworthy persons and which is converted into a bad act and is disrespected that is declared to be of the tamas
om tat sat this is held to be the threefold indication of the brahman by means of that the vedas and also the sacrifices had been fashioned formerly by brahma
therefore the scriptureprescribed acts of sacrifice gift and austerity of those who are habituated to have brahmandiscourses commence or take place invariably with the utterance of om
with the utterance of tat and without aiming at the fruit the acts of sacrifice and austerity and the various acts of gifts are performed by those who seek emancipation
in the sense of right one or manifesting as being and in the sense of proper one or manifesting perfectly this word sat is employed likewise the word sat is used with regard to the praiseworthy act o son of prtha
the steadfastness is performing sacrifice in austerity and in giving gift is also called sat and also the act for such purpose is hence just called sat
without faith whatever oblation is offered whatever gift is made whatever austerity is practised and whatever action is undertaken that is called asat and it is of no avail after ones death and in this world
arjuna said o mightyarmed i desire to know severally the distinctive nature of renunciation and of relinishment o hrsikesa o slayer of kesin
the bhagavat said the seers understand the act of renouncing the desiremotivated actions as renunciation the experts declare the relinishment of the fruits of all actions to be relinishment
certain wise men delcare that the harmful action is to be relinished while others say that the actions of performing sacrifices giving gifts and observing austerities should not be relinished
o best of bharatas descendants listen to my considered view about relinishing indeed the act of relinishing is rightly spoken to be threefold o best among men
the actions of vedic sacrifice gift and austerity should not be relinished and they must necessarily be performed for the men of wisdom the vedic sacrifice gift and also austerity are the means of purification
even these actions too must be performed by relinishing attachment and fruits this is my considered best opinion o son of prtha
the renunciation of the enjoined action does not stand to reason and completely relinishing it out of ignorance is proclaimed on all sides as an act of the tamas strand
he who would out of fear of bodily exertion relinish an action just because it is painfulthat person having thus made relinishment an act of the rajas strand would not at all gain the fruit of that relinishment
this is a thing to be performedjust on that ground whatever usual action is performed relinishing attachment and also fruitthat act of relinishment is deemed to be of the sattva strand
the man of relinishment who is well possessed of the sattva is wise and has his doubts destroyedhe hates not the unskilled action and clings not to the skilled action
indeed to relinish actions entirely is not possible for a bodybearing one but whosoever relinishes the fruits of actions he is said to be a man of true relinishment
the threefold fruit of action viz the undesired the desired and the mixed accrues even after death ot those who are not men of relinishment but never to those who are men of renunciation
o mightyarmed one learn from me these following five causes that have been declared in the conclusion of deliberations on proper knowledge for the accomplishment of all actions
the basis as well as the agent and diverse instruments and distinct activity of various kinds and destiny which is certainly the fifth factor
o arjuna whatever action is undertaken with the body speech or the mind whether it is lawful or otherwise its factors are these five
but this being the case whosoever views himself as the sole agent cause of actions due to his imperfect intellect he the defectiveminded one does not view things rightly
he whose mental disposition is not dominated by the sense i and whose intellect is not stained he even if he slays these worlds does not really slay any and he is not fettered
the instrument of knowledge the objectofknowledge and the knowing subjectthe promptinginaction consisting of these threefold elements is itself the proper grasping of action with threefold elements viz the instrument the object and the agent
the instrument of knowledge the object and the agent are just three kinds because of the differences in the strandsthus it is declared in enumerating the strands these also you must listen to from me as they are
that instrumentofknowledge by means of which one perceives in all beings the singular immutable existence the unclassified in the classified ones that you must know to be born of the sattva strand
that instrumentofknowledge by means of which one considers the varied natures of different sorts in all beings as really differentthat is regarded to be of the rajas strand
that instrumentofknowledge because of which one not realising the whole gets indulged without reason in a particular activity and which is unconcerned with the real nature of things and is insignificant that is declared to be of the tamas strand
the object that has been acired with determination without attachment and without desire or hatred by one who does not crave to reap the fruit of his action that is declared to be of the sattva strand
the object which is abundant in afflictions and which is further reired by one who craves to attain the desired thing with the feeling of ithat is considered to be of the rajas strand
the object which is gained due to ignorance without considering the result the loss the injury to others and the strength of ones ownthat is declared to be of the tamas strand
the agent who is free from attachment who does not make any speech of egoism who is full of contentment and enthusiasm and who does not change mentally in success or in failurethat agent is said to be of the sattva strand nature
the agent who is a man of passion who craves for the fruit of his action and is avaricious who is injurious by nature is impure and is overpowered by joy and griefthat agent is proclaimed to be of the rajas strand
the agent who does not exert is vulgar obstinate and deceitful who is a man of wickedness and is lazy sorrowful and procrastinating that agent is said to be of the tamas strand
you must listen from me to the threefold division of the intellect and also of content both being expounded completely and individually by me basing on the strands o dhananjaya
the intellect which knows the activity and the cessation from the activity the proper and improper actions the fear and nonfear and the bondage and emancipationthat intellect is considered to be of the sattva strand
the intellect by means of which one decides incorrectly the righteous and the unrighteous ones and what is a proper action and also an improper onethat intellect is of the rajas strand o son of prtha
the intellect which containing darkness ignorance conceives the unrighteous one as righteous and all things topsyturvythat intellect is deemed to be of the tamas strand
the unfailing content because of which one restrains with yoga the activities of mind the living breath and the sensesthat content is considered to be of the sattva strand
o arjuna the content by which one restrains ones bounden duty pleasure and wealth and conseently desiring the fruits of actionthat content is of the rajas strand o son of prtha
the content whery a foolish man does not give up his sleep fear grief despondency and also arrogancethat content is deemed to be of the tamas strand
o best among the bharatas now from me you must also listen to the threefold happiness where one gets delighted by practice and attains the end of suffering
the happiness which is like poison at its time but is like nectar at the time of its resultthat happiness born of serenity of the soul and intellect you must know to be of the sattva strand
the happiness which is like nectar at its time due to the contact between the senses and senseobjects but which is like poison at the time of its resultthat is considered to be of the rajas strand
the happiness which both at the beginning and subseently is of the nature of deluding the self and which results from sleep indolence and heedlenessthat is stated to be of the tamas strand
whether on the earth or again among the gods in the heaven there exists not a single being which is free from these three strands born of the materialnature
the duties of the brahmanas the ksatriyas the vaisyas and of the sudras are properly classified according to the strands which are the sources of their nature o scorcher of foes
quietude selfcontrol as well as purity forbearance and also straightforwardness knowledge wisdom and faith in another world are the duties of the brahmanas born of their nature
heroic deed fiery energy firmness dexterity and also nonfeeling form battle giving gifts overlordship are the duties of the ksatriyas born of their nature
ploughing cattletending and trading are the actions of the vaisyas born of their nature the action in the form of service is of the sudras born of their nature
a man devoted to his own respective action attains success devoted to ones own action how one attains success that you must hear from me
that whence the activities of the beings arise by which this universe is pervadedworshipping that by ones own prescribed action a man attains success
better is ones own prescribed duties born of ones nature even though it is devoid of ality than anothers duty well executed the doer of duty dependent on or prescribed according to ones own nature does not incur sin
o son of kunti one should not give up the natureborn duty even if it is appears to be defective for all beginnings are enveloped by harm just as the fire by smoke
he whose mind entertains no attachment to anything who is selfconered and is free from cravinghe attains by means of renunciation the supreme success of actionlessness
having attained the success how he attains the brahman an attainment which is confirmed to be the final beatitude of true knowledgethat you must learn from me briefly
he who has got a totally pure intellect by fully controlling his self mind with firmness and renouncing senseobjects sound etc and driving out desire and hatred
who enjoys solitude eats lightly has controlled his speechorgan body and mind who is permanently devoted to the meditationyoga and who has taken shelter in the perennial desirelessness
relinshing egotism violence pride desire wrath and the sense of possessionhe the unselfish and calm one is capable of becoming the brahman
having become the brahman the sereneminded one neither grieves nor rejoices remaining eal to all beings he gains the highest devotion to me
through devotion he comes to know of me who i am and how in fact i amhaving correctly known me he enters me then afterwards
performing all his actions all the time and taking refuge in me he attains through my grace the eternal changeless state
hence renouncing by mind all actions in me o descendant of bharata and taking hold of the knowledgeyoga you must always be with your thoughtorgan turned towards me

the elder unto the wellbeloved gaius whom i love in the truth
beloved i wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health even as thy soul prospereth
for i rejoiced greatly when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee even as thou walkest in the truth
i have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth
beloved thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren and to strangers
which have borne witness of thy charity before the church whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort thou shalt do well
because that for his names sake they went forth taking nothing of the gentiles
we therefore ought to receive such that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth
i wrote unto the church but diotrephes who loveth to have the preeminence among them receiveth us not
wherefore if i come i will remember his deeds which he doeth prating against us with malicious words and not content therewith neither doth he himself receive the brethren and forbiddeth them that would and casteth them out of the church
beloved follow not that which is evil but that which is good he that doeth good is of god but he that doeth evil hath not seen god
demetrius hath good report of all men and of the truth itself yea and we also bear record and ye know that our record is true
i had many things to write but i will not with ink and pen write unto thee

in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god
the same was in the beginning with god
all things were made by him and without him was not any thing made that was made
in him was life and the life was the light of men
and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not
there was a man sent from god whose name was john
the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe
he was not that light but was sent to bear witness of that light
that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world
he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not
he came unto his own and his own received him not
but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name
which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god
and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth
john bare witness of him and cried saying this was he of whom i spake he that cometh after me is preferred before me for he was before me
and of his fulness have all we received and grace for grace
for the law was given by moses but grace and truth came by jesus christ
no man hath seen god at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him
and this is the record of john when the jews sent priests and levites from jerusalem to ask him who art thou
and he confessed and denied not but confessed i am not the christ
and they asked him what then art thou elias and he saith i am not art thou that prophet and he answered no
then said they unto him who art thou that we may give an answer to them that sent us what sayest thou of thyself
he said i am the voice of one crying in the wilderness make straight the way of the lord as said the prophet esaias
and they which were sent were of the pharisees
and they asked him and said unto him why baptizest thou then if thou be not that christ nor elias neither that prophet
john answered them saying i baptize with water but there standeth one among you whom ye know not
he it is who coming after me is preferred before me whose shoes latchet i am not worthy to unloose
these things were done in bethabara beyond jordan where john was baptizing
the next day john seeth jesus coming unto him and saith behold the lamb of god which taketh away the sin of the world
this is he of whom i said after me cometh a man which is preferred before me for he was before me
and i knew him not but that he should be made manifest to israel therefore am i come baptizing with water
and john bare record saying i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it abode upon him
and i knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same is he which baptizeth with the holy ghost
and i saw and bare record that this is the son of god
again the next day after john stood and two of his disciples
and looking upon jesus as he walked he saith behold the lamb of god
and the two disciples heard him speak and they followed jesus
then jesus turned and saw them following and saith unto them what seek ye they said unto him rabbi which is to say being interpreted master where dwellest thou
he saith unto them come and see they came and saw where he dwelt and abode with him that day for it was about the tenth hour
one of the two which heard john speak and followed him was andrew simon peters brother
he first findeth his own brother simon and saith unto him we have found the messias which is being interpreted the christ
and he brought him to jesus and when jesus beheld him he said thou art simon the son of jona thou shalt be called cephas which is by interpretation a stone
the day following jesus would go forth into galilee and findeth philip and saith unto him follow me
now philip was of bethsaida the city of andrew and peter
philip findeth nathanael and saith unto him we have found him of whom moses in the law and the prophets did write jesus of nazareth the son of joseph
and nathanael said unto him can there any good thing come out of nazareth philip saith unto him come and see
jesus saw nathanael coming to him and saith of him behold an israelite indeed in whom is no guile
nathanael saith unto him whence knowest thou me jesus answered and said unto him before that philip called thee when thou wast under the fig tree i saw thee
nathanael answered and saith unto him rabbi thou art the son of god thou art the king of israel
jesus answered and said unto him because i said unto thee i saw thee under the fig tree believest thou thou shalt see greater things than these
and he saith unto him verily verily i say unto you hereafter ye shall see heaven open and the angels of god ascending and descending upon the son of man
and the third day there was a marriage in cana of galilee and the mother of jesus was there
and both jesus was called and his disciples to the marriage
and when they wanted wine the mother of jesus saith unto him they have no wine
jesus saith unto her woman what have i to do with thee mine hour is not yet come
his mother saith unto the servants whatsoever he saith unto you do it
and there were set there six waterpots of stone after the manner of the purifying of the jews containing two or three firkins apiece
jesus saith unto them fill the waterpots with water and they filled them up to the brim
and he saith unto them draw out now and bear unto the governor of the feast and they bare it
when the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine and knew not whence it was but the servants which drew the water knew the governor of the feast called the bridegroom
and saith unto him every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine and when men have well drunk then that which is worse but thou hast kept the good wine until now
this beginning of miracles did jesus in cana of galilee and manifested forth his glory and his disciples believed on him
after this he went down to capernaum he and his mother and his brethren and his disciples and they continued there not many days
and the jews passover was at hand and jesus went up to jerusalem
and found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves and the changers of money sitting
and when he had made a scourge of small cords he drove them all out of the temple and the sheep and the oxen and poured out the changers money and overthrew the tables
and said unto them that sold doves take these things hence make not my fathers house an house of merchandise
and his disciples remembered that it was written the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up
then answered the jews and said unto him what sign shewest thou unto us seeing that thou doest these things
jesus answered and said unto them destroy this temple and in three days i will raise it up
then said the jews forty and six years was this temple in building and wilt thou rear it up in three days
but he spake of the temple of his body
when therefore he was risen from the dead his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them and they believed the scripture and the word which jesus had said
now when he was in jerusalem at the passover in the feast day many believed in his name when they saw the miracles which he did
but jesus did not commit himself unto them because he knew all men
and needed not that any should testify of man for he knew what was in man
there was a man of the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of the jews
the same came to jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from god for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except god be with him
jesus answered and said unto him verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god
nicodemus saith unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mothers womb and be born
jesus answered verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god
that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit
marvel not that i said unto thee ye must be born again
the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the sound thereof but canst not tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth so is every one that is born of the spirit
nicodemus answered and said unto him how can these things be
jesus answered and said unto him art thou a master of israel and knowest not these things
verily verily i say unto thee we speak that we do know and testify that we have seen and ye receive not our witness
if i have told you earthly things and ye believe not how shall ye believe if i tell you of heavenly things
and no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven
and as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up
that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life
for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life
for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved
he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god
and this is the condemnation that light is come into the world and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil
for every one that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved
but he that doeth truth cometh to the light that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in god
after these things came jesus and his disciples into the land of judaea and there he tarried with them and baptized
and john also was baptizing in aenon near to salim because there was much water there and they came and were baptized
for john was not yet cast into prison
then there arose a question between some of johns disciples and the jews about purifying
and they came unto john and said unto him rabbi he that was with thee beyond jordan to whom thou barest witness behold the same baptizeth and all men come to him
john answered and said a man can receive nothing except it be given him from heaven
ye yourselves bear me witness that i said i am not the christ but that i am sent before him
he that hath the bride is the bridegroom but the friend of the bridegroom which standeth and heareth him rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegrooms voice this my joy therefore is fulfilled
he must increase but i must decrease
he that cometh from above is above all he that is of the earth is earthly and speaketh of the earth he that cometh from heaven is above all
and what he hath seen and heard that he testifieth and no man receiveth his testimony
he that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that god is true
for he whom god hath sent speaketh the words of god for god giveth not the spirit by measure unto him
the father loveth the son and hath given all things into his hand
he that believeth on the son hath everlasting life and he that believeth not the son shall not see life but the wrath of god abideth on him
when therefore the lord knew how the pharisees had heard that jesus made and baptized more disciples than john
though jesus himself baptized not but his disciples
he left judaea and departed again into galilee
and he must needs go through samaria
then cometh he to a city of samaria which is called sychar near to the parcel of ground that jacob gave to his son joseph
now jacobs well was there jesus therefore being wearied with his journey sat thus on the well and it was about the sixth hour
there cometh a woman of samaria to draw water jesus saith unto her give me to drink
for his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat
then saith the woman of samaria unto him how is it that thou being a jew askest drink of me which am a woman of samaria for the jews have no dealings with the samaritans
jesus answered and said unto her if thou knewest the gift of god and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink thou wouldest have asked of him and he would have given thee living water
the woman saith unto him sir thou hast nothing to draw with and the well is deep from whence then hast thou that living water
art thou greater than our father jacob which gave us the well and drank thereof himself and his children and his cattle
jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again
but whosoever drinketh of the water that i shall give him shall never thirst but the water that i shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life
the woman saith unto him sir give me this water that i thirst not neither come hither to draw
jesus saith unto her go call thy husband and come hither
the woman answered and said i have no husband jesus said unto her thou hast well said i have no husband
for thou hast had five husbands and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband in that saidst thou truly
the woman saith unto him sir i perceive that thou art a prophet
our fathers worshipped in this mountain and ye say that in jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship
jesus saith unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at jerusalem worship the father
ye worship ye know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the jews
but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him
god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth
the woman saith unto him i know that messias cometh which is called christ when he is come he will tell us all things
jesus saith unto her i that speak unto thee am he
and upon this came his disciples and marvelled that he talked with the woman yet no man said what seekest thou or why talkest thou with her
the woman then left her waterpot and went her way into the city and saith to the men
come see a man which told me all things that ever i did is not this the christ
then they went out of the city and came unto him
in the mean while his disciples prayed him saying master eat
but he said unto them i have meat to eat that ye know not of
therefore said the disciples one to another hath any man brought him ought to eat
jesus saith unto them my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work
say not ye there are yet four months and then cometh harvest behold i say unto you lift up your eyes and look on the fields for they are white already to harvest
and he that reapeth receiveth wages and gathereth fruit unto life eternal that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together
and herein is that saying true one soweth and another reapeth
i sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour other men laboured and ye are entered into their labours
and many of the samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman which testified he told me all that ever i did
so when the samaritans were come unto him they besought him that he would tarry with them and he abode there two days
and many more believed because of his own word
and said unto the woman now we believe not because of thy saying for we have heard him ourselves and know that this is indeed the christ the saviour of the world
now after two days he departed thence and went into galilee
for jesus himself testified that a prophet hath no honour in his own country
then when he was come into galilee the galilaeans received him having seen all the things that he did at jerusalem at the feast for they also went unto the feast
so jesus came again into cana of galilee where he made the water wine and there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at capernaum
when he heard that jesus was come out of judaea into galilee he went unto him and besought him that he would come down and heal his son for he was at the point of death
then said jesus unto him except ye see signs and wonders ye will not believe
the nobleman saith unto him sir come down ere my child die
jesus saith unto him go thy way thy son liveth and the man believed the word that jesus had spoken unto him and he went his way
and as he was now going down his servants met him and told him saying thy son liveth
then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend and they said unto him yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him
so the father knew that it was at the same hour in the which jesus said unto him thy son liveth and himself believed and his whole house
this is again the second miracle that jesus did when he was come out of judaea into galilee
after this there was a feast of the jews and jesus went up to jerusalem
now there is at jerusalem by the sheep market a pool which is called in the hebrew tongue bethesda having five porches
in these lay a great multitude of impotent folk of blind halt withered waiting for the moving of the water
for an angel went down at a certain season into the pool and troubled the water whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had
and a certain man was there which had an infirmity thirty and eight years
when jesus saw him lie and knew that he had been now a long time in that case he saith unto him wilt thou be made whole
the impotent man answered him sir i have no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool but while i am coming another steppeth down before me
jesus saith unto him rise take up thy bed and walk
and immediately the man was made whole and took up his bed and walked and on the same day was the sabbath
the jews therefore said unto him that was cured it is the sabbath day it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed
he answered them he that made me whole the same said unto me take up thy bed and walk
then asked they him what man is that which said unto thee take up thy bed and walk
and he that was healed wist not who it was for jesus had conveyed himself away a multitude being in that place
afterward jesus findeth him in the temple and said unto him behold thou art made whole sin no more lest a worse thing come unto thee
the man departed and told the jews that it was jesus which had made him whole
and therefore did the jews persecute jesus and sought to slay him because he had done these things on the sabbath day
but jesus answered them my father worketh hitherto and i work
therefore the jews sought the more to kill him because he not only had broken the sabbath but said also that god was his father making himself equal with god
then answered jesus and said unto them verily verily i say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what things soever he doeth these also doeth the son likewise
for the father loveth the son and sheweth him all things that himself doeth and he will shew him greater works than these that ye may marvel
for as the father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them even so the son quickeneth whom he will
for the father judgeth no man but hath committed all judgment unto the son
that all men should honour the son even as they honour the father he that honoureth not the son honoureth not the father which hath sent him
verily verily i say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death unto life
verily verily i say unto you the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of god and they that hear shall live
for as the father hath life in himself so hath he given to the son to have life in himself
and hath given him authority to execute judgment also because he is the son of man
marvel not at this for the hour is coming in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice
and shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation
i can of mine own self do nothing as i hear i judge and my judgment is just because i seek not mine own will but the will of the father which hath sent me
if i bear witness of myself my witness is not true
there is another that beareth witness of me and i know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true
ye sent unto john and he bare witness unto the truth
but i receive not testimony from man but these things i say that ye might be saved
he was a burning and a shining light and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light
but i have greater witness than that of john for the works which the father hath given me to finish the same works that i do bear witness of me that the father hath sent me
and the father himself which hath sent me hath borne witness of me ye have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his shape
and ye have not his word abiding in you for whom he hath sent him ye believe not
search the scriptures for in them ye think ye have eternal life and they are they which testify of me
and ye will not come to me that ye might have life
i receive not honour from men
but i know you that ye have not the love of god in you
i am come in my fathers name and ye receive me not if another shall come in his own name him ye will receive
how can ye believe which receive honour one of another and seek not the honour that cometh from god only
do not think that i will accuse you to the father there is one that accuseth you even moses in whom ye trust
for had ye believed moses ye would have believed me for he wrote of me
but if ye believe not his writings how shall ye believe my words
after these things jesus went over the sea of galilee which is the sea of tiberias
and a great multitude followed him because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased
and jesus went up into a mountain and there he sat with his disciples
and the passover a feast of the jews was nigh
when jesus then lifted up his eyes and saw a great company come unto him he saith unto philip whence shall we buy bread that these may eat
and this he said to prove him for he himself knew what he would do
philip answered him two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them that every one of them may take a little
one of his disciples andrew simon peters brother saith unto him
there is a lad here which hath five barley loaves and two small fishes but what are they among so many
and jesus said make the men sit down now there was much grass in the place so the men sat down in number about five thousand
and jesus took the loaves and when he had given thanks he distributed to the disciples and the disciples to them that were set down and likewise of the fishes as much as they would
when they were filled he said unto his disciples gather up the fragments that remain that nothing be lost
therefore they gathered them together and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves which remained over and above unto them that had eaten
then those men when they had seen the miracle that jesus did said this is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world
when jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force to make him a king he departed again into a mountain himself alone
and when even was now come his disciples went down unto the sea
and entered into a ship and went over the sea toward capernaum and it was now dark and jesus was not come to them
and the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew
so when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs they see jesus walking on the sea and drawing nigh unto the ship and they were afraid
but he saith unto them it is i be not afraid
then they willingly received him into the ship and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went
the day following when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there save that one whereinto his disciples were entered and that jesus went not with his disciples into the boat but that his disciples were gone away alone
howbeit there came other boats from tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread after that the lord had given thanks
when the people therefore saw that jesus was not there neither his disciples they also took shipping and came to capernaum seeking for jesus
and when they had found him on the other side of the sea they said unto him rabbi when camest thou hither
jesus answered them and said verily verily i say unto you ye seek me not because ye saw the miracles but because ye did eat of the loaves and were filled
labour not for the meat which perisheth but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life which the son of man shall give unto you for him hath god the father sealed
then said they unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of god
jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of god that ye believe on him whom he hath sent
they said therefore unto him what sign shewest thou then that we may see and believe thee what dost thou work
our fathers did eat manna in the desert as it is written he gave them bread from heaven to eat
then jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven
for the bread of god is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world
then said they unto him lord evermore give us this bread
and jesus said unto them i am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst
but i said unto you that ye also have seen me and believe not
all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out
for i came down from heaven not to do mine own will but the will of him that sent me
and this is the fathers will which hath sent me that of all which he hath given me i should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day
and this is the will of him that sent me that every one which seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and i will raise him up at the last day
the jews then murmured at him because he said i am the bread which came down from heaven
and they said is not this jesus the son of joseph whose father and mother we know how is it then that he saith i came down from heaven
jesus therefore answered and said unto them murmur not among yourselves
no man can come to me except the father which hath sent me draw him and i will raise him up at the last day
it is written in the prophets and they shall be all taught of god every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the father cometh unto me
not that any man hath seen the father save he which is of god he hath seen the father
verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me hath everlasting life
i am that bread of life
your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness and are dead
this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die
i am the living bread which came down from heaven if any man eat of this bread he shall live for ever and the bread that i will give is my flesh which i will give for the life of the world
the jews therefore strove among themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat
then jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you except ye eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood ye have no life in you
whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and i will raise him up at the last day
for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed
he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and i in him
as the living father hath sent me and i live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me
this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eat manna and are dead he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever
these things said he in the synagogue as he taught in capernaum
many therefore of his disciples when they had heard this said this is an hard saying who can hear it
when jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it he said unto them doth this offend you
what and if ye shall see the son of man ascend up where he was before
it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life
but there are some of you that believe not for jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not and who should betray him
and he said therefore said i unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my father
from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him
then said jesus unto the twelve will ye also go away
then simon peter answered him lord to whom shall we go thou hast the words of eternal life
and we believe and are sure that thou art that christ the son of the living god
jesus answered them have not i chosen you twelve and one of you is a devil
he spake of judas iscariot the son of simon for he it was that should betray him being one of the twelve
after these things jesus walked in galilee for he would not walk in jewry because the jews sought to kill him
now the jews feast of tabernacles was at hand
his brethren therefore said unto him depart hence and go into judaea that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest
for there is no man that doeth any thing in secret and he himself seeketh to be known openly if thou do these things shew thyself to the world
for neither did his brethren believe in him
then jesus said unto them my time is not yet come but your time is alway ready
the world cannot hate you but me it hateth because i testify of it that the works thereof are evil
go ye up unto this feast i go not up yet unto this feast for my time is not yet full come
when he had said these words unto them he abode still in galilee
but when his brethren were gone up then went he also up unto the feast not openly but as it were in secret
then the jews sought him at the feast and said where is he
and there was much murmuring among the people concerning him for some said he is a good man others said nay but he deceiveth the people
howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the jews
now about the midst of the feast jesus went up into the temple and taught
and the jews marvelled saying how knoweth this man letters having never learned
jesus answered them and said my doctrine is not mine but his that sent me
if any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of god or whether i speak of myself
he that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory but he that seeketh his glory that sent him the same is true and no unrighteousness is in him
did not moses give you the law and yet none of you keepeth the law why go ye about to kill me
the people answered and said thou hast a devil who goeth about to kill thee
jesus answered and said unto them i have done one work and ye all marvel
moses therefore gave unto you circumcision not because it is of moses but of the fathers and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man
if a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision that the law of moses should not be broken are ye angry at me because i have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day
judge not according to the appearance but judge righteous judgment
then said some of them of jerusalem is not this he whom they seek to kill
but lo he speaketh boldly and they say nothing unto him do the rulers know indeed that this is the very christ
howbeit we know this man whence he is but when christ cometh no man knoweth whence he is
then cried jesus in the temple as he taught saying ye both know me and ye know whence i am and i am not come of myself but he that sent me is true whom ye know not
but i know him for i am from him and he hath sent me
then they sought to take him but no man laid hands on him because his hour was not yet come
and many of the people believed on him and said when christ cometh will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done
the pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him and the pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him
then said jesus unto them yet a little while am i with you and then i go unto him that sent me
ye shall seek me and shall not find me and where i am thither ye cannot come
then said the jews among themselves whither will he go that we shall not find him will he go unto the dispersed among the gentiles and teach the gentiles
what manner of saying is this that he said ye shall seek me and shall not find me and where i am thither ye cannot come
in the last day that great day of the feast jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink
he that believeth on me as the scripture hath said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water
but this spake he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the holy ghost was not yet given because that jesus was not yet glorified
many of the people therefore when they heard this saying said of a truth this is the prophet
others said this is the christ but some said shall christ come out of galilee
hath not the scripture said that christ cometh of the seed of david and out of the town of bethlehem where david was
so there was a division among the people because of him
and some of them would have taken him but no man laid hands on him
then came the officers to the chief priests and pharisees and they said unto them why have ye not brought him
the officers answered never man spake like this man
then answered them the pharisees are ye also deceived
have any of the rulers or of the pharisees believed on him
but this people who knoweth not the law are cursed
nicodemus saith unto them he that came to jesus by night being one of them
doth our law judge any man before it hear him and know what he doeth
they answered and said unto him art thou also of galilee search and look for out of galilee ariseth no prophet
and every man went unto his own house
jesus went unto the mount of olives
and early in the morning he came again into the temple and all the people came unto him and he sat down and taught them
and the scribes and pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery and when they had set her in the midst
they say unto him master this woman was taken in adultery in the very act
now moses in the law commanded us that such should be stoned but what sayest thou
this they said tempting him that they might have to accuse him but jesus stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground as though he heard them not
so when they continued asking him he lifted up himself and said unto them he that is without sin among you let him first cast a stone at her
and again he stooped down and wrote on the ground
and they which heard it being convicted by their own conscience went out one by one beginning at the eldest even unto the last and jesus was left alone and the woman standing in the midst
when jesus had lifted up himself and saw none but the woman he said unto her woman where are those thine accusers hath no man condemned thee
she said no man lord and jesus said unto her neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more
then spake jesus again unto them saying i am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life
the pharisees therefore said unto him thou bearest record of thyself thy record is not true
jesus answered and said unto them though i bear record of myself yet my record is true for i know whence i came and whither i go but ye cannot tell whence i come and whither i go
ye judge after the flesh i judge no man
and yet if i judge my judgment is true for i am not alone but i and the father that sent me
it is also written in your law that the testimony of two men is true
i am one that bear witness of myself and the father that sent me beareth witness of me
then said they unto him where is thy father jesus answered ye neither know me nor my father if ye had known me ye should have known my father also
these words spake jesus in the treasury as he taught in the temple and no man laid hands on him for his hour was not yet come
then said jesus again unto them i go my way and ye shall seek me and shall die in your sins whither i go ye cannot come
then said the jews will he kill himself because he saith whither i go ye cannot come
and he said unto them ye are from beneath i am from above ye are of this world i am not of this world
i said therefore unto you that ye shall die in your sins for if ye believe not that i am he ye shall die in your sins
then said they unto him who art thou and jesus saith unto them even the same that i said unto you from the beginning
i have many things to say and to judge of you but he that sent me is true and i speak to the world those things which i have heard of him
they understood not that he spake to them of the father
then said jesus unto them when ye have lifted up the son of man then shall ye know that i am he and that i do nothing of myself but as my father hath taught me i speak these things
and he that sent me is with me the father hath not left me alone for i do always those things that please him
as he spake these words many believed on him
then said jesus to those jews which believed on him if ye continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed
and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free
they answered him we be abrahams seed and were never in bondage to any man how sayest thou ye shall be made free
jesus answered them verily verily i say unto you whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin
and the servant abideth not in the house for ever but the son abideth ever
if the son therefore shall make you free ye shall be free indeed
i know that ye are abrahams seed but ye seek to kill me because my word hath no place in you
i speak that which i have seen with my father and ye do that which ye have seen with your father
they answered and said unto him abraham is our father jesus saith unto them if ye were abrahams children ye would do the works of abraham
but now ye seek to kill me a man that hath told you the truth which i have heard of god this did not abraham
ye do the deeds of your father then said they to him we be not born of fornication we have one father even god
jesus said unto them if god were your father ye would love me for i proceeded forth and came from god neither came i of myself but he sent me
why do ye not understand my speech even because ye cannot hear my word
ye are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father ye will do he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it
and because i tell you the truth ye believe me not
which of you convinceth me of sin and if i say the truth why do ye not believe me
he that is of god heareth gods words ye therefore hear them not because ye are not of god
then answered the jews and said unto him say we not well that thou art a samaritan and hast a devil
jesus answered i have not a devil but i honour my father and ye do dishonour me
and i seek not mine own glory there is one that seeketh and judgeth
verily verily i say unto you if a man keep my saying he shall never see death
then said the jews unto him now we know that thou hast a devil abraham is dead and the prophets and thou sayest if a man keep my saying he shall never taste of death
art thou greater than our father abraham which is dead and the prophets are dead whom makest thou thyself
jesus answered if i honour myself my honour is nothing it is my father that honoureth me of whom ye say that he is your god
yet ye have not known him but i know him and if i should say i know him not i shall be a liar like unto you but i know him and keep his saying
your father abraham rejoiced to see my day and he saw it and was glad
then said the jews unto him thou art not yet fifty years old and hast thou seen abraham
jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you before abraham was i am
then took they up stones to cast at him but jesus hid himself and went out of the temple going through the midst of them and so passed by
and as jesus passed by he saw a man which was blind from his birth
and his disciples asked him saying master who did sin this man or his parents that he was born blind
jesus answered neither hath this man sinned nor his parents but that the works of god should be made manifest in him
i must work the works of him that sent me while it is day the night cometh when no man can work
as long as i am in the world i am the light of the world
when he had thus spoken he spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay
and said unto him go wash in the pool of siloam which is by interpretation sent he went his way therefore and washed and came seeing
the neighbours therefore and they which before had seen him that he was blind said is not this he that sat and begged
some said this is he others said he is like him but he said i am he
therefore said they unto him how were thine eyes opened
he answered and said a man that is called jesus made clay and anointed mine eyes and said unto me go to the pool of siloam and wash and i went and washed and i received sight
then said they unto him where is he he said i know not
they brought to the pharisees him that aforetime was blind
and it was the sabbath day when jesus made the clay and opened his eyes
then again the pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight he said unto them he put clay upon mine eyes and i washed and do see
therefore said some of the pharisees this man is not of god because he keepeth not the sabbath day others said how can a man that is a sinner do such miracles and there was a division among them
they say unto the blind man again what sayest thou of him that he hath opened thine eyes he said he is a prophet
but the jews did not believe concerning him that he had been blind and received his sight until they called the parents of him that had received his sight
and they asked them saying is this your son who ye say was born blind how then doth he now see
his parents answered them and said we know that this is our son and that he was born blind
but by what means he now seeth we know not or who hath opened his eyes we know not he is of age ask him he shall speak for himself
these words spake his parents because they feared the jews for the jews had agreed already that if any man did confess that he was christ he should be put out of the synagogue
therefore said his parents he is of age ask him
then again called they the man that was blind and said unto him give god the praise we know that this man is a sinner
he answered and said whether he be a sinner or no i know not one thing i know that whereas i was blind now i see
then said they to him again what did he to thee how opened he thine eyes
he answered them i have told you already and ye did not hear wherefore would ye hear it again will ye also be his disciples
then they reviled him and said thou art his disciple but we are moses disciples
we know that god spake unto moses as for this fellow we know not from whence he is
the man answered and said unto them why herein is a marvellous thing that ye know not from whence he is and yet he hath opened mine eyes
now we know that god heareth not sinners but if any man be a worshipper of god and doeth his will him he heareth
since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind
if this man were not of god he could do nothing
they answered and said unto him thou wast altogether born in sins and dost thou teach us and they cast him out
jesus heard that they had cast him out and when he had found him he said unto him dost thou believe on the son of god
he answered and said who is he lord that i might believe on him
and jesus said unto him thou hast both seen him and it is he that talketh with thee
and he said lord i believe and he worshipped him
and jesus said for judgment i am come into this world that they which see not might see and that they which see might be made blind
and some of the pharisees which were with him heard these words and said unto him are we blind also
jesus said unto them if ye were blind ye should have no sin but now ye say we see therefore your sin remaineth
verily verily i say unto you he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up some other way the same is a thief and a robber
but he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep
to him the porter openeth and the sheep hear his voice and he calleth his own sheep by name and leadeth them out
and when he putteth forth his own sheep he goeth before them and the sheep follow him for they know his voice
and a stranger will they not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers
this parable spake jesus unto them but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them
then said jesus unto them again verily verily i say unto you i am the door of the sheep
all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers but the sheep did not hear them
i am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture
the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy i am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly
i am the good shepherd the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep
but he that is an hireling and not the shepherd whose own the sheep are not seeth the wolf coming and leaveth the sheep and fleeth and the wolf catcheth them and scattereth the sheep
the hireling fleeth because he is an hireling and careth not for the sheep
i am the good shepherd and know my sheep and am known of mine
as the father knoweth me even so know i the father and i lay down my life for the sheep
and other sheep i have which are not of this fold them also i must bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold and one shepherd
therefore doth my father love me because i lay down my life that i might take it again
no man taketh it from me but i lay it down of myself i have power to lay it down and i have power to take it again this commandment have i received of my father
there was a division therefore again among the jews for these sayings
and many of them said he hath a devil and is mad why hear ye him
others said these are not the words of him that hath a devil can a devil open the eyes of the blind
and it was at jerusalem the feast of the dedication and it was winter
and jesus walked in the temple in solomons porch
then came the jews round about him and said unto him how long dost thou make us to doubt if thou be the christ tell us plainly
jesus answered them i told you and ye believed not the works that i do in my fathers name they bear witness of me
but ye believe not because ye are not of my sheep as i said unto you
my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me
and i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand
my father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my fathers hand
i and my father are one
then the jews took up stones again to stone him
jesus answered them many good works have i shewed you from my father for which of those works do ye stone me
the jews answered him saying for a good work we stone thee not but for blasphemy and because that thou being a man makest thyself god
jesus answered them is it not written in your law i said ye are gods
if he called them gods unto whom the word of god came and the scripture cannot be broken
say ye of him whom the father hath sanctified and sent into the world thou blasphemest because i said i am the son of god
if i do not the works of my father believe me not
but if i do though ye believe not me believe the works that ye may know and believe that the father is in me and i in him
therefore they sought again to take him but he escaped out of their hand
and went away again beyond jordan into the place where john at first baptized and there he abode
and many resorted unto him and said john did no miracle but all things that john spake of this man were true
and many believed on him there
now a certain man was sick named lazarus of bethany the town of mary and her sister martha
it was that mary which anointed the lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother lazarus was sick
therefore his sisters sent unto him saying lord behold he whom thou lovest is sick
when jesus heard that he said this sickness is not unto death but for the glory of god that the son of god might be glorified thereby
now jesus loved martha and her sister and lazarus
when he had heard therefore that he was sick he abode two days still in the same place where he was
then after that saith he to his disciples let us go into judaea again
his disciples say unto him master the jews of late sought to stone thee and goest thou thither again
jesus answered are there not twelve hours in the day if any man walk in the day he stumbleth not because he seeth the light of this world
but if a man walk in the night he stumbleth because there is no light in him
these things said he and after that he saith unto them our friend lazarus sleepeth but i go that i may awake him out of sleep
then said his disciples lord if he sleep he shall do well
howbeit jesus spake of his death but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep
then said jesus unto them plainly lazarus is dead
and i am glad for your sakes that i was not there to the intent ye may believe nevertheless let us go unto him
then said thomas which is called didymus unto his fellowdisciples let us also go that we may die with him
then when jesus came he found that he had lain in the grave four days already
now bethany was nigh unto jerusalem about fifteen furlongs off
and many of the jews came to martha and mary to comfort them concerning their brother
then martha as soon as she heard that jesus was coming went and met him but mary sat still in the house
then said martha unto jesus lord if thou hadst been here my brother had not died
but i know that even now whatsoever thou wilt ask of god god will give it thee
jesus saith unto her thy brother shall rise again
martha saith unto him i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day
jesus said unto her i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live
and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believest thou this
she saith unto him yea lord i believe that thou art the christ the son of god which should come into the world
and when she had so said she went her way and called mary her sister secretly saying the master is come and calleth for thee
as soon as she heard that she arose quickly and came unto him
now jesus was not yet come into the town but was in that place where martha met him
the jews then which were with her in the house and comforted her when they saw mary that she rose up hastily and went out followed her saying she goeth unto the grave to weep there
then when mary was come where jesus was and saw him she fell down at his feet saying unto him lord if thou hadst been here my brother had not died
when jesus therefore saw her weeping and the jews also weeping which came with her he groaned in the spirit and was troubled
and said where have ye laid him they said unto him lord come and see
jesus wept
then said the jews behold how he loved him
and some of them said could not this man which opened the eyes of the blind have caused that even this man should not have died
jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave it was a cave and a stone lay upon it
jesus said take ye away the stone martha the sister of him that was dead saith unto him lord by this time he stinketh for he hath been dead four days
jesus saith unto her said i not unto thee that if thou wouldest believe thou shouldest see the glory of god
then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid and jesus lifted up his eyes and said father i thank thee that thou hast heard me
and i knew that thou hearest me always but because of the people which stand by i said it that they may believe that thou hast sent me
and when he thus had spoken he cried with a loud voice lazarus come forth
and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with graveclothes and his face was bound about with a napkin jesus saith unto them loose him and let him go
then many of the jews which came to mary and had seen the things which jesus did believed on him
but some of them went their ways to the pharisees and told them what things jesus had done
then gathered the chief priests and the pharisees a council and said what do we for this man doeth many miracles
if we let him thus alone all men will believe on him and the romans shall come and take away both our place and nation
and one of them named caiaphas being the high priest that same year said unto them ye know nothing at all
nor consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people and that the whole nation perish not
and this spake he not of himself but being high priest that year he prophesied that jesus should die for that nation
and not for that nation only but that also he should gather together in one the children of god that were scattered abroad
then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death
jesus therefore walked no more openly among the jews but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness into a city called ephraim and there continued with his disciples
and the jews passover was nigh at hand and many went out of the country up to jerusalem before the passover to purify themselves
then sought they for jesus and spake among themselves as they stood in the temple what think ye that he will not come to the feast
now both the chief priests and the pharisees had given a commandment that if any man knew where he were he should shew it that they might take him
then jesus six days before the passover came to bethany where lazarus was which had been dead whom he raised from the dead
there they made him a supper and martha served but lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him
then took mary a pound of ointment of spikenard very costly and anointed the feet of jesus and wiped his feet with her hair and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment
then saith one of his disciples judas iscariot simons son which should betray him
why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence and given to the poor
this he said not that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief and had the bag and bare what was put therein
then said jesus let her alone against the day of my burying hath she kept this
for the poor always ye have with you but me ye have not always
much people of the jews therefore knew that he was there and they came not for jesus sake only but that they might see lazarus also whom he had raised from the dead
but the chief priests consulted that they might put lazarus also to death
because that by reason of him many of the jews went away and believed on jesus
on the next day much people that were come to the feast when they heard that jesus was coming to jerusalem
took branches of palm trees and went forth to meet him and cried hosanna blessed is the king of israel that cometh in the name of the lord
and jesus when he had found a young ass sat thereon as it is written
fear not daughter of sion behold thy king cometh sitting on an asss colt
these things understood not his disciples at the first but when jesus was glorified then remembered they that these things were written of him and that they had done these things unto him
the people therefore that was with him when he called lazarus out of his grave and raised him from the dead bare record
for this cause the people also met him for that they heard that he had done this miracle
the pharisees therefore said among themselves perceive ye how ye prevail nothing behold the world is gone after him
and there were certain greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast
the same came therefore to philip which was of bethsaida of galilee and desired him saying sir we would see jesus
philip cometh and telleth andrew and again andrew and philip tell jesus
and jesus answered them saying the hour is come that the son of man should be glorified
verily verily i say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit
he that loveth his life shall lose it and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal
if any man serve me let him follow me and where i am there shall also my servant be if any man serve me him will my father honour
now is my soul troubled and what shall i say father save me from this hour but for this cause came i unto this hour
father glorify thy name then came there a voice from heaven saying i have both glorified it and will glorify it again
the people therefore that stood by and heard it said that it thundered others said an angel spake to him
jesus answered and said this voice came not because of me but for your sakes
now is the judgment of this world now shall the prince of this world be cast out
and i if i be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto me
this he said signifying what death he should die
the people answered him we have heard out of the law that christ abideth for ever and how sayest thou the son of man must be lifted up who is this son of man
then jesus said unto them yet a little while is the light with you walk while ye have the light lest darkness come upon you for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth
while ye have light believe in the light that ye may be the children of light these things spake jesus and departed and did hide himself from them
but though he had done so many miracles before them yet they believed not on him
that the saying of esaias the prophet might be fulfilled which he spake lord who hath believed our report and to whom hath the arm of the lord been revealed
therefore they could not believe because that esaias said again
he hath blinded their eyes and hardened their heart that they should not see with their eyes nor understand with their heart and be converted and i should heal them
these things said esaias when he saw his glory and spake of him
nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him but because of the pharisees they did not confess him lest they should be put out of the synagogue
for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of god
jesus cried and said he that believeth on me believeth not on me but on him that sent me
and he that seeth me seeth him that sent me
i am come a light into the world that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness
and if any man hear my words and believe not i judge him not for i came not to judge the world but to save the world
he that rejecteth me and receiveth not my words hath one that judgeth him the word that i have spoken the same shall judge him in the last day
for i have not spoken of myself but the father which sent me he gave me a commandment what i should say and what i should speak
and i know that his commandment is life everlasting whatsoever i speak therefore even as the father said unto me so i speak
now before the feast of the passover when jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the end
and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of judas iscariot simons son to betray him
jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from god and went to god
he riseth from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself
after that he poureth water into a bason and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded
then cometh he to simon peter and peter saith unto him lord dost thou wash my feet
jesus answered and said unto him what i do thou knowest not now but thou shalt know hereafter
peter saith unto him thou shalt never wash my feet jesus answered him if i wash thee not thou hast no part with me
simon peter saith unto him lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head
jesus saith to him he that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet but is clean every whit and ye are clean but not all
for he knew who should betray him therefore said he ye are not all clean
so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them know ye what i have done to you
ye call me master and lord and ye say well for so i am
if i then your lord and master have washed your feet ye also ought to wash one anothers feet
for i have given you an example that ye should do as i have done to you
verily verily i say unto you the servant is not greater than his lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him
if ye know these things happy are ye if ye do them
i speak not of you all i know whom i have chosen but that the scripture may be fulfilled he that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me
now i tell you before it come that when it is come to pass ye may believe that i am he
verily verily i say unto you he that receiveth whomsoever i send receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me
when jesus had thus said he was troubled in spirit and testified and said verily verily i say unto you that one of you shall betray me
then the disciples looked one on another doubting of whom he spake
now there was leaning on jesus bosom one of his disciples whom jesus loved
simon peter therefore beckoned to him that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake
he then lying on jesus breast saith unto him lord who is it
jesus answered he it is to whom i shall give a sop when i have dipped it and when he had dipped the sop he gave it to judas iscariot the son of simon
and after the sop satan entered into him then said jesus unto him that thou doest do quickly
now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him
for some of them thought because judas had the bag that jesus had said unto him buy those things that we have need of against the feast or that he should give something to the poor
he then having received the sop went immediately out and it was night
therefore when he was gone out jesus said now is the son of man glorified and god is glorified in him
if god be glorified in him god shall also glorify him in himself and shall straightway glorify him
little children yet a little while i am with you ye shall seek me and as i said unto the jews whither i go ye cannot come so now i say to you
a new commandment i give unto you that ye love one another as i have loved you that ye also love one another
by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if ye have love one to another
simon peter said unto him lord whither goest thou jesus answered him whither i go thou canst not follow me now but thou shalt follow me afterwards
peter said unto him lord why cannot i follow thee now i will lay down my life for thy sake
jesus answered him wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake verily verily i say unto thee the cock shall not crow till thou hast denied me thrice
let not your heart be troubled ye believe in god believe also in me
in my fathers house are many mansions if it were not so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you
and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am there ye may be also
and whither i go ye know and the way ye know
thomas saith unto him lord we know not whither thou goest and how can we know the way
jesus saith unto him i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
if ye had known me ye should have known my father also and from henceforth ye know him and have seen him
philip saith unto him lord shew us the father and it sufficeth us
jesus saith unto him have i been so long time with you and yet hast thou not known me philip he that hath seen me hath seen the father and how sayest thou then shew us the father
believest thou not that i am in the father and the father in me the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works
believe me that i am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very works sake
verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because i go unto my father
and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will i do that the father may be glorified in the son
if ye shall ask any thing in my name i will do it
if ye love me keep my commandments
and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you for ever
even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you
i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you
yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because i live ye shall live also
at that day ye shall know that i am in my father and ye in me and i in you
he that hath my commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and i will love him and will manifest myself to him
judas saith unto him not iscariot lord how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us and not unto the world
jesus answered and said unto him if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him
he that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings and the word which ye hear is not mine but the fathers which sent me
these things have i spoken unto you being yet present with you
but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you
peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth give i unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid
ye have heard how i said unto you i go away and come again unto you if ye loved me ye would rejoice because i said i go unto the father for my father is greater than i
and now i have told you before it come to pass that when it is come to pass ye might believe
hereafter i will not talk much with you for the prince of this world cometh and hath nothing in me
but that the world may know that i love the father and as the father gave me commandment even so i do arise let us go hence
i am the true vine and my father is the husbandman
every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit
now ye are clean through the word which i have spoken unto you
abide in me and i in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except ye abide in me
i am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing
if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned
if ye abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what ye will and it shall be done unto you
herein is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples
as the father hath loved me so have i loved you continue ye in my love
if ye keep my commandments ye shall abide in my love even as i have kept my fathers commandments and abide in his love
these things have i spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full
this is my commandment that ye love one another as i have loved you
greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends
ye are my friends if ye do whatsoever i command you
henceforth i call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth but i have called you friends for all things that i have heard of my father i have made known unto you
ye have not chosen me but i have chosen you and ordained you that ye should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in my name he may give it you
these things i command you that ye love one another
if the world hate you ye know that it hated me before it hated you
if ye were of the world the world would love his own but because ye are not of the world but i have chosen you out of the world therefore the world hateth you
remember the word that i said unto you the servant is not greater than his lord if they have persecuted me they will also persecute you if they have kept my saying they will keep yours also
but all these things will they do unto you for my names sake because they know not him that sent me
if i had not come and spoken unto them they had not had sin but now they have no cloak for their sin
he that hateth me hateth my father also
if i had not done among them the works which none other man did they had not had sin but now have they both seen and hated both me and my father
but this cometh to pass that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law they hated me without a cause
but when the comforter is come whom i will send unto you from the father even the spirit of truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me
and ye also shall bear witness because ye have been with me from the beginning
these things have i spoken unto you that ye should not be offended
they shall put you out of the synagogues yea the time cometh that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth god service
and these things will they do unto you because they have not known the father nor me
but these things have i told you that when the time shall come ye may remember that i told you of them and these things i said not unto you at the beginning because i was with you
but now i go my way to him that sent me and none of you asketh me whither goest thou
but because i have said these things unto you sorrow hath filled your heart
nevertheless i tell you the truth it is expedient for you that i go away for if i go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if i depart i will send him unto you
and when he is come he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment
of sin because they believe not on me
of righteousness because i go to my father and ye see me no more
of judgment because the prince of this world is judged
i have yet many things to say unto you but ye cannot bear them now
howbeit when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will shew you things to come
he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall shew it unto you
all things that the father hath are mine therefore said i that he shall take of mine and shall shew it unto you
a little while and ye shall not see me and again a little while and ye shall see me because i go to the father
then said some of his disciples among themselves what is this that he saith unto us a little while and ye shall not see me and again a little while and ye shall see me and because i go to the father
they said therefore what is this that he saith a little while we cannot tell what he saith
now jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him and said unto them do ye enquire among yourselves of that i said a little while and ye shall not see me and again a little while and ye shall see me
verily verily i say unto you that ye shall weep and lament but the world shall rejoice and ye shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turned into joy
a woman when she is in travail hath sorrow because her hour is come but as soon as she is delivered of the child she remembereth no more the anguish for joy that a man is born into the world
and ye now therefore have sorrow but i will see you again and your heart shall rejoice and your joy no man taketh from you
and in that day ye shall ask me nothing verily verily i say unto you whatsoever ye shall ask the father in my name he will give it you
hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name ask and ye shall receive that your joy may be full
these things have i spoken unto you in proverbs but the time cometh when i shall no more speak unto you in proverbs but i shall shew you plainly of the father
at that day ye shall ask in my name and i say not unto you that i will pray the father for you
for the father himself loveth you because ye have loved me and have believed that i came out from god
i came forth from the father and am come into the world again i leave the world and go to the father
his disciples said unto him lo now speakest thou plainly and speakest no proverb
now are we sure that thou knowest all things and needest not that any man should ask thee by this we believe that thou camest forth from god
jesus answered them do ye now believe
behold the hour cometh yea is now come that ye shall be scattered every man to his own and shall leave me alone and yet i am not alone because the father is with me
these things i have spoken unto you that in me ye might have peace in the world ye shall have tribulation but be of good cheer i have overcome the world
these words spake jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour is come glorify thy son that thy son also may glorify thee
as thou hast given him power over all flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him
and this is life eternal that they might know thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou hast sent
i have glorified thee on the earth i have finished the work which thou gavest me to do
and now o father glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which i had with thee before the world was
i have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world thine they were and thou gavest them me and they have kept thy word
now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee
for i have given unto them the words which thou gavest me and they have received them and have known surely that i came out from thee and they have believed that thou didst send me
i pray for them i pray not for the world but for them which thou hast given me for they are thine
and all mine are thine and thine are mine and i am glorified in them
and now i am no more in the world but these are in the world and i come to thee holy father keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me that they may be one as we are
while i was with them in the world i kept them in thy name those that thou gavest me i have kept and none of them is lost but the son of perdition that the scripture might be fulfilled
and now come i to thee and these things i speak in the world that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves
i have given them thy word and the world hath hated them because they are not of the world even as i am not of the world
i pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil
they are not of the world even as i am not of the world
sanctify them through thy truth thy word is truth
as thou hast sent me into the world even so have i also sent them into the world
and for their sakes i sanctify myself that they also might be sanctified through the truth
neither pray i for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word
that they all may be one as thou father art in me and i in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou hast sent me
and the glory which thou gavest me i have given them that they may be one even as we are one
i in them and thou in me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou hast sent me and hast loved them as thou hast loved me
father i will that they also whom thou hast given me be with me where i am that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world
o righteous father the world hath not known thee but i have known thee and these have known that thou hast sent me
and i have declared unto them thy name and will declare it that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them and i in them
when jesus had spoken these words he went forth with his disciples over the brook cedron where was a garden into the which he entered and his disciples
and judas also which betrayed him knew the place for jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples
judas then having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and pharisees cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons
jesus therefore knowing all things that should come upon him went forth and said unto them whom seek ye
they answered him jesus of nazareth jesus saith unto them i am he and judas also which betrayed him stood with them
as soon then as he had said unto them i am he they went backward and fell to the ground
then asked he them again whom seek ye and they said jesus of nazareth
jesus answered i have told you that i am he if therefore ye seek me let these go their way
that the saying might be fulfilled which he spake of them which thou gavest me have i lost none
then simon peter having a sword drew it and smote the high priests servant and cut off his right ear the servants name was malchus
then said jesus unto peter put up thy sword into the sheath the cup which my father hath given me shall i not drink it
then the band and the captain and officers of the jews took jesus and bound him
and led him away to annas first for he was father in law to caiaphas which was the high priest that same year
now caiaphas was he which gave counsel to the jews that it was expedient that one man should die for the people
and simon peter followed jesus and so did another disciple that disciple was known unto the high priest and went in with jesus into the palace of the high priest
but peter stood at the door without then went out that other disciple which was known unto the high priest and spake unto her that kept the door and brought in peter
then saith the damsel that kept the door unto peter art not thou also one of this mans disciples he saith i am not
and the servants and officers stood there who had made a fire of coals for it was cold and they warmed themselves and peter stood with them and warmed himself
the high priest then asked jesus of his disciples and of his doctrine
jesus answered him i spake openly to the world i ever taught in the synagogue and in the temple whither the jews always resort and in secret have i said nothing
why askest thou me ask them which heard me what i have said unto them behold they know what i said
and when he had thus spoken one of the officers which stood by struck jesus with the palm of his hand saying answerest thou the high priest so
jesus answered him if i have spoken evil bear witness of the evil but if well why smitest thou me
now annas had sent him bound unto caiaphas the high priest
and simon peter stood and warmed himself they said therefore unto him art not thou also one of his disciples he denied it and said i am not
one of the servants of the high priest being his kinsman whose ear peter cut off saith did not i see thee in the garden with him
peter then denied again and immediately the cock crew
then led they jesus from caiaphas unto the hall of judgment and it was early and they themselves went not into the judgment hall lest they should be defiled but that they might eat the passover
pilate then went out unto them and said what accusation bring ye against this man
they answered and said unto him if he were not a malefactor we would not have delivered him up unto thee
then said pilate unto them take ye him and judge him according to your law the jews therefore said unto him it is not lawful for us to put any man to death
that the saying of jesus might be fulfilled which he spake signifying what death he should die
then pilate entered into the judgment hall again and called jesus and said unto him art thou the king of the jews
jesus answered him sayest thou this thing of thyself or did others tell it thee of me
pilate answered am i a jew thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me what hast thou done
jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that i should not be delivered to the jews but now is my kingdom not from hence
pilate therefore said unto him art thou a king then jesus answered thou sayest that i am a king to this end was i born and for this cause came i into the world that i should bear witness unto the truth every one that is of the truth heareth my voice
pilate saith unto him what is truth and when he had said this he went out again unto the jews and saith unto them i find in him no fault at all
but ye have a custom that i should release unto you one at the passover will ye therefore that i release unto you the king of the jews
then cried they all again saying not this man but barabbas now barabbas was a robber
then pilate therefore took jesus and scourged him
and the soldiers platted a crown of thorns and put it on his head and they put on him a purple robe
and said hail king of the jews and they smote him with their hands
pilate therefore went forth again and saith unto them behold i bring him forth to you that ye may know that i find no fault in him
then came jesus forth wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe and pilate saith unto them behold the man
when the chief priests therefore and officers saw him they cried out saying crucify him crucify him pilate saith unto them take ye him and crucify him for i find no fault in him
the jews answered him we have a law and by our law he ought to die because he made himself the son of god
when pilate therefore heard that saying he was the more afraid
and went again into the judgment hall and saith unto jesus whence art thou but jesus gave him no answer
then saith pilate unto him speakest thou not unto me knowest thou not that i have power to crucify thee and have power to release thee
jesus answered thou couldest have no power at all against me except it were given thee from above therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin
and from thenceforth pilate sought to release him but the jews cried out saying if thou let this man go thou art not caesars friend whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against caesar
when pilate therefore heard that saying he brought jesus forth and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the pavement but in the hebrew gabbatha
and it was the preparation of the passover and about the sixth hour and he saith unto the jews behold your king
but they cried out away with him away with him crucify him pilate saith unto them shall i crucify your king the chief priests answered we have no king but caesar
then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified and they took jesus and led him away
and he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull which is called in the hebrew golgotha
where they crucified him and two other with him on either side one and jesus in the midst
and pilate wrote a title and put it on the cross and the writing was jesus of nazareth the king of the jews
this title then read many of the jews for the place where jesus was crucified was nigh to the city and it was written in hebrew and greek and latin
then said the chief priests of the jews to pilate write not the king of the jews but that he said i am king of the jews
pilate answered what i have written i have written
then the soldiers when they had crucified jesus took his garments and made four parts to every soldier a part and also his coat now the coat was without seam woven from the top throughout
they said therefore among themselves let us not rend it but cast lots for it whose it shall be that the scripture might be fulfilled which saith they parted my raiment among them and for my vesture they did cast lots these things therefore the soldiers did
now there stood by the cross of jesus his mother and his mothers sister mary the wife of cleophas and mary magdalene
when jesus therefore saw his mother and the disciple standing by whom he loved he saith unto his mother woman behold thy son
then saith he to the disciple behold thy mother and from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home
after this jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished that the scripture might be fulfilled saith i thirst
now there was set a vessel full of vinegar and they filled a spunge with vinegar and put it upon hyssop and put it to his mouth
when jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost
the jews therefore because it was the preparation that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day for that sabbath day was an high day besought pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away
then came the soldiers and brake the legs of the first and of the other which was crucified with him
but when they came to jesus and saw that he was dead already they brake not his legs
but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side and forthwith came there out blood and water
and he that saw it bare record and his record is true and he knoweth that he saith true that ye might believe
for these things were done that the scripture should be fulfilled a bone of him shall not be broken
and again another scripture saith they shall look on him whom they pierced
and after this joseph of arimathaea being a disciple of jesus but secretly for fear of the jews besought pilate that he might take away the body of jesus and pilate gave him leave he came therefore and took the body of jesus
and there came also nicodemus which at the first came to jesus by night and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes about an hundred pound weight
then took they the body of jesus and wound it in linen clothes with the spices as the manner of the jews is to bury
now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden and in the garden a new sepulchre wherein was never man yet laid
there laid they jesus therefore because of the jews preparation day for the sepulchre was nigh at hand
the first day of the week cometh mary magdalene early when it was yet dark unto the sepulchre and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre
then she runneth and cometh to simon peter and to the other disciple whom jesus loved and saith unto them they have taken away the lord out of the sepulchre and we know not where they have laid him
peter therefore went forth and that other disciple and came to the sepulchre
so they ran both together and the other disciple did outrun peter and came first to the sepulchre
and he stooping down and looking in saw the linen clothes lying yet went he not in
then cometh simon peter following him and went into the sepulchre and seeth the linen clothes lie
and the napkin that was about his head not lying with the linen clothes but wrapped together in a place by itself
then went in also that other disciple which came first to the sepulchre and he saw and believed
for as yet they knew not the scripture that he must rise again from the dead
then the disciples went away again unto their own home
but mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping and as she wept she stooped down and looked into the sepulchre
and seeth two angels in white sitting the one at the head and the other at the feet where the body of jesus had lain
and they say unto her woman why weepest thou she saith unto them because they have taken away my lord and i know not where they have laid him
and when she had thus said she turned herself back and saw jesus standing and knew not that it was jesus
jesus saith unto her woman why weepest thou whom seekest thou she supposing him to be the gardener saith unto him sir if thou have borne him hence tell me where thou hast laid him and i will take him away
jesus saith unto her mary she turned herself and saith unto him rabboni which is to say master
jesus saith unto her touch me not for i am not yet ascended to my father but go to my brethren and say unto them i ascend unto my father and your father and to my god and your god
mary magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the lord and that he had spoken these things unto her
then the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the jews came jesus and stood in the midst and saith unto them peace be unto you
and when he had so said he shewed unto them his hands and his side then were the disciples glad when they saw the lord
then said jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father hath sent me even so send i you
and when he had said this he breathed on them and saith unto them receive ye the holy ghost
whose soever sins ye remit they are remitted unto them and whose soever sins ye retain they are retained
but thomas one of the twelve called didymus was not with them when jesus came
the other disciples therefore said unto him we have seen the lord but he said unto them except i shall see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and thrust my hand into his side i will not believe
and after eight days again his disciples were within and thomas with them then came jesus the doors being shut and stood in the midst and said peace be unto you
then saith he to thomas reach hither thy finger and behold my hands and reach hither thy hand and thrust it into my side and be not faithless but believing
and thomas answered and said unto him my lord and my god
jesus saith unto him thomas because thou hast seen me thou hast believed blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed
and many other signs truly did jesus in the presence of his disciples which are not written in this book
but these are written that ye might believe that jesus is the christ the son of god and that believing ye might have life through his name
after these things jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of tiberias and on this wise shewed he himself
there were together simon peter and thomas called didymus and nathanael of cana in galilee and the sons of zebedee and two other of his disciples
simon peter saith unto them i go a fishing they say unto him we also go with thee they went forth and entered into a ship immediately and that night they caught nothing
but when the morning was now come jesus stood on the shore but the disciples knew not that it was jesus
then jesus saith unto them children have ye any meat they answered him no
and he said unto them cast the net on the right side of the ship and ye shall find they cast therefore and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes
therefore that disciple whom jesus loved saith unto peter it is the lord now when simon peter heard that it was the lord he girt his fishers coat unto him for he was naked and did cast himself into the sea
and the other disciples came in a little ship for they were not far from land but as it were two hundred cubits dragging the net with fishes
as soon then as they were come to land they saw a fire of coals there and fish laid thereon and bread
jesus saith unto them bring of the fish which ye have now caught
simon peter went up and drew the net to land full of great fishes an hundred and fifty and three and for all there were so many yet was not the net broken
jesus saith unto them come and dine and none of the disciples durst ask him who art thou knowing that it was the lord
jesus then cometh and taketh bread and giveth them and fish likewise
this is now the third time that jesus shewed himself to his disciples after that he was risen from the dead
so when they had dined jesus saith to simon peter simon son of jonas lovest thou me more than these he saith unto him yea lord thou knowest that i love thee he saith unto him feed my lambs
he saith to him again the second time simon son of jonas lovest thou me he saith unto him yea lord thou knowest that i love thee he saith unto him feed my sheep
he saith unto him the third time simon son of jonas lovest thou me peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time lovest thou me and he said unto him lord thou knowest all things thou knowest that i love thee jesus saith unto him feed my sheep
verily verily i say unto thee when thou wast young thou girdest thyself and walkedst whither thou wouldest but when thou shalt be old thou shalt stretch forth thy hands and another shall gird thee and carry thee whither thou wouldest not
this spake he signifying by what death he should glorify god and when he had spoken this he saith unto him follow me
then peter turning about seeth the disciple whom jesus loved following which also leaned on his breast at supper and said lord which is he that betrayeth thee
peter seeing him saith to jesus lord and what shall this man do
jesus saith unto him if i will that he tarry till i come what is that to thee follow thou me
then went this saying abroad among the brethren that that disciple should not die yet jesus said not unto him he shall not die but if i will that he tarry till i come what is that to thee
this is the disciple which testifieth of these things and wrote these things and we know that his testimony is true
and there are also many other things which jesus did the which if they should be written every one i suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written amen
the former treatise have i made o theophilus of all that jesus began both to do and teach
until the day in which he was taken up after that he through the holy ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen
to whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs being seen of them forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of god
and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father which saith he ye have heard of me
for john truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence
when they therefore were come together they asked of him saying lord wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to israel
and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father hath put in his own power
but ye shall receive power after that the holy ghost is come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and in all judaea and in samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth
and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight
and while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel
which also said ye men of galilee why stand ye gazing up into heaven this same jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven
then returned they unto jerusalem from the mount called olivet which is from jerusalem a sabbath days journey
and when they were come in they went up into an upper room where abode both peter and james and john and andrew philip and thomas bartholomew and matthew james the son of alphaeus and simon zelotes and judas the brother of james
these all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication with the women and mary the mother of jesus and with his brethren
and in those days peter stood up in the midst of the disciples and said the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty
men and brethren this scripture must needs have been fulfilled which the holy ghost by the mouth of david spake before concerning judas which was guide to them that took jesus
for he was numbered with us and had obtained part of this ministry
now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity and falling headlong he burst asunder in the midst and all his bowels gushed out
and it was known unto all the dwellers at jerusalem insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue aceldama that is to say the field of blood
for it is written in the book of psalms let his habitation be desolate and let no man dwell therein and his bishoprick let another take
wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the lord jesus went in and out among us
beginning from the baptism of john unto that same day that he was taken up from us must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection
and they appointed two joseph called barsabas who was surnamed justus and matthias
and they prayed and said thou lord which knowest the hearts of all men shew whether of these two thou hast chosen
that he may take part of this ministry and apostleship from which judas by transgression fell that he might go to his own place
and they gave forth their lots and the lot fell upon matthias and he was numbered with the eleven apostles
and when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all with one accord in one place
and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting
and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each of them
and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance
and there were dwelling at jerusalem jews devout men out of every nation under heaven
now when this was noised abroad the multitude came together and were confounded because that every man heard them speak in his own language
and they were all amazed and marvelled saying one to another behold are not all these which speak galilaeans
and how hear we every man in our own tongue wherein we were born
parthians and medes and elamites and the dwellers in mesopotamia and in judaea and cappadocia in pontus and asia
phrygia and pamphylia in egypt and in the parts of libya about cyrene and strangers of rome jews and proselytes
cretes and arabians we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of god
and they were all amazed and were in doubt saying one to another what meaneth this
others mocking said these men are full of new wine
but peter standing up with the eleven lifted up his voice and said unto them ye men of judaea and all ye that dwell at jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words
for these are not drunken as ye suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day
but this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel
and it shall come to pass in the last days saith god i will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams
and on my servants and on my handmaidens i will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy
and i will shew wonders in heaven above and signs in the earth beneath blood and fire and vapour of smoke
the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and notable day of the lord come
and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved
ye men of israel hear these words jesus of nazareth a man approved of god among you by miracles and wonders and signs which god did by him in the midst of you as ye yourselves also know
him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of god ye have taken and by wicked hands have crucified and slain
whom god hath raised up having loosed the pains of death because it was not possible that he should be holden of it
for david speaketh concerning him i foresaw the lord always before my face for he is on my right hand that i should not be moved
therefore did my heart rejoice and my tongue was glad moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope
because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption
thou hast made known to me the ways of life thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance
men and brethren let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch david that he is both dead and buried and his sepulchre is with us unto this day
therefore being a prophet and knowing that god had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his loins according to the flesh he would raise up christ to sit on his throne
he seeing this before spake of the resurrection of christ that his soul was not left in hell neither his flesh did see corruption
this jesus hath god raised up whereof we all are witnesses
therefore being by the right hand of god exalted and having received of the father the promise of the holy ghost he hath shed forth this which ye now see and hear
for david is not ascended into the heavens but he saith himself the lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand
until i make thy foes thy footstool
therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly that god hath made the same jesus whom ye have crucified both lord and christ
now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and to the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do
then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are afar off even as many as the lord our god shall call
and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this untoward generation
then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls
and they continued stedfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship and in breaking of bread and in prayers
and fear came upon every soul and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles
and all that believed were together and had all things common
and sold their possessions and goods and parted them to all men as every man had need
and they continuing daily with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart
praising god and having favour with all the people and the lord added to the church daily such as should be saved
now peter and john went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer being the ninth hour
and a certain man lame from his mothers womb was carried whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called beautiful to ask alms of them that entered into the temple
who seeing peter and john about to go into the temple asked an alms
and peter fastening his eyes upon him with john said look on us
and he gave heed unto them expecting to receive something of them
then peter said silver and gold have i none but such as i have give i thee in the name of jesus christ of nazareth rise up and walk
and he took him by the right hand and lifted him up and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength
and he leaping up stood and walked and entered with them into the temple walking and leaping and praising god
and all the people saw him walking and praising god
and they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the beautiful gate of the temple and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him
and as the lame man which was healed held peter and john all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called solomons greatly wondering
and when peter saw it he answered unto the people ye men of israel why marvel ye at this or why look ye so earnestly on us as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk
the god of abraham and of isaac and of jacob the god of our fathers hath glorified his son jesus whom ye delivered up and denied him in the presence of pilate when he was determined to let him go
but ye denied the holy one and the just and desired a murderer to be granted unto you
and killed the prince of life whom god hath raised from the dead whereof we are witnesses
and his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong whom ye see and know yea the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all
and now brethren i wot that through ignorance ye did it as did also your rulers
but those things which god before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets that christ should suffer he hath so fulfilled
repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the lord
and he shall send jesus christ which before was preached unto you
whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things which god hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began
for moses truly said unto the fathers a prophet shall the lord your god raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you
and it shall come to pass that every soul which will not hear that prophet shall be destroyed from among the people
yea and all the prophets from samuel and those that follow after as many as have spoken have likewise foretold of these days
ye are the children of the prophets and of the covenant which god made with our fathers saying unto abraham and in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed
unto you first god having raised up his son jesus sent him to bless you in turning away every one of you from his iniquities
and as they spake unto the people the priests and the captain of the temple and the sadducees came upon them
being grieved that they taught the people and preached through jesus the resurrection from the dead
and they laid hands on them and put them in hold unto the next day for it was now eventide
howbeit many of them which heard the word believed and the number of the men was about five thousand
and it came to pass on the morrow that their rulers and elders and scribes
and annas the high priest and caiaphas and john and alexander and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest were gathered together at jerusalem
and when they had set them in the midst they asked by what power or by what name have ye done this
then peter filled with the holy ghost said unto them ye rulers of the people and elders of israel
if we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man by what means he is made whole
be it known unto you all and to all the people of israel that by the name of jesus christ of nazareth whom ye crucified whom god raised from the dead even by him doth this man stand here before you whole
this is the stone which was set at nought of you builders which is become the head of the corner
neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved
now when they saw the boldness of peter and john and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men they marvelled and they took knowledge of them that they had been with jesus
and beholding the man which was healed standing with them they could say nothing against it
but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council they conferred among themselves
saying what shall we do to these men for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in jerusalem and we cannot deny it
but that it spread no further among the people let us straitly threaten them that they speak henceforth to no man in this name
and they called them and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of jesus
but peter and john answered and said unto them whether it be right in the sight of god to hearken unto you more than unto god judge ye
for we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard
so when they had further threatened them they let them go finding nothing how they might punish them because of the people for all men glorified god for that which was done
for the man was above forty years old on whom this miracle of healing was shewed
and being let go they went to their own company and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them
and when they heard that they lifted up their voice to god with one accord and said lord thou art god which hast made heaven and earth and the sea and all that in them is
who by the mouth of thy servant david hast said why did the heathen rage and the people imagine vain things
the kings of the earth stood up and the rulers were gathered together against the lord and against his christ
for of a truth against thy holy child jesus whom thou hast anointed both herod and pontius pilate with the gentiles and the people of israel were gathered together
for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done
and now lord behold their threatenings and grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they may speak thy word
by stretching forth thine hand to heal and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child jesus
and when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the holy ghost and they spake the word of god with boldness
and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own but they had all things common
and with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the lord jesus and great grace was upon them all
neither was there any among them that lacked for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them and brought the prices of the things that were sold
and laid them down at the apostles feet and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need
and joses who by the apostles was surnamed barnabas which is being interpreted the son of consolation a levite and of the country of cyprus
having land sold it and brought the money and laid it at the apostles feet
but a certain man named ananias with sapphira his wife sold a possession
and kept back part of the price his wife also being privy to it and brought a certain part and laid it at the apostles feet
but peter said ananias why hath satan filled thine heart to lie to the holy ghost and to keep back part of the price of the land
whiles it remained was it not thine own and after it was sold was it not in thine own power why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart thou hast not lied unto men but unto god
and ananias hearing these words fell down and gave up the ghost and great fear came on all them that heard these things
and the young men arose wound him up and carried him out and buried him
and it was about the space of three hours after when his wife not knowing what was done came in
and peter answered unto her tell me whether ye sold the land for so much and she said yea for so much
then peter said unto her how is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the spirit of the lord behold the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door and shall carry thee out
then fell she down straightway at his feet and yielded up the ghost and the young men came in and found her dead and carrying her forth buried her by her husband
and great fear came upon all the church and upon as many as heard these things
and by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people and they were all with one accord in solomons porch
and of the rest durst no man join himself to them but the people magnified them
and believers were the more added to the lord multitudes both of men and women
insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and couches that at the least the shadow of peter passing by might overshadow some of them
there came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto jerusalem bringing sick folks and them which were vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed every one
then the high priest rose up and all they that were with him which is the sect of the sadducees and were filled with indignation
and laid their hands on the apostles and put them in the common prison
but the angel of the lord by night opened the prison doors and brought them forth and said
go stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life
and when they heard that they entered into the temple early in the morning and taught but the high priest came and they that were with him and called the council together and all the senate of the children of israel and sent to the prison to have them brought
but when the officers came and found them not in the prison they returned and told
saying the prison truly found we shut with all safety and the keepers standing without before the doors but when we had opened we found no man within
now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things they doubted of them whereunto this would grow
then came one and told them saying behold the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people
then went the captain with the officers and brought them without violence for they feared the people lest they should have been stoned
and when they had brought them they set them before the council and the high priest asked them
saying did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name and behold ye have filled jerusalem with your doctrine and intend to bring this mans blood upon us
then peter and the other apostles answered and said we ought to obey god rather than men
the god of our fathers raised up jesus whom ye slew and hanged on a tree
him hath god exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a saviour for to give repentance to israel and forgiveness of sins
and we are his witnesses of these things and so is also the holy ghost whom god hath given to them that obey him
when they heard that they were cut to the heart and took counsel to slay them
then stood there up one in the council a pharisee named gamaliel a doctor of the law had in reputation among all the people and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space
and said unto them ye men of israel take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men
for before these days rose up theudas boasting himself to be somebody to whom a number of men about four hundred joined themselves who was slain and all as many as obeyed him were scattered and brought to nought
after this man rose up judas of galilee in the days of the taxing and drew away much people after him he also perished and all even as many as obeyed him were dispersed
and now i say unto you refrain from these men and let them alone for if this counsel or this work be of men it will come to nought
but if it be of god ye cannot overthrow it lest haply ye be found even to fight against god
and to him they agreed and when they had called the apostles and beaten them they commanded that they should not speak in the name of jesus and let them go
and they departed from the presence of the council rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name
and daily in the temple and in every house they ceased not to teach and preach jesus christ
and in those days when the number of the disciples was multiplied there arose a murmuring of the grecians against the hebrews because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration
then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them and said it is not reason that we should leave the word of god and serve tables
wherefore brethren look ye out among you seven men of honest report full of the holy ghost and wisdom whom we may appoint over this business
but we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the word
and the saying pleased the whole multitude and they chose stephen a man full of faith and of the holy ghost and philip and prochorus and nicanor and timon and parmenas and nicolas a proselyte of antioch
whom they set before the apostles and when they had prayed they laid their hands on them
and the word of god increased and the number of the disciples multiplied in jerusalem greatly and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith
and stephen full of faith and power did great wonders and miracles among the people
then there arose certain of the synagogue which is called the synagogue of the libertines and cyrenians and alexandrians and of them of cilicia and of asia disputing with stephen
and they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake
then they suborned men which said we have heard him speak blasphemous words against moses and against god
and they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes and came upon him and caught him and brought him to the council
and set up false witnesses which said this man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place and the law
for we have heard him say that this jesus of nazareth shall destroy this place and shall change the customs which moses delivered us
and all that sat in the council looking stedfastly on him saw his face as it had been the face of an angel
then said the high priest are these things so
and he said men brethren and fathers hearken the god of glory appeared unto our father abraham when he was in mesopotamia before he dwelt in charran
and said unto him get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and come into the land which i shall shew thee
then came he out of the land of the chaldaeans and dwelt in charran and from thence when his father was dead he removed him into this land wherein ye now dwell
and he gave him none inheritance in it no not so much as to set his foot on yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession and to his seed after him when as yet he had no child
and god spake on this wise that his seed should sojourn in a strange land and that they should bring them into bondage and entreat them evil four hundred years
and the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will i judge said god and after that shall they come forth and serve me in this place
and he gave him the covenant of circumcision and so abraham begat isaac and circumcised him the eighth day and isaac begat jacob and jacob begat the twelve patriarchs
and the patriarchs moved with envy sold joseph into egypt but god was with him
and delivered him out of all his afflictions and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of pharaoh king of egypt and he made him governor over egypt and all his house
now there came a dearth over all the land of egypt and chanaan and great affliction and our fathers found no sustenance
but when jacob heard that there was corn in egypt he sent out our fathers first
and at the second time joseph was made known to his brethren and josephs kindred was made known unto pharaoh
then sent joseph and called his father jacob to him and all his kindred threescore and fifteen souls
so jacob went down into egypt and died he and our fathers
and were carried over into sychem and laid in the sepulchre that abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of emmor the father of sychem
but when the time of the promise drew nigh which god had sworn to abraham the people grew and multiplied in egypt
till another king arose which knew not joseph
the same dealt subtilly with our kindred and evil entreated our fathers so that they cast out their young children to the end they might not live
in which time moses was born and was exceeding fair and nourished up in his fathers house three months
and when he was cast out pharaohs daughter took him up and nourished him for her own son
and moses was learned in all the wisdom of the egyptians and was mighty in words and in deeds
and when he was full forty years old it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of israel
and seeing one of them suffer wrong he defended him and avenged him that was oppressed and smote the egyptian
for he supposed his brethren would have understood how that god by his hand would deliver them but they understood not
and the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove and would have set them at one again saying sirs ye are brethren why do ye wrong one to another
but he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away saying who made thee a ruler and a judge over us
wilt thou kill me as thou diddest the egyptian yesterday
then fled moses at this saying and was a stranger in the land of madian where he begat two sons
and when forty years were expired there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount sina an angel of the lord in a flame of fire in a bush
when moses saw it he wondered at the sight and as he drew near to behold it the voice of the lord came unto him
saying i am the god of thy fathers the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob then moses trembled and durst not behold
then said the lord to him put off thy shoes from thy feet for the place where thou standest is holy ground
i have seen i have seen the affliction of my people which is in egypt and i have heard their groaning and am come down to deliver them and now come i will send thee into egypt
this moses whom they refused saying who made thee a ruler and a judge the same did god send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush
he brought them out after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of egypt and in the red sea and in the wilderness forty years
this is that moses which said unto the children of israel a prophet shall the lord your god raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me him shall ye hear
this is he that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount sina and with our fathers who received the lively oracles to give unto us
to whom our fathers would not obey but thrust him from them and in their hearts turned back again into egypt
saying unto aaron make us gods to go before us for as for this moses which brought us out of the land of egypt we wot not what is become of him
and they made a calf in those days and offered sacrifice unto the idol and rejoiced in the works of their own hands
then god turned and gave them up to worship the host of heaven as it is written in the book of the prophets o ye house of israel have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness
yea ye took up the tabernacle of moloch and the star of your god remphan figures which ye made to worship them and i will carry you away beyond babylon
our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness as he had appointed speaking unto moses that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen
which also our fathers that came after brought in with jesus into the possession of the gentiles whom god drave out before the face of our fathers unto the days of david
who found favour before god and desired to find a tabernacle for the god of jacob
but solomon built him an house
howbeit the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as saith the prophet
heaven is my throne and earth is my footstool what house will ye build me saith the lord or what is the place of my rest
hath not my hand made all these things
ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears ye do always resist the holy ghost as your fathers did so do ye
which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the just one of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers
who have received the law by the disposition of angels and have not kept it
when they heard these things they were cut to the heart and they gnashed on him with their teeth
but he being full of the holy ghost looked up stedfastly into heaven and saw the glory of god and jesus standing on the right hand of god
and said behold i see the heavens opened and the son of man standing on the right hand of god
then they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and ran upon him with one accord
and cast him out of the city and stoned him and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young mans feet whose name was saul
and they stoned stephen calling upon god and saying lord jesus receive my spirit
and he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice lord lay not this sin to their charge and when he had said this he fell asleep
and saul was consenting unto his death and at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at jerusalem and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of judaea and samaria except the apostles
and devout men carried stephen to his burial and made great lamentation over him
as for saul he made havock of the church entering into every house and haling men and women committed them to prison
therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word
then philip went down to the city of samaria and preached christ unto them
and the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which philip spake hearing and seeing the miracles which he did
for unclean spirits crying with loud voice came out of many that were possessed with them and many taken with palsies and that were lame were healed
and there was great joy in that city
but there was a certain man called simon which beforetime in the same city used sorcery and bewitched the people of samaria giving out that himself was some great one
to whom they all gave heed from the least to the greatest saying this man is the great power of god
and to him they had regard because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries
but when they believed philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of god and the name of jesus christ they were baptized both men and women
then simon himself believed also and when he was baptized he continued with philip and wondered beholding the miracles and signs which were done
now when the apostles which were at jerusalem heard that samaria had received the word of god they sent unto them peter and john
who when they were come down prayed for them that they might receive the holy ghost
for as yet he was fallen upon none of them only they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus
then laid they their hands on them and they received the holy ghost
and when simon saw that through laying on of the apostles hands the holy ghost was given he offered them money
saying give me also this power that on whomsoever i lay hands he may receive the holy ghost
but peter said unto him thy money perish with thee because thou hast thought that the gift of god may be purchased with money
thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter for thy heart is not right in the sight of god
repent therefore of this thy wickedness and pray god if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee
for i perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity
then answered simon and said pray ye to the lord for me that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me
and they when they had testified and preached the word of the lord returned to jerusalem and preached the gospel in many villages of the samaritans
and the angel of the lord spake unto philip saying arise and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from jerusalem unto gaza which is desert
and he arose and went and behold a man of ethiopia an eunuch of great authority under candace queen of the ethiopians who had the charge of all her treasure and had come to jerusalem for to worship
was returning and sitting in his chariot read esaias the prophet
then the spirit said unto philip go near and join thyself to this chariot
and philip ran thither to him and heard him read the prophet esaias and said understandest thou what thou readest
and he said how can i except some man should guide me and he desired philip that he would come up and sit with him
the place of the scripture which he read was this he was led as a sheep to the slaughter and like a lamb dumb before his shearer so opened he not his mouth
in his humiliation his judgment was taken away and who shall declare his generation for his life is taken from the earth
and the eunuch answered philip and said i pray thee of whom speaketh the prophet this of himself or of some other man
then philip opened his mouth and began at the same scripture and preached unto him jesus
and as they went on their way they came unto a certain water and the eunuch said see here is water what doth hinder me to be baptized
and philip said if thou believest with all thine heart thou mayest and he answered and said i believe that jesus christ is the son of god
and he commanded the chariot to stand still and they went down both into the water both philip and the eunuch and he baptized him
and when they were come up out of the water the spirit of the lord caught away philip that the eunuch saw him no more and he went on his way rejoicing
but philip was found at azotus and passing through he preached in all the cities till he came to caesarea
and saul yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the lord went unto the high priest
and desired of him letters to damascus to the synagogues that if he found any of this way whether they were men or women he might bring them bound unto jerusalem
and as he journeyed he came near damascus and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven
and he fell to the earth and heard a voice saying unto him saul saul why persecutest thou me
and he said who art thou lord and the lord said i am jesus whom thou persecutest it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks
and he trembling and astonished said lord what wilt thou have me to do and the lord said unto him arise and go into the city and it shall be told thee what thou must do
and the men which journeyed with him stood speechless hearing a voice but seeing no man
and saul arose from the earth and when his eyes were opened he saw no man but they led him by the hand and brought him into damascus
and he was three days without sight and neither did eat nor drink
and there was a certain disciple at damascus named ananias and to him said the lord in a vision ananias and he said behold i am here lord
and the lord said unto him arise and go into the street which is called straight and enquire in the house of judas for one called saul of tarsus for behold he prayeth
and hath seen in a vision a man named ananias coming in and putting his hand on him that he might receive his sight
then ananias answered lord i have heard by many of this man how much evil he hath done to thy saints at jerusalem
and here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name
but the lord said unto him go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me to bear my name before the gentiles and kings and the children of israel
for i will shew him how great things he must suffer for my names sake
and ananias went his way and entered into the house and putting his hands on him said brother saul the lord even jesus that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest hath sent me that thou mightest receive thy sight and be filled with the holy ghost
and immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales and he received sight forthwith and arose and was baptized
and when he had received meat he was strengthened then was saul certain days with the disciples which were at damascus
and straightway he preached christ in the synagogues that he is the son of god
but all that heard him were amazed and said is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in jerusalem and came hither for that intent that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests
but saul increased the more in strength and confounded the jews which dwelt at damascus proving that this is very christ
and after that many days were fulfilled the jews took counsel to kill him
but their laying await was known of saul and they watched the gates day and night to kill him
then the disciples took him by night and let him down by the wall in a basket
and when saul was come to jerusalem he assayed to join himself to the disciples but they were all afraid of him and believed not that he was a disciple
but barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles and declared unto them how he had seen the lord in the way and that he had spoken to him and how he had preached boldly at damascus in the name of jesus
and he was with them coming in and going out at jerusalem
and he spake boldly in the name of the lord jesus and disputed against the grecians but they went about to slay him
which when the brethren knew they brought him down to caesarea and sent him forth to tarsus
then had the churches rest throughout all judaea and galilee and samaria and were edified and walking in the fear of the lord and in the comfort of the holy ghost were multiplied
and it came to pass as peter passed throughout all quarters he came down also to the saints which dwelt at lydda
and there he found a certain man named aeneas which had kept his bed eight years and was sick of the palsy
and peter said unto him aeneas jesus christ maketh thee whole arise and make thy bed and he arose immediately
and all that dwelt at lydda and saron saw him and turned to the lord
now there was at joppa a certain disciple named tabitha which by interpretation is called dorcas this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did
and it came to pass in those days that she was sick and died whom when they had washed they laid her in an upper chamber
and forasmuch as lydda was nigh to joppa and the disciples had heard that peter was there they sent unto him two men desiring him that he would not delay to come to them
then peter arose and went with them when he was come they brought him into the upper chamber and all the widows stood by him weeping and shewing the coats and garments which dorcas made while she was with them
but peter put them all forth and kneeled down and prayed and turning him to the body said tabitha arise and she opened her eyes and when she saw peter she sat up
and he gave her his hand and lifted her up and when he had called the saints and widows presented her alive
and it was known throughout all joppa and many believed in the lord
and it came to pass that he tarried many days in joppa with one simon a tanner
there was a certain man in caesarea called cornelius a centurion of the band called the italian band
a devout man and one that feared god with all his house which gave much alms to the people and prayed to god alway
he saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of god coming in to him and saying unto him cornelius
and when he looked on him he was afraid and said what is it lord and he said unto him thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before god
and now send men to joppa and call for one simon whose surname is peter
he lodgeth with one simon a tanner whose house is by the sea side he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do
and when the angel which spake unto cornelius was departed he called two of his household servants and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually
and when he had declared all these things unto them he sent them to joppa
on the morrow as they went on their journey and drew nigh unto the city peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour
and he became very hungry and would have eaten but while they made ready he fell into a trance
and saw heaven opened and a certain vessel descending upon him as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners and let down to the earth
wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth and wild beasts and creeping things and fowls of the air
and there came a voice to him rise peter kill and eat
but peter said not so lord for i have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean
and the voice spake unto him again the second time what god hath cleansed that call not thou common
this was done thrice and the vessel was received up again into heaven
now while peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean behold the men which were sent from cornelius had made enquiry for simons house and stood before the gate
and called and asked whether simon which was surnamed peter were lodged there
while peter thought on the vision the spirit said unto him behold three men seek thee
arise therefore and get thee down and go with them doubting nothing for i have sent them
then peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from cornelius and said behold i am he whom ye seek what is the cause wherefore ye are come
and they said cornelius the centurion a just man and one that feareth god and of good report among all the nation of the jews was warned from god by an holy angel to send for thee into his house and to hear words of thee
then called he them in and lodged them and on the morrow peter went away with them and certain brethren from joppa accompanied him
and the morrow after they entered into caesarea and cornelius waited for them and he had called together his kinsmen and near friends
and as peter was coming in cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshipped him
but peter took him up saying stand up i myself also am a man
and as he talked with him he went in and found many that were come together
and he said unto them ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a jew to keep company or come unto one of another nation but god hath shewed me that i should not call any man common or unclean
therefore came i unto you without gainsaying as soon as i was sent for i ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me
and cornelius said four days ago i was fasting until this hour and at the ninth hour i prayed in my house and behold a man stood before me in bright clothing
and said cornelius thy prayer is heard and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of god
send therefore to joppa and call hither simon whose surname is peter he is lodged in the house of one simon a tanner by the sea side who when he cometh shall speak unto thee
immediately therefore i sent to thee and thou hast well done that thou art come now therefore are we all here present before god to hear all things that are commanded thee of god
then peter opened his mouth and said of a truth i perceive that god is no respecter of persons
but in every nation he that feareth him and worketh righteousness is accepted with him
the word which god sent unto the children of israel preaching peace by jesus christ he is lord of all
that word i say ye know which was published throughout all judaea and began from galilee after the baptism which john preached
how god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy ghost and with power who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil for god was with him
and we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the jews and in jerusalem whom they slew and hanged on a tree
him god raised up the third day and shewed him openly
not to all the people but unto witnesses chosen before god even to us who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead
and he commanded us to preach unto the people and to testify that it is he which was ordained of god to be the judge of quick and dead
to him give all the prophets witness that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins
while peter yet spake these words the holy ghost fell on all them which heard the word
and they of the circumcision which believed were astonished as many as came with peter because that on the gentiles also was poured out the gift of the holy ghost
for they heard them speak with tongues and magnify god then answered peter
can any man forbid water that these should not be baptized which have received the holy ghost as well as we
and he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the lord then prayed they him to tarry certain days
and the apostles and brethren that were in judaea heard that the gentiles had also received the word of god
and when peter was come up to jerusalem they that were of the circumcision contended with him
saying thou wentest in to men uncircumcised and didst eat with them
but peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning and expounded it by order unto them saying
i was in the city of joppa praying and in a trance i saw a vision a certain vessel descend as it had been a great sheet let down from heaven by four corners and it came even to me
upon the which when i had fastened mine eyes i considered and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth and wild beasts and creeping things and fowls of the air
and i heard a voice saying unto me arise peter slay and eat
but i said not so lord for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth
but the voice answered me again from heaven what god hath cleansed that call not thou common
and this was done three times and all were drawn up again into heaven
and behold immediately there were three men already come unto the house where i was sent from caesarea unto me
and the spirit bade me go with them nothing doubting moreover these six brethren accompanied me and we entered into the mans house
and he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house which stood and said unto him send men to joppa and call for simon whose surname is peter
who shall tell thee words whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved
and as i began to speak the holy ghost fell on them as on us at the beginning
then remembered i the word of the lord how that he said john indeed baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost
forasmuch then as god gave them the like gift as he did unto us who believed on the lord jesus christ what was i that i could withstand god
when they heard these things they held their peace and glorified god saying then hath god also to the gentiles granted repentance unto life
now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about stephen travelled as far as phenice and cyprus and antioch preaching the word to none but unto the jews only
and some of them were men of cyprus and cyrene which when they were come to antioch spake unto the grecians preaching the lord jesus
and the hand of the lord was with them and a great number believed and turned unto the lord
then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in jerusalem and they sent forth barnabas that he should go as far as antioch
who when he came and had seen the grace of god was glad and exhorted them all that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the lord
for he was a good man and full of the holy ghost and of faith and much people was added unto the lord
then departed barnabas to tarsus for to seek saul
and when he had found him he brought him unto antioch and it came to pass that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church and taught much people and the disciples were called christians first in antioch
and in these days came prophets from jerusalem unto antioch
and there stood up one of them named agabus and signified by the spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world which came to pass in the days of claudius caesar
then the disciples every man according to his ability determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in judaea
which also they did and sent it to the elders by the hands of barnabas and saul
now about that time herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church
and he killed james the brother of john with the sword
and because he saw it pleased the jews he proceeded further to take peter also then were the days of unleavened bread
and when he had apprehended him he put him in prison and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him intending after easter to bring him forth to the people
peter therefore was kept in prison but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto god for him
and when herod would have brought him forth the same night peter was sleeping between two soldiers bound with two chains and the keepers before the door kept the prison
and behold the angel of the lord came upon him and a light shined in the prison and he smote peter on the side and raised him up saying arise up quickly and his chains fell off from his hands
and the angel said unto him gird thyself and bind on thy sandals and so he did and he saith unto him cast thy garment about thee and follow me
and he went out and followed him and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel but thought he saw a vision
when they were past the first and the second ward they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city which opened to them of his own accord and they went out and passed on through one street and forthwith the angel departed from him
and when peter was come to himself he said now i know of a surety that the lord hath sent his angel and hath delivered me out of the hand of herod and from all the expectation of the people of the jews
and when he had considered the thing he came to the house of mary the mother of john whose surname was mark where many were gathered together praying
and as peter knocked at the door of the gate a damsel came to hearken named rhoda
and when she knew peters voice she opened not the gate for gladness but ran in and told how peter stood before the gate
and they said unto her thou art mad but she constantly affirmed that it was even so then said they it is his angel
but peter continued knocking and when they had opened the door and saw him they were astonished
but he beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace declared unto them how the lord had brought him out of the prison and he said go shew these things unto james and to the brethren and he departed and went into another place
now as soon as it was day there was no small stir among the soldiers what was become of peter
and when herod had sought for him and found him not he examined the keepers and commanded that they should be put to death and he went down from judaea to caesarea and there abode
and herod was highly displeased with them of tyre and sidon but they came with one accord to him and having made blastus the kings chamberlain their friend desired peace because their country was nourished by the kings country
and upon a set day herod arrayed in royal apparel sat upon his throne and made an oration unto them
and the people gave a shout saying it is the voice of a god and not of a man
and immediately the angel of the lord smote him because he gave not god the glory and he was eaten of worms and gave up the ghost
but the word of god grew and multiplied
and barnabas and saul returned from jerusalem when they had fulfilled their ministry and took with them john whose surname was mark
now there were in the church that was at antioch certain prophets and teachers as barnabas and simeon that was called niger and lucius of cyrene and manaen which had been brought up with herod the tetrarch and saul
as they ministered to the lord and fasted the holy ghost said separate me barnabas and saul for the work whereunto i have called them
and when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them they sent them away
so they being sent forth by the holy ghost departed unto seleucia and from thence they sailed to cyprus
and when they were at salamis they preached the word of god in the synagogues of the jews and they had also john to their minister
and when they had gone through the isle unto paphos they found a certain sorcerer a false prophet a jew whose name was barjesus
which was with the deputy of the country sergius paulus a prudent man who called for barnabas and saul and desired to hear the word of god
but elymas the sorcerer for so is his name by interpretation withstood them seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith
then saul who also is called paul filled with the holy ghost set his eyes on him
and said o full of all subtilty and all mischief thou child of the devil thou enemy of all righteousness wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the lord
and now behold the hand of the lord is upon thee and thou shalt be blind not seeing the sun for a season and immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand
then the deputy when he saw what was done believed being astonished at the doctrine of the lord
now when paul and his company loosed from paphos they came to perga in pamphylia and john departing from them returned to jerusalem
but when they departed from perga they came to antioch in pisidia and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and sat down
and after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them saying ye men and brethren if ye have any word of exhortation for the people say on
then paul stood up and beckoning with his hand said men of israel and ye that fear god give audience
the god of this people of israel chose our fathers and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of egypt and with an high arm brought he them out of it
and about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness
and when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of chanaan he divided their land to them by lot
and after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years until samuel the prophet
and afterward they desired a king and god gave unto them saul the son of cis a man of the tribe of benjamin by the space of forty years
and when he had removed him he raised up unto them david to be their king to whom also he gave their testimony and said i have found david the son of jesse a man after mine own heart which shall fulfil all my will
of this mans seed hath god according to his promise raised unto israel a saviour jesus
when john had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of israel
and as john fulfilled his course he said whom think ye that i am i am not he but behold there cometh one after me whose shoes of his feet i am not worthy to loose
men and brethren children of the stock of abraham and whosoever among you feareth god to you is the word of this salvation sent
for they that dwell at jerusalem and their rulers because they knew him not nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day they have fulfilled them in condemning him
and though they found no cause of death in him yet desired they pilate that he should be slain
and when they had fulfilled all that was written of him they took him down from the tree and laid him in a sepulchre
but god raised him from the dead
and he was seen many days of them which came up with him from galilee to jerusalem who are his witnesses unto the people
and we declare unto you glad tidings how that the promise which was made unto the fathers
god hath fulfilled the same unto us their children in that he hath raised up jesus again as it is also written in the second psalm thou art my son this day have i begotten thee
and as concerning that he raised him up from the dead now no more to return to corruption he said on this wise i will give you the sure mercies of david
wherefore he saith also in another psalm thou shalt not suffer thine holy one to see corruption
for david after he had served his own generation by the will of god fell on sleep and was laid unto his fathers and saw corruption
but he whom god raised again saw no corruption
be it known unto you therefore men and brethren that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins
and by him all that believe are justified from all things from which ye could not be justified by the law of moses
beware therefore lest that come upon you which is spoken of in the prophets
behold ye despisers and wonder and perish for i work a work in your days a work which ye shall in no wise believe though a man declare it unto you
and when the jews were gone out of the synagogue the gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath
now when the congregation was broken up many of the jews and religious proselytes followed paul and barnabas who speaking to them persuaded them to continue in the grace of god
and the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of god
but when the jews saw the multitudes they were filled with envy and spake against those things which were spoken by paul contradicting and blaspheming
then paul and barnabas waxed bold and said it was necessary that the word of god should first have been spoken to you but seeing ye put it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life lo we turn to the gentiles
for so hath the lord commanded us saying i have set thee to be a light of the gentiles that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth
and when the gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed
and the word of the lord was published throughout all the region
but the jews stirred up the devout and honourable women and the chief men of the city and raised persecution against paul and barnabas and expelled them out of their coasts
but they shook off the dust of their feet against them and came unto iconium
and the disciples were filled with joy and with the holy ghost
and it came to pass in iconium that they went both together into the synagogue of the jews and so spake that a great multitude both of the jews and also of the greeks believed
but the unbelieving jews stirred up the gentiles and made their minds evil affected against the brethren
long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the lord which gave testimony unto the word of his grace and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands
but the multitude of the city was divided and part held with the jews and part with the apostles
and when there was an assault made both of the gentiles and also of the jews with their rulers to use them despitefully and to stone them
they were ware of it and fled unto lystra and derbe cities of lycaonia and unto the region that lieth round about
and there they preached the gospel
and there sat a certain man at lystra impotent in his feet being a cripple from his mothers womb who never had walked
the same heard paul speak who stedfastly beholding him and perceiving that he had faith to be healed
said with a loud voice stand upright on thy feet and he leaped and walked
and when the people saw what paul had done they lifted up their voices saying in the speech of lycaonia the gods are come down to us in the likeness of men
and they called barnabas jupiter and paul mercurius because he was the chief speaker
then the priest of jupiter which was before their city brought oxen and garlands unto the gates and would have done sacrifice with the people
which when the apostles barnabas and paul heard of they rent their clothes and ran in among the people crying out
and saying sirs why do ye these things we also are men of like passions with you and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living god which made heaven and earth and the sea and all things that are therein
who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways
nevertheless he left not himself without witness in that he did good and gave us rain from heaven and fruitful seasons filling our hearts with food and gladness
and with these sayings scarce restrained they the people that they had not done sacrifice unto them
and there came thither certain jews from antioch and iconium who persuaded the people and having stoned paul drew him out of the city supposing he had been dead
howbeit as the disciples stood round about him he rose up and came into the city and the next day he departed with barnabas to derbe
and when they had preached the gospel to that city and had taught many they returned again to lystra and to iconium and antioch
confirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to continue in the faith and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of god
and when they had ordained them elders in every church and had prayed with fasting they commended them to the lord on whom they believed
and after they had passed throughout pisidia they came to pamphylia
and when they had preached the word in perga they went down into attalia
and thence sailed to antioch from whence they had been recommended to the grace of god for the work which they fulfilled
and when they were come and had gathered the church together they rehearsed all that god had done with them and how he had opened the door of faith unto the gentiles
and there they abode long time with the disciples
and certain men which came down from judaea taught the brethren and said except ye be circumcised after the manner of moses ye cannot be saved
when therefore paul and barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them they determined that paul and barnabas and certain other of them should go up to jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question
and being brought on their way by the church they passed through phenice and samaria declaring the conversion of the gentiles and they caused great joy unto all the brethren
and when they were come to jerusalem they were received of the church and of the apostles and elders and they declared all things that god had done with them
but there rose up certain of the sect of the pharisees which believed saying that it was needful to circumcise them and to command them to keep the law of moses
and the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter
and when there had been much disputing peter rose up and said unto them men and brethren ye know how that a good while ago god made choice among us that the gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel and believe
and god which knoweth the hearts bare them witness giving them the holy ghost even as he did unto us
and put no difference between us and them purifying their hearts by faith
now therefore why tempt ye god to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear
but we believe that through the grace of the lord jesus christ we shall be saved even as they
then all the multitude kept silence and gave audience to barnabas and paul declaring what miracles and wonders god had wrought among the gentiles by them
and after they had held their peace james answered saying men and brethren hearken unto me
simeon hath declared how god at the first did visit the gentiles to take out of them a people for his name
and to this agree the words of the prophets as it is written
after this i will return and will build again the tabernacle of david which is fallen down and i will build again the ruins thereof and i will set it up
that the residue of men might seek after the lord and all the gentiles upon whom my name is called saith the lord who doeth all these things
known unto god are all his works from the beginning of the world
wherefore my sentence is that we trouble not them which from among the gentiles are turned to god
but that we write unto them that they abstain from pollutions of idols and from fornication and from things strangled and from blood
for moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him being read in the synagogues every sabbath day
then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church to send chosen men of their own company to antioch with paul and barnabas namely judas surnamed barsabas and silas chief men among the brethren
and they wrote letters by them after this manner the apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the gentiles in antioch and syria and cilicia
forasmuch as we have heard that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words subverting your souls saying ye must be circumcised and keep the law to whom we gave no such commandment
it seemed good unto us being assembled with one accord to send chosen men unto you with our beloved barnabas and paul
men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our lord jesus christ
we have sent therefore judas and silas who shall also tell you the same things by mouth
for it seemed good to the holy ghost and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things
that ye abstain from meats offered to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication from which if ye keep yourselves ye shall do well fare ye well
so when they were dismissed they came to antioch and when they had gathered the multitude together they delivered the epistle
which when they had read they rejoiced for the consolation
and judas and silas being prophets also themselves exhorted the brethren with many words and confirmed them
and after they had tarried there a space they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles
notwithstanding it pleased silas to abide there still
paul also and barnabas continued in antioch teaching and preaching the word of the lord with many others also
and some days after paul said unto barnabas let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the lord and see how they do
and barnabas determined to take with them john whose surname was mark
but paul thought not good to take him with them who departed from them from pamphylia and went not with them to the work
and the contention was so sharp between them that they departed asunder one from the other and so barnabas took mark and sailed unto cyprus
and paul chose silas and departed being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of god
and he went through syria and cilicia confirming the churches
then came he to derbe and lystra and behold a certain disciple was there named timotheus the son of a certain woman which was a jewess and believed but his father was a greek
which was well reported of by the brethren that were at lystra and iconium
him would paul have to go forth with him and took and circumcised him because of the jews which were in those quarters for they knew all that his father was a greek
and as they went through the cities they delivered them the decrees for to keep that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at jerusalem
and so were the churches established in the faith and increased in number daily
now when they had gone throughout phrygia and the region of galatia and were forbidden of the holy ghost to preach the word in asia
after they were come to mysia they assayed to go into bithynia but the spirit suffered them not
and they passing by mysia came down to troas
and a vision appeared to paul in the night there stood a man of macedonia and prayed him saying come over into macedonia and help us
and after he had seen the vision immediately we endeavoured to go into macedonia assuredly gathering that the lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them
therefore loosing from troas we came with a straight course to samothracia and the next day to neapolis
and from thence to philippi which is the chief city of that part of macedonia and a colony and we were in that city abiding certain days
and on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side where prayer was wont to be made and we sat down and spake unto the women which resorted thither
and a certain woman named lydia a seller of purple of the city of thyatira which worshipped god heard us whose heart the lord opened that she attended unto the things which were spoken of paul
and when she was baptized and her household she besought us saying if ye have judged me to be faithful to the lord come into my house and abide there and she constrained us
and it came to pass as we went to prayer a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying
the same followed paul and us and cried saying these men are the servants of the most high god which shew unto us the way of salvation
and this did she many days but paul being grieved turned and said to the spirit i command thee in the name of jesus christ to come out of her and he came out the same hour
and when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone they caught paul and silas and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers
and brought them to the magistrates saying these men being jews do exceedingly trouble our city
and teach customs which are not lawful for us to receive neither to observe being romans
and the multitude rose up together against them and the magistrates rent off their clothes and commanded to beat them
and when they had laid many stripes upon them they cast them into prison charging the jailor to keep them safely
who having received such a charge thrust them into the inner prison and made their feet fast in the stocks
and at midnight paul and silas prayed and sang praises unto god and the prisoners heard them
and suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison were shaken and immediately all the doors were opened and every ones bands were loosed
and the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep and seeing the prison doors open he drew out his sword and would have killed himself supposing that the prisoners had been fled
but paul cried with a loud voice saying do thyself no harm for we are all here
then he called for a light and sprang in and came trembling and fell down before paul and silas
and brought them out and said sirs what must i do to be saved
and they said believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved and thy house
and they spake unto him the word of the lord and to all that were in his house
and he took them the same hour of the night and washed their stripes and was baptized he and all his straightway
and when he had brought them into his house he set meat before them and rejoiced believing in god with all his house
and when it was day the magistrates sent the serjeants saying let those men go
and the keeper of the prison told this saying to paul the magistrates have sent to let you go now therefore depart and go in peace
but paul said unto them they have beaten us openly uncondemned being romans and have cast us into prison and now do they thrust us out privily nay verily but let them come themselves and fetch us out
and the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates and they feared when they heard that they were romans
and they came and besought them and brought them out and desired them to depart out of the city
and they went out of the prison and entered into the house of lydia and when they had seen the brethren they comforted them and departed
now when they had passed through amphipolis and apollonia they came to thessalonica where was a synagogue of the jews
and paul as his manner was went in unto them and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures
opening and alleging that christ must needs have suffered and risen again from the dead and that this jesus whom i preach unto you is christ
and some of them believed and consorted with paul and silas and of the devout greeks a great multitude and of the chief women not a few
but the jews which believed not moved with envy took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort and gathered a company and set all the city on an uproar and assaulted the house of jason and sought to bring them out to the people
and when they found them not they drew jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city crying these that have turned the world upside down are come hither also
whom jason hath received and these all do contrary to the decrees of caesar saying that there is another king one jesus
and they troubled the people and the rulers of the city when they heard these things
and when they had taken security of jason and of the other they let them go
and the brethren immediately sent away paul and silas by night unto berea who coming thither went into the synagogue of the jews
these were more noble than those in thessalonica in that they received the word with all readiness of mind and searched the scriptures daily whether those things were so
therefore many of them believed also of honourable women which were greeks and of men not a few
but when the jews of thessalonica had knowledge that the word of god was preached of paul at berea they came thither also and stirred up the people
and then immediately the brethren sent away paul to go as it were to the sea but silas and timotheus abode there still
and they that conducted paul brought him unto athens and receiving a commandment unto silas and timotheus for to come to him with all speed they departed
now while paul waited for them at athens his spirit was stirred in him when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry
therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the jews and with the devout persons and in the market daily with them that met with him
then certain philosophers of the epicureans and of the stoicks encountered him and some said what will this babbler say other some he seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods because he preached unto them jesus and the resurrection
and they took him and brought him unto areopagus saying may we know what this new doctrine whereof thou speakest is
for thou bringest certain strange things to our ears we would know therefore what these things mean
for all the athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing
then paul stood in the midst of mars hill and said ye men of athens i perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious
for as i passed by and beheld your devotions i found an altar with this inscription to the unknown god whom therefore ye ignorantly worship him declare i unto you
god that made the world and all things therein seeing that he is lord of heaven and earth dwelleth not in temples made with hands
neither is worshipped with mens hands as though he needed any thing seeing he giveth to all life and breath and all things
and hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth and hath determined the times before appointed and the bounds of their habitation
that they should seek the lord if haply they might feel after him and find him though he be not far from every one of us
for in him we live and move and have our being as certain also of your own poets have said for we are also his offspring
forasmuch then as we are the offspring of god we ought not to think that the godhead is like unto gold or silver or stone graven by art and mans device
and the times of this ignorance god winked at but now commandeth all men every where to repent
because he hath appointed a day in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained whereof he hath given assurance unto all men in that he hath raised him from the dead
and when they heard of the resurrection of the dead some mocked and others said we will hear thee again of this matter
so paul departed from among them
howbeit certain men clave unto him and believed among the which was dionysius the areopagite and a woman named damaris and others with them
after these things paul departed from athens and came to corinth
and found a certain jew named aquila born in pontus lately come from italy with his wife priscilla because that claudius had commanded all jews to depart from rome and came unto them
and because he was of the same craft he abode with them and wrought for by their occupation they were tentmakers
and he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath and persuaded the jews and the greeks
and when silas and timotheus were come from macedonia paul was pressed in the spirit and testified to the jews that jesus was christ
and when they opposed themselves and blasphemed he shook his raiment and said unto them your blood be upon your own heads i am clean from henceforth i will go unto the gentiles
and he departed thence and entered into a certain mans house named justus one that worshipped god whose house joined hard to the synagogue
and crispus the chief ruler of the synagogue believed on the lord with all his house and many of the corinthians hearing believed and were baptized
then spake the lord to paul in the night by a vision be not afraid but speak and hold not thy peace
for i am with thee and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee for i have much people in this city
and he continued there a year and six months teaching the word of god among them
and when gallio was the deputy of achaia the jews made insurrection with one accord against paul and brought him to the judgment seat
saying this fellow persuadeth men to worship god contrary to the law
and when paul was now about to open his mouth gallio said unto the jews if it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness o ye jews reason would that i should bear with you
but if it be a question of words and names and of your law look ye to it for i will be no judge of such matters
and he drave them from the judgment seat
then all the greeks took sosthenes the chief ruler of the synagogue and beat him before the judgment seat and gallio cared for none of those things
and paul after this tarried there yet a good while and then took his leave of the brethren and sailed thence into syria and with him priscilla and aquila having shorn his head in cenchrea for he had a vow
and he came to ephesus and left them there but he himself entered into the synagogue and reasoned with the jews
when they desired him to tarry longer time with them he consented not
but bade them farewell saying i must by all means keep this feast that cometh in jerusalem but i will return again unto you if god will and he sailed from ephesus
and when he had landed at caesarea and gone up and saluted the church he went down to antioch
and after he had spent some time there he departed and went over all the country of galatia and phrygia in order strengthening all the disciples
and a certain jew named apollos born at alexandria an eloquent man and mighty in the scriptures came to ephesus
this man was instructed in the way of the lord and being fervent in the spirit he spake and taught diligently the things of the lord knowing only the baptism of john
and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue whom when aquila and priscilla had heard they took him unto them and expounded unto him the way of god more perfectly
and when he was disposed to pass into achaia the brethren wrote exhorting the disciples to receive him who when he was come helped them much which had believed through grace
for he mightily convinced the jews and that publickly shewing by the scriptures that jesus was christ
and it came to pass that while apollos was at corinth paul having passed through the upper coasts came to ephesus and finding certain disciples
he said unto them have ye received the holy ghost since ye believed and they said unto him we have not so much as heard whether there be any holy ghost
and he said unto them unto what then were ye baptized and they said unto johns baptism
then said paul john verily baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on christ jesus
when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus
and when paul had laid his hands upon them the holy ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied
and all the men were about twelve
and he went into the synagogue and spake boldly for the space of three months disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of god
but when divers were hardened and believed not but spake evil of that way before the multitude he departed from them and separated the disciples disputing daily in the school of one tyrannus
and this continued by the space of two years so that all they which dwelt in asia heard the word of the lord jesus both jews and greeks
and god wrought special miracles by the hands of paul
so that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons and the diseases departed from them and the evil spirits went out of them
then certain of the vagabond jews exorcists took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the lord jesus saying we adjure you by jesus whom paul preacheth
and there were seven sons of one sceva a jew and chief of the priests which did so
and the evil spirit answered and said jesus i know and paul i know but who are ye
and the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them and overcame them and prevailed against them so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded
and this was known to all the jews and greeks also dwelling at ephesus and fear fell on them all and the name of the lord jesus was magnified
and many that believed came and confessed and shewed their deeds
many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together and burned them before all men and they counted the price of them and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver
so mightily grew the word of god and prevailed
after these things were ended paul purposed in the spirit when he had passed through macedonia and achaia to go to jerusalem saying after i have been there i must also see rome
so he sent into macedonia two of them that ministered unto him timotheus and erastus but he himself stayed in asia for a season
and the same time there arose no small stir about that way
for a certain man named demetrius a silversmith which made silver shrines for diana brought no small gain unto the craftsmen
whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation and said sirs ye know that by this craft we have our wealth
moreover ye see and hear that not alone at ephesus but almost throughout all asia this paul hath persuaded and turned away much people saying that they be no gods which are made with hands
so that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought but also that the temple of the great goddess diana should be despised and her magnificence should be destroyed whom all asia and the world worshippeth
and when they heard these sayings they were full of wrath and cried out saying great is diana of the ephesians
and the whole city was filled with confusion and having caught gaius and aristarchus men of macedonia pauls companions in travel they rushed with one accord into the theatre
and when paul would have entered in unto the people the disciples suffered him not
and certain of the chief of asia which were his friends sent unto him desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre
some therefore cried one thing and some another for the assembly was confused and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together
and they drew alexander out of the multitude the jews putting him forward and alexander beckoned with the hand and would have made his defence unto the people
but when they knew that he was a jew all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out great is diana of the ephesians
and when the townclerk had appeased the people he said ye men of ephesus what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess diana and of the image which fell down from jupiter
seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against ye ought to be quiet and to do nothing rashly
for ye have brought hither these men which are neither robbers of churches nor yet blasphemers of your goddess
wherefore if demetrius and the craftsmen which are with him have a matter against any man the law is open and there are deputies let them implead one another
but if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters it shall be determined in a lawful assembly
for we are in danger to be called in question for this days uproar there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse
and when he had thus spoken he dismissed the assembly
and after the uproar was ceased paul called unto him the disciples and embraced them and departed for to go into macedonia
and when he had gone over those parts and had given them much exhortation he came into greece
and there abode three months and when the jews laid wait for him as he was about to sail into syria he purposed to return through macedonia
and there accompanied him into asia sopater of berea and of the thessalonians aristarchus and secundus and gaius of derbe and timotheus and of asia tychicus and trophimus
these going before tarried for us at troas
and we sailed away from philippi after the days of unleavened bread and came unto them to troas in five days where we abode seven days
and upon the first day of the week when the disciples came together to break bread paul preached unto them ready to depart on the morrow and continued his speech until midnight
and there were many lights in the upper chamber where they were gathered together
and there sat in a window a certain young man named eutychus being fallen into a deep sleep and as paul was long preaching he sunk down with sleep and fell down from the third loft and was taken up dead
and paul went down and fell on him and embracing him said trouble not yourselves for his life is in him
when he therefore was come up again and had broken bread and eaten and talked a long while even till break of day so he departed
and they brought the young man alive and were not a little comforted
and we went before to ship and sailed unto assos there intending to take in paul for so had he appointed minding himself to go afoot
and when he met with us at assos we took him in and came to mitylene
and we sailed thence and came the next day over against chios and the next day we arrived at samos and tarried at trogyllium and the next day we came to miletus
for paul had determined to sail by ephesus because he would not spend the time in asia for he hasted if it were possible for him to be at jerusalem the day of pentecost
and from miletus he sent to ephesus and called the elders of the church
and when they were come to him he said unto them ye know from the first day that i came into asia after what manner i have been with you at all seasons
serving the lord with all humility of mind and with many tears and temptations which befell me by the lying in wait of the jews
and how i kept back nothing that was profitable unto you but have shewed you and have taught you publickly and from house to house
testifying both to the jews and also to the greeks repentance toward god and faith toward our lord jesus christ
and now behold i go bound in the spirit unto jerusalem not knowing the things that shall befall me there
save that the holy ghost witnesseth in every city saying that bonds and afflictions abide me
but none of these things move me neither count i my life dear unto myself so that i might finish my course with joy and the ministry which i have received of the lord jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of god
and now behold i know that ye all among whom i have gone preaching the kingdom of god shall see my face no more
wherefore i take you to record this day that i am pure from the blood of all men
for i have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of god
take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over the which the holy ghost hath made you overseers to feed the church of god which he hath purchased with his own blood
for i know this that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock
also of your own selves shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them
therefore watch and remember that by the space of three years i ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears
and now brethren i commend you to god and to the word of his grace which is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified
i have coveted no mans silver or gold or apparel
yea ye yourselves know that these hands have ministered unto my necessities and to them that were with me
i have shewed you all things how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak and to remember the words of the lord jesus how he said it is more blessed to give than to receive
and when he had thus spoken he kneeled down and prayed with them all
and they all wept sore and fell on pauls neck and kissed him
sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake that they should see his face no more and they accompanied him unto the ship
and it came to pass that after we were gotten from them and had launched we came with a straight course unto coos and the day following unto rhodes and from thence unto patara
and finding a ship sailing over unto phenicia we went aboard and set forth
now when we had discovered cyprus we left it on the left hand and sailed into syria and landed at tyre for there the ship was to unlade her burden
and finding disciples we tarried there seven days who said to paul through the spirit that he should not go up to jerusalem
and when we had accomplished those days we departed and went our way and they all brought us on our way with wives and children till we were out of the city and we kneeled down on the shore and prayed
and when we had taken our leave one of another we took ship and they returned home again
and when we had finished our course from tyre we came to ptolemais and saluted the brethren and abode with them one day
and the next day we that were of pauls company departed and came unto caesarea and we entered into the house of philip the evangelist which was one of the seven and abode with him
and the same man had four daughters virgins which did prophesy
and as we tarried there many days there came down from judaea a certain prophet named agabus
and when he was come unto us he took pauls girdle and bound his own hands and feet and said thus saith the holy ghost so shall the jews at jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle and shall deliver him into the hands of the gentiles
and when we heard these things both we and they of that place besought him not to go up to jerusalem
then paul answered what mean ye to weep and to break mine heart for i am ready not to be bound only but also to die at jerusalem for the name of the lord jesus
and when he would not be persuaded we ceased saying the will of the lord be done
and after those days we took up our carriages and went up to jerusalem
there went with us also certain of the disciples of caesarea and brought with them one mnason of cyprus an old disciple with whom we should lodge
and when we were come to jerusalem the brethren received us gladly
and the day following paul went in with us unto james and all the elders were present
and when he had saluted them he declared particularly what things god had wrought among the gentiles by his ministry
and when they heard it they glorified the lord and said unto him thou seest brother how many thousands of jews there are which believe and they are all zealous of the law
and they are informed of thee that thou teachest all the jews which are among the gentiles to forsake moses saying that they ought not to circumcise their children neither to walk after the customs
what is it therefore the multitude must needs come together for they will hear that thou art come
do therefore this that we say to thee we have four men which have a vow on them
them take and purify thyself with them and be at charges with them that they may shave their heads and all may know that those things whereof they were informed concerning thee are nothing but that thou thyself also walkest orderly and keepest the law
as touching the gentiles which believe we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols and from blood and from strangled and from fornication
then paul took the men and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification until that an offering should be offered for every one of them
and when the seven days were almost ended the jews which were of asia when they saw him in the temple stirred up all the people and laid hands on him
crying out men of israel help this is the man that teacheth all men every where against the people and the law and this place and further brought greeks also into the temple and hath polluted this holy place
for they had seen before with him in the city trophimus an ephesian whom they supposed that paul had brought into the temple
and all the city was moved and the people ran together and they took paul and drew him out of the temple and forthwith the doors were shut
and as they went about to kill him tidings came unto the chief captain of the band that all jerusalem was in an uproar
who immediately took soldiers and centurions and ran down unto them and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers they left beating of paul
then the chief captain came near and took him and commanded him to be bound with two chains and demanded who he was and what he had done
and some cried one thing some another among the multitude and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult he commanded him to be carried into the castle
and when he came upon the stairs so it was that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people
for the multitude of the people followed after crying away with him
and as paul was to be led into the castle he said unto the chief captain may i speak unto thee who said canst thou speak greek
art not thou that egyptian which before these days madest an uproar and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers
but paul said i am a man which am a jew of tarsus a city in cilicia a citizen of no mean city and i beseech thee suffer me to speak unto the people
and when he had given him licence paul stood on the stairs and beckoned with the hand unto the people and when there was made a great silence he spake unto them in the hebrew tongue saying
men brethren and fathers hear ye my defence which i make now unto you
and when they heard that he spake in the hebrew tongue to them they kept the more silence and he saith
i am verily a man which am a jew born in tarsus a city in cilicia yet brought up in this city at the feet of gamaliel and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers and was zealous toward god as ye all are this day
and i persecuted this way unto the death binding and delivering into prisons both men and women
as also the high priest doth bear me witness and all the estate of the elders from whom also i received letters unto the brethren and went to damascus to bring them which were there bound unto jerusalem for to be punished
and it came to pass that as i made my journey and was come nigh unto damascus about noon suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me
and i fell unto the ground and heard a voice saying unto me saul saul why persecutest thou me
and i answered who art thou lord and he said unto me i am jesus of nazareth whom thou persecutest
and they that were with me saw indeed the light and were afraid but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me
and i said what shall i do lord and the lord said unto me arise and go into damascus and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do
and when i could not see for the glory of that light being led by the hand of them that were with me i came into damascus
and one ananias a devout man according to the law having a good report of all the jews which dwelt there
came unto me and stood and said unto me brother saul receive thy sight and the same hour i looked up upon him
and he said the god of our fathers hath chosen thee that thou shouldest know his will and see that just one and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth
for thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard
and now why tarriest thou arise and be baptized and wash away thy sins calling on the name of the lord
and it came to pass that when i was come again to jerusalem even while i prayed in the temple i was in a trance
and saw him saying unto me make haste and get thee quickly out of jerusalem for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me
and i said lord they know that i imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee
and when the blood of thy martyr stephen was shed i also was standing by and consenting unto his death and kept the raiment of them that slew him
and he said unto me depart for i will send thee far hence unto the gentiles
and they gave him audience unto this word and then lifted up their voices and said away with such a fellow from the earth for it is not fit that he should live
and as they cried out and cast off their clothes and threw dust into the air
the chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle and bade that he should be examined by scourging that he might know wherefore they cried so against him
and as they bound him with thongs paul said unto the centurion that stood by is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a roman and uncondemned
when the centurion heard that he went and told the chief captain saying take heed what thou doest for this man is a roman
then the chief captain came and said unto him tell me art thou a roman he said yea
and the chief captain answered with a great sum obtained i this freedom and paul said but i was free born
then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him and the chief captain also was afraid after he knew that he was a roman and because he had bound him
on the morrow because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the jews he loosed him from his bands and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear and brought paul down and set him before them
and paul earnestly beholding the council said men and brethren i have lived in all good conscience before god until this day
and the high priest ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth
then said paul unto him god shall smite thee thou whited wall for sittest thou to judge me after the law and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law
and they that stood by said revilest thou gods high priest
then said paul i wist not brethren that he was the high priest for it is written thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people
but when paul perceived that the one part were sadducees and the other pharisees he cried out in the council men and brethren i am a pharisee the son of a pharisee of the hope and resurrection of the dead i am called in question
and when he had so said there arose a dissension between the pharisees and the sadducees and the multitude was divided
for the sadducees say that there is no resurrection neither angel nor spirit but the pharisees confess both
and there arose a great cry and the scribes that were of the pharisees part arose and strove saying we find no evil in this man but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him let us not fight against god
and when there arose a great dissension the chief captain fearing lest paul should have been pulled in pieces of them commanded the soldiers to go down and to take him by force from among them and to bring him into the castle
and the night following the lord stood by him and said be of good cheer paul for as thou hast testified of me in jerusalem so must thou bear witness also at rome
and when it was day certain of the jews banded together and bound themselves under a curse saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed paul
and they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy
and they came to the chief priests and elders and said we have bound ourselves under a great curse that we will eat nothing until we have slain paul
now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him and we or ever he come near are ready to kill him
and when pauls sisters son heard of their lying in wait he went and entered into the castle and told paul
then paul called one of the centurions unto him and said bring this young man unto the chief captain for he hath a certain thing to tell him
so he took him and brought him to the chief captain and said paul the prisoner called me unto him and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee who hath something to say unto thee
then the chief captain took him by the hand and went with him aside privately and asked him what is that thou hast to tell me
and he said the jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down paul to morrow into the council as though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly
but do not thou yield unto them for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men which have bound themselves with an oath that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him and now are they ready looking for a promise from thee
so the chief captain then let the young man depart and charged him see thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me
and he called unto him two centurions saying make ready two hundred soldiers to go to caesarea and horsemen threescore and ten and spearmen two hundred at the third hour of the night
and provide them beasts that they may set paul on and bring him safe unto felix the governor
and he wrote a letter after this manner
claudius lysias unto the most excellent governor felix sendeth greeting
this man was taken of the jews and should have been killed of them then came i with an army and rescued him having understood that he was a roman
and when i would have known the cause wherefore they accused him i brought him forth into their council
whom i perceived to be accused of questions of their law but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds
and when it was told me how that the jews laid wait for the man i sent straightway to thee and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him farewell
then the soldiers as it was commanded them took paul and brought him by night to antipatris
on the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him and returned to the castle
who when they came to caesarea and delivered the epistle to the governor presented paul also before him
and when the governor had read the letter he asked of what province he was and when he understood that he was of cilicia
i will hear thee said he when thine accusers are also come and he commanded him to be kept in herods judgment hall
and after five days ananias the high priest descended with the elders and with a certain orator named tertullus who informed the governor against paul
and when he was called forth tertullus began to accuse him saying seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence
we accept it always and in all places most noble felix with all thankfulness
notwithstanding that i be not further tedious unto thee i pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words
for we have found this man a pestilent fellow and a mover of sedition among all the jews throughout the world and a ringleader of the sect of the nazarenes
who also hath gone about to profane the temple whom we took and would have judged according to our law
but the chief captain lysias came upon us and with great violence took him away out of our hands
commanding his accusers to come unto thee by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things whereof we accuse him
and the jews also assented saying that these things were so
then paul after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak answered forasmuch as i know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation i do the more cheerfully answer for myself
because that thou mayest understand that there are yet but twelve days since i went up to jerusalem for to worship
and they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man neither raising up the people neither in the synagogues nor in the city
neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me
but this i confess unto thee that after the way which they call heresy so worship i the god of my fathers believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets
and have hope toward god which they themselves also allow that there shall be a resurrection of the dead both of the just and unjust
and herein do i exercise myself to have always a conscience void to offence toward god and toward men
now after many years i came to bring alms to my nation and offerings
whereupon certain jews from asia found me purified in the temple neither with multitude nor with tumult
who ought to have been here before thee and object if they had ought against me
or else let these same here say if they have found any evil doing in me while i stood before the council
except it be for this one voice that i cried standing among them touching the resurrection of the dead i am called in question by you this day
and when felix heard these things having more perfect knowledge of that way he deferred them and said when lysias the chief captain shall come down i will know the uttermost of your matter
and he commanded a centurion to keep paul and to let him have liberty and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him
and after certain days when felix came with his wife drusilla which was a jewess he sent for paul and heard him concerning the faith in christ
and as he reasoned of righteousness temperance and judgment to come felix trembled and answered go thy way for this time when i have a convenient season i will call for thee
he hoped also that money should have been given him of paul that he might loose him wherefore he sent for him the oftener and communed with him
but after two years porcius festus came into felix room and felix willing to shew the jews a pleasure left paul bound
now when festus was come into the province after three days he ascended from caesarea to jerusalem
then the high priest and the chief of the jews informed him against paul and besought him
and desired favour against him that he would send for him to jerusalem laying wait in the way to kill him
but festus answered that paul should be kept at caesarea and that he himself would depart shortly thither
let them therefore said he which among you are able go down with me and accuse this man if there be any wickedness in him
and when he had tarried among them more than ten days he went down unto caesarea and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded paul to be brought
and when he was come the jews which came down from jerusalem stood round about and laid many and grievous complaints against paul which they could not prove
while he answered for himself neither against the law of the jews neither against the temple nor yet against caesar have i offended any thing at all
but festus willing to do the jews a pleasure answered paul and said wilt thou go up to jerusalem and there be judged of these things before me
then said paul i stand at caesars judgment seat where i ought to be judged to the jews have i done no wrong as thou very well knowest
for if i be an offender or have committed any thing worthy of death i refuse not to die but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me no man may deliver me unto them i appeal unto caesar
then festus when he had conferred with the council answered hast thou appealed unto caesar unto caesar shalt thou go
and after certain days king agrippa and bernice came unto caesarea to salute festus
and when they had been there many days festus declared pauls cause unto the king saying there is a certain man left in bonds by felix
about whom when i was at jerusalem the chief priests and the elders of the jews informed me desiring to have judgment against him
to whom i answered it is not the manner of the romans to deliver any man to die before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him
therefore when they were come hither without any delay on the morrow i sat on the judgment seat and commanded the man to be brought forth
against whom when the accusers stood up they brought none accusation of such things as i supposed
but had certain questions against him of their own superstition and of one jesus which was dead whom paul affirmed to be alive
and because i doubted of such manner of questions i asked him whether he would go to jerusalem and there be judged of these matters
but when paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of augustus i commanded him to be kept till i might send him to caesar
then agrippa said unto festus i would also hear the man myself to morrow said he thou shalt hear him
and on the morrow when agrippa was come and bernice with great pomp and was entered into the place of hearing with the chief captains and principal men of the city at festus commandment paul was brought forth
and festus said king agrippa and all men which are here present with us ye see this man about whom all the multitude of the jews have dealt with me both at jerusalem and also here crying that he ought not to live any longer
but when i found that he had committed nothing worthy of death and that he himself hath appealed to augustus i have determined to send him
of whom i have no certain thing to write unto my lord wherefore i have brought him forth before you and specially before thee o king agrippa that after examination had i might have somewhat to write
for it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him
then agrippa said unto paul thou art permitted to speak for thyself then paul stretched forth the hand and answered for himself
i think myself happy king agrippa because i shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof i am accused of the jews
especially because i know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the jews wherefore i beseech thee to hear me patiently
my manner of life from my youth which was at the first among mine own nation at jerusalem know all the jews
which knew me from the beginning if they would testify that after the most straitest sect of our religion i lived a pharisee
and now i stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of god unto our fathers
unto which promise our twelve tribes instantly serving god day and night hope to come for which hopes sake king agrippa i am accused of the jews
why should it be thought a thing incredible with you that god should raise the dead
i verily thought with myself that i ought to do many things contrary to the name of jesus of nazareth
which thing i also did in jerusalem and many of the saints did i shut up in prison having received authority from the chief priests and when they were put to death i gave my voice against them
and i punished them oft in every synagogue and compelled them to blaspheme and being exceedingly mad against them i persecuted them even unto strange cities
whereupon as i went to damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests
at midday o king i saw in the way a light from heaven above the brightness of the sun shining round about me and them which journeyed with me
and when we were all fallen to the earth i heard a voice speaking unto me and saying in the hebrew tongue saul saul why persecutest thou me it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks
and i said who art thou lord and he said i am jesus whom thou persecutest
but rise and stand upon thy feet for i have appeared unto thee for this purpose to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen and of those things in the which i will appear unto thee
delivering thee from the people and from the gentiles unto whom now i send thee
to open their eyes and to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of satan unto god that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me
whereupon o king agrippa i was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision
but shewed first unto them of damascus and at jerusalem and throughout all the coasts of judaea and then to the gentiles that they should repent and turn to god and do works meet for repentance
for these causes the jews caught me in the temple and went about to kill me
having therefore obtained help of god i continue unto this day witnessing both to small and great saying none other things than those which the prophets and moses did say should come
that christ should suffer and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead and should shew light unto the people and to the gentiles
and as he thus spake for himself festus said with a loud voice paul thou art beside thyself much learning doth make thee mad
but he said i am not mad most noble festus but speak forth the words of truth and soberness
for the king knoweth of these things before whom also i speak freely for i am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him for this thing was not done in a corner
king agrippa believest thou the prophets i know that thou believest
then agrippa said unto paul almost thou persuadest me to be a christian
and paul said i would to god that not only thou but also all that hear me this day were both almost and altogether such as i am except these bonds
and when he had thus spoken the king rose up and the governor and bernice and they that sat with them
and when they were gone aside they talked between themselves saying this man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds
then said agrippa unto festus this man might have been set at liberty if he had not appealed unto caesar
and when it was determined that we should sail into italy they delivered paul and certain other prisoners unto one named julius a centurion of augustus band
and entering into a ship of adramyttium we launched meaning to sail by the coasts of asia one aristarchus a macedonian of thessalonica being with us
and the next day we touched at sidon and julius courteously entreated paul and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself
and when we had launched from thence we sailed under cyprus because the winds were contrary
and when we had sailed over the sea of cilicia and pamphylia we came to myra a city of lycia
and there the centurion found a ship of alexandria sailing into italy and he put us therein
and when we had sailed slowly many days and scarce were come over against cnidus the wind not suffering us we sailed under crete over against salmone
and hardly passing it came unto a place which is called the fair havens nigh whereunto was the city of lasea
now when much time was spent and when sailing was now dangerous because the fast was now already past paul admonished them
and said unto them sirs i perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage not only of the lading and ship but also of our lives
nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship more than those things which were spoken by paul
and because the haven was not commodious to winter in the more part advised to depart thence also if by any means they might attain to phenice and there to winter which is an haven of crete and lieth toward the south west and north west
and when the south wind blew softly supposing that they had obtained their purpose loosing thence they sailed close by crete
but not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind called euroclydon
and when the ship was caught and could not bear up into the wind we let her drive
and running under a certain island which is called clauda we had much work to come by the boat
which when they had taken up they used helps undergirding the ship and fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands strake sail and so were driven
and we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest the next day they lightened the ship
and the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship
and when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared and no small tempest lay on us all hope that we should be saved was then taken away
but after long abstinence paul stood forth in the midst of them and said sirs ye should have hearkened unto me and not have loosed from crete and to have gained this harm and loss
and now i exhort you to be of good cheer for there shall be no loss of any mans life among you but of the ship
for there stood by me this night the angel of god whose i am and whom i serve
saying fear not paul thou must be brought before caesar and lo god hath given thee all them that sail with thee
wherefore sirs be of good cheer for i believe god that it shall be even as it was told me
howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island
but when the fourteenth night was come as we were driven up and down in adria about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country
and sounded and found it twenty fathoms and when they had gone a little further they sounded again and found it fifteen fathoms
then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks they cast four anchors out of the stern and wished for the day
and as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship when they had let down the boat into the sea under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship
paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers except these abide in the ship ye cannot be saved
then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat and let her fall off
and while the day was coming on paul besought them all to take meat saying this day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting having taken nothing
wherefore i pray you to take some meat for this is for your health for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you
and when he had thus spoken he took bread and gave thanks to god in presence of them all and when he had broken it he began to eat
then were they all of good cheer and they also took some meat
and we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls
and when they had eaten enough they lightened the ship and cast out the wheat into the sea
and when it was day they knew not the land but they discovered a certain creek with a shore into the which they were minded if it were possible to thrust in the ship
and when they had taken up the anchors they committed themselves unto the sea and loosed the rudder bands and hoised up the mainsail to the wind and made toward shore
and falling into a place where two seas met they ran the ship aground and the forepart stuck fast and remained unmoveable but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves
and the soldiers counsel was to kill the prisoners lest any of them should swim out and escape
but the centurion willing to save paul kept them from their purpose and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea and get to land
and the rest some on boards and some on broken pieces of the ship and so it came to pass that they escaped all safe to land
and when they were escaped then they knew that the island was called melita
and the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness for they kindled a fire and received us every one because of the present rain and because of the cold
and when paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire there came a viper out of the heat and fastened on his hand
and when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand they said among themselves no doubt this man is a murderer whom though he hath escaped the sea yet vengeance suffereth not to live
and he shook off the beast into the fire and felt no harm
howbeit they looked when he should have swollen or fallen down dead suddenly but after they had looked a great while and saw no harm come to him they changed their minds and said that he was a god
in the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island whose name was publius who received us and lodged us three days courteously
and it came to pass that the father of publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux to whom paul entered in and prayed and laid his hands on him and healed him
so when this was done others also which had diseases in the island came and were healed
who also honoured us with many honours and when we departed they laded us with such things as were necessary
and after three months we departed in a ship of alexandria which had wintered in the isle whose sign was castor and pollux
and landing at syracuse we tarried there three days
and from thence we fetched a compass and came to rhegium and after one day the south wind blew and we came the next day to puteoli
where we found brethren and were desired to tarry with them seven days and so we went toward rome
and from thence when the brethren heard of us they came to meet us as far as appii forum and the three taverns whom when paul saw he thanked god and took courage
and when we came to rome the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard but paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him
and it came to pass that after three days paul called the chief of the jews together and when they were come together he said unto them men and brethren though i have committed nothing against the people or customs of our fathers yet was i delivered prisoner from jerusalem into the hands of the romans
who when they had examined me would have let me go because there was no cause of death in me
but when the jews spake against it i was constrained to appeal unto caesar not that i had ought to accuse my nation of
for this cause therefore have i called for you to see you and to speak with you because that for the hope of israel i am bound with this chain
and they said unto him we neither received letters out of judaea concerning thee neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee
but we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest for as concerning this sect we know that every where it is spoken against
and when they had appointed him a day there came many to him into his lodging to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of god persuading them concerning jesus both out of the law of moses and out of the prophets from morning till evening
and some believed the things which were spoken and some believed not
and when they agreed not among themselves they departed after that paul had spoken one word well spake the holy ghost by esaias the prophet unto our fathers
saying go unto this people and say hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing ye shall see and not perceive
for the heart of this people is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes have they closed lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and should be converted and i should heal them
be it known therefore unto you that the salvation of god is sent unto the gentiles and that they will hear it
and when he had said these words the jews departed and had great reasoning among themselves
and paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house and received all that came in unto him
preaching the kingdom of god and teaching those things which concern the lord jesus christ with all confidence no man forbidding him
that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life
for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and shew unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us
that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son jesus christ
and these things write we unto you that your joy may be full
this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that god is light and in him is no darkness at all
if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth
but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanseth us from all sin
if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us
if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness
if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us
my little children these things write i unto you that ye sin not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous
and he is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world
and hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his commandments
he that saith i know him and keepeth not his commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him
but whoso keepeth his word in him verily is the love of god perfected hereby know we that we are in him
he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk even as he walked
brethren i write no new commandment unto you but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning the old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning
again a new commandment i write unto you which thing is true in him and in you because the darkness is past and the true light now shineth
he that saith he is in the light and hateth his brother is in darkness even until now
he that loveth his brother abideth in the light and there is none occasion of stumbling in him
but he that hateth his brother is in darkness and walketh in darkness and knoweth not whither he goeth because that darkness hath blinded his eyes
i write unto you little children because your sins are forgiven you for his names sake
i write unto you fathers because ye have known him that is from the beginning i write unto you young men because ye have overcome the wicked one i write unto you little children because ye have known the father
i have written unto you fathers because ye have known him that is from the beginning i have written unto you young men because ye are strong and the word of god abideth in you and ye have overcome the wicked one
love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him
for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world
and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of god abideth for ever
little children it is the last time and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come even now are there many antichrists whereby we know that it is the last time
they went out from us but they were not of us for if they had been of us they would no doubt have continued with us but they went out that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us
but ye have an unction from the holy one and ye know all things
i have not written unto you because ye know not the truth but because ye know it and that no lie is of the truth
who is a liar but he that denieth that jesus is the christ he is antichrist that denieth the father and the son
whosoever denieth the son the same hath not the father he that acknowledgeth the son hath the father also
let that therefore abide in you which ye have heard from the beginning if that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you ye also shall continue in the son and in the father
and this is the promise that he hath promised us even eternal life
these things have i written unto you concerning them that seduce you
but the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you and ye need not that any man teach you but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things and is truth and is no lie and even as it hath taught you ye shall abide in him
and now little children abide in him that when he shall appear we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming
if ye know that he is righteous ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him
behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not
beloved now are we the sons of god and it doth not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is
and every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure
whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law for sin is the transgression of the law
and ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins and in him is no sin
whosoever abideth in him sinneth not whosoever sinneth hath not seen him neither known him
little children let no man deceive you he that doeth righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous
he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil
whosoever is born of god doth not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of god
in this the children of god are manifest and the children of the devil whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of god neither he that loveth not his brother
for this is the message that ye heard from the beginning that we should love one another
not as cain who was of that wicked one and slew his brother and wherefore slew he him because his own works were evil and his brothers righteous
marvel not my brethren if the world hate you
we know that we have passed from death unto life because we love the brethren he that loveth not his brother abideth in death
whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him
hereby perceive we the love of god because he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren
but whoso hath this worlds good and seeth his brother have need and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him how dwelleth the love of god in him
my little children let us not love in word neither in tongue but in deed and in truth
and hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our hearts before him
for if our heart condemn us god is greater than our heart and knoweth all things
beloved if our heart condemn us not then have we confidence toward god
and whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight
and this is his commandment that we should believe on the name of his son jesus christ and love one another as he gave us commandment
and he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him and he in him and hereby we know that he abideth in us by the spirit which he hath given us
beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world
hereby know ye the spirit of god every spirit that confesseth that jesus christ is come in the flesh is of god
and every spirit that confesseth not that jesus christ is come in the flesh is not of god and this is that spirit of antichrist whereof ye have heard that it should come and even now already is it in the world
ye are of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world
they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth them
we are of god he that knoweth god heareth us he that is not of god heareth not us hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error
beloved let us love one another for love is of god and every one that loveth is born of god and knoweth god
he that loveth not knoweth not god for god is love
in this was manifested the love of god toward us because that god sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him
herein is love not that we loved god but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins
beloved if god so loved us we ought also to love one another
no man hath seen god at any time if we love one another god dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us
hereby know we that we dwell in him and he in us because he hath given us of his spirit
and we have seen and do testify that the father sent the son to be the saviour of the world
whosoever shall confess that jesus is the son of god god dwelleth in him and he in god
and we have known and believed the love that god hath to us god is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him
herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world
there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love
we love him because he first loved us
if a man say i love god and hateth his brother he is a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen how can he love god whom he hath not seen
and this commandment have we from him that he who loveth god love his brother also
whosoever believeth that jesus is the christ is born of god and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him
by this we know that we love the children of god when we love god and keep his commandments
for this is the love of god that we keep his commandments and his commandments are not grievous
for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith
who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that jesus is the son of god
this is he that came by water and blood even jesus christ not by water only but by water and blood and it is the spirit that beareth witness because the spirit is truth
for there are three that bear record in heaven the father the word and the holy ghost and these three are one
and there are three that bear witness in earth the spirit and the water and the blood and these three agree in one
if we receive the witness of men the witness of god is greater for this is the witness of god which he hath testified of his son
he that believeth on the son of god hath the witness in himself he that believeth not god hath made him a liar because he believeth not the record that god gave of his son
and this is the record that god hath given to us eternal life and this life is in his son
he that hath the son hath life and he that hath not the son of god hath not life
these things have i written unto you that believe on the name of the son of god that ye may know that ye have eternal life and that ye may believe on the name of the son of god
and this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask any thing according to his will he heareth us
and if we know that he hear us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him
if any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death he shall ask and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death there is a sin unto death i do not say that he shall pray for it
all unrighteousness is sin and there is a sin not unto death
we know that whosoever is born of god sinneth not but he that is begotten of god keepeth himself and that wicked one toucheth him not
and we know that we are of god and the whole world lieth in wickedness
and we know that the son of god is come and hath given us an understanding that we may know him that is true and we are in him that is true even in his son jesus christ this is the true god and eternal life
little children keep yourselves from idols amen
the elder unto the elect lady and her children whom i love in the truth and not i only but also all they that have known the truth
for the truths sake which dwelleth in us and shall be with us for ever
grace be with you mercy and peace from god the father and from the lord jesus christ the son of the father in truth and love
i rejoiced greatly that i found of thy children walking in truth as we have received a commandment from the father
and now i beseech thee lady not as though i wrote a new commandment unto thee but that which we had from the beginning that we love one another
and this is love that we walk after his commandments this is the commandment that as ye have heard from the beginning ye should walk in it
for many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that jesus christ is come in the flesh this is a deceiver and an antichrist
look to yourselves that we lose not those things which we have wrought but that we receive a full reward
whosoever transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of christ hath not god he that abideth in the doctrine of christ he hath both the father and the son
if there come any unto you and bring not this doctrine receive him not into your house neither bid him god speed
for he that biddeth him god speed is partaker of his evil deeds
having many things to write unto you i would not write with paper and ink but i trust to come unto you and speak face to face that our joy may be full
the children of thy elect sister greet thee amen
peter an apostle of jesus christ to the strangers scattered throughout pontus galatia cappadocia asia and bithynia
elect according to the foreknowledge of god the father through sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of jesus christ grace unto you and peace be multiplied
blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead
to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you
who are kept by the power of god through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time
wherein ye greatly rejoice though now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations
that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of jesus christ
whom having not seen ye love in whom though now ye see him not yet believing ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory
receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls
of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you
searching what or what manner of time the spirit of christ which was in them did signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of christ and the glory that should follow
unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they did minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the holy ghost sent down from heaven which things the angels desire to look into
wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of jesus christ
as obedient children not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance
but as he which hath called you is holy so be ye holy in all manner of conversation
because it is written be ye holy for i am holy
and if ye call on the father who without respect of persons judgeth according to every mans work pass the time of your sojourning here in fear
forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers
but with the precious blood of christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot
who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you
who by him do believe in god that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory that your faith and hope might be in god
seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently
being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and abideth for ever
for all flesh is as grass and all the glory of man as the flower of grass the grass withereth and the flower thereof falleth away
but the word of the lord endureth for ever and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you
wherefore laying aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envies all evil speakings
as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby
if so be ye have tasted that the lord is gracious
to whom coming as unto a living stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of god and precious
ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house an holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ
wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold i lay in sion a chief corner stone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded
unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same is made the head of the corner
and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient whereunto also they were appointed
but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood an holy nation a peculiar people that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light
which in time past were not a people but are now the people of god which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy
dearly beloved i beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul
having your conversation honest among the gentiles that whereas they speak against you as evildoers they may by your good works which they shall behold glorify god in the day of visitation
submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the lords sake whether it be to the king as supreme
or unto governors as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of them that do well
for so is the will of god that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men
as free and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness but as the servants of god
honour all men love the brotherhood fear god honour the king
servants be subject to your masters with all fear not only to the good and gentle but also to the froward
for this is thankworthy if a man for conscience toward god endure grief suffering wrongfully
for what glory is it if when ye be buffeted for your faults ye shall take it patiently but if when ye do well and suffer for it ye take it patiently this is acceptable with god
for even hereunto were ye called because christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that ye should follow his steps
who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth
who when he was reviled reviled not again when he suffered he threatened not but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously
who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness by whose stripes ye were healed
for ye were as sheep going astray but are now returned unto the shepherd and bishop of your souls
likewise ye wives be in subjection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives
while they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear
whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair and of wearing of gold or of putting on of apparel
but let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptible even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of god of great price
for after this manner in the old time the holy women also who trusted in god adorned themselves being in subjection unto their own husbands
even as sara obeyed abraham calling him lord whose daughters ye are as long as ye do well and are not afraid with any amazement
likewise ye husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honour unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered
finally be ye all of one mind having compassion one of another love as brethren be pitiful be courteous
not rendering evil for evil or railing for railing but contrariwise blessing knowing that ye are thereunto called that ye should inherit a blessing
for he that will love life and see good days let him refrain his tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no guile
let him eschew evil and do good let him seek peace and ensue it
for the eyes of the lord are over the righteous and his ears are open unto their prayers but the face of the lord is against them that do evil
and who is he that will harm you if ye be followers of that which is good
but and if ye suffer for righteousness sake happy are ye and be not afraid of their terror neither be troubled
but sanctify the lord god in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear
having a good conscience that whereas they speak evil of you as of evildoers they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in christ
for it is better if the will of god be so that ye suffer for well doing than for evil doing
for christ also hath once suffered for sins the just for the unjust that he might bring us to god being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the spirit
by which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison
which sometime were disobedient when once the longsuffering of god waited in the days of noah while the ark was a preparing wherein few that is eight souls were saved by water
the like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us not the putting away of the filth of the flesh but the answer of a good conscience toward god by the resurrection of jesus christ
who is gone into heaven and is on the right hand of god angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him
forasmuch then as christ hath suffered for us in the flesh arm yourselves likewise with the same mind for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin
that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men but to the will of god
for the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the gentiles when we walked in lasciviousness lusts excess of wine revellings banquetings and abominable idolatries
wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot speaking evil of you
who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead
for for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead that they might be judged according to men in the flesh but live according to god in the spirit
but the end of all things is at hand be ye therefore sober and watch unto prayer
and above all things have fervent charity among yourselves for charity shall cover the multitude of sins
use hospitality one to another without grudging
as every man hath received the gift even so minister the same one to another as good stewards of the manifold grace of god
if any man speak let him speak as the oracles of god if any man minister let him do it as of the ability which god giveth that god in all things may be glorified through jesus christ to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever amen
beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you
but rejoice inasmuch as ye are partakers of christs sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed ye may be glad also with exceeding joy
if ye be reproached for the name of christ happy are ye for the spirit of glory and of god resteth upon you on their part he is evil spoken of but on your part he is glorified
but let none of you suffer as a murderer or as a thief or as an evildoer or as a busybody in other mens matters
yet if any man suffer as a christian let him not be ashamed but let him glorify god on this behalf
for the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of god and if it first begin at us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of god
and if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear
wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of god commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing as unto a faithful creator
the elders which are among you i exhort who am also an elder and a witness of the sufferings of christ and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed
feed the flock of god which is among you taking the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly not for filthy lucre but of a ready mind
neither as being lords over gods heritage but being ensamples to the flock
and when the chief shepherd shall appear ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away
likewise ye younger submit yourselves unto the elder yea all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for god resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble
humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god that he may exalt you in due time
casting all your care upon him for he careth for you
be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour
whom resist stedfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world
but the god of all grace who hath called us unto his eternal glory by christ jesus after that ye have suffered a while make you perfect stablish strengthen settle you
to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever amen
by silvanus a faithful brother unto you as i suppose i have written briefly exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of god wherein ye stand
the church that is at babylon elected together with you saluteth you and so doth marcus my son
greet ye one another with a kiss of charity peace be with you all that are in christ jesus amen

then joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a publick example was minded to put her away privily
but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a dream saying joseph thou son of david fear not to take unto thee mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the holy ghost
and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name jesus for he shall save his people from their sins
now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by the prophet saying
behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name emmanuel which being interpreted is god with us
then joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the lord had bidden him and took unto him his wife
and knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son and he called his name jesus
now when jesus was born in bethlehem of judaea in the days of herod the king behold there came wise men from the east to jerusalem
saying where is he that is born king of the jews for we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship him
when herod the king had heard these things he was troubled and all jerusalem with him
and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together he demanded of them where christ should be born
and they said unto him in bethlehem of judaea for thus it is written by the prophet
and thou bethlehem in the land of juda art not the least among the princes of juda for out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule my people israel
then herod when he had privily called the wise men enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared
and he sent them to bethlehem and said go and search diligently for the young child and when ye have found him bring me word again that i may come and worship him also
when they had heard the king they departed and lo the star which they saw in the east went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was
when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy
and when they were come into the house they saw the young child with mary his mother and fell down and worshipped him and when they had opened their treasures they presented unto him gifts gold and frankincense and myrrh
and being warned of god in a dream that they should not return to herod they departed into their own country another way
and when they were departed behold the angel of the lord appeareth to joseph in a dream saying arise and take the young child and his mother and flee into egypt and be thou there until i bring thee word for herod will seek the young child to destroy him
when he arose he took the young child and his mother by night and departed into egypt
and was there until the death of herod that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by the prophet saying out of egypt have i called my son
then herod when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men was exceeding wroth and sent forth and slew all the children that were in bethlehem and in all the coasts thereof from two years old and under according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men
then was fulfilled that which was spoken by jeremy the prophet saying
in rama was there a voice heard lamentation and weeping and great mourning rachel weeping for her children and would not be comforted because they are not
but when herod was dead behold an angel of the lord appeareth in a dream to joseph in egypt
saying arise and take the young child and his mother and go into the land of israel for they are dead which sought the young childs life
and he arose and took the young child and his mother and came into the land of israel
but when he heard that archelaus did reign in judaea in the room of his father herod he was afraid to go thither notwithstanding being warned of god in a dream he turned aside into the parts of galilee
and he came and dwelt in a city called nazareth that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets he shall be called a nazarene
in those days came john the baptist preaching in the wilderness of judaea
and saying repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is at hand
for this is he that was spoken of by the prophet esaias saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make his paths straight
and the same john had his raiment of camels hair and a leathern girdle about his loins and his meat was locusts and wild honey
then went out to him jerusalem and all judaea and all the region round about jordan
and were baptized of him in jordan confessing their sins
but when he saw many of the pharisees and sadducees come to his baptism he said unto them o generation of vipers who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come
bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance
and think not to say within yourselves we have abraham to our father for i say unto you that god is able of these stones to raise up children unto abraham
and now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire
i indeed baptize you with water unto repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than i whose shoes i am not worthy to bear he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire
whose fan is in his hand and he will throughly purge his floor and gather his wheat into the garner but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire
then cometh jesus from galilee to jordan unto john to be baptized of him
but john forbad him saying i have need to be baptized of thee and comest thou to me
and jesus answering said unto him suffer it to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness then he suffered him
and jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove and lighting upon him
and lo a voice from heaven saying this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased
then was jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil
and when he had fasted forty days and forty nights he was afterward an hungred
and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the son of god command that these stones be made bread
but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god
then the devil taketh him up into the holy city and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple
and saith unto him if thou be the son of god cast thyself down for it is written he shall give his angels charge concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone
jesus said unto him it is written again thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god
again the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them
and saith unto him all these things will i give thee if thou wilt fall down and worship me
then saith jesus unto him get thee hence satan for it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve
then the devil leaveth him and behold angels came and ministered unto him
now when jesus had heard that john was cast into prison he departed into galilee
and leaving nazareth he came and dwelt in capernaum which is upon the sea coast in the borders of zabulon and nephthalim
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by esaias the prophet saying
the land of zabulon and the land of nephthalim by the way of the sea beyond jordan galilee of the gentiles
the people which sat in darkness saw great light and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up
from that time jesus began to preach and to say repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand
and jesus walking by the sea of galilee saw two brethren simon called peter and andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for they were fishers
and he saith unto them follow me and i will make you fishers of men
and they straightway left their nets and followed him
and going on from thence he saw other two brethren james the son of zebedee and john his brother in a ship with zebedee their father mending their nets and he called them
and they immediately left the ship and their father and followed him
and jesus went about all galilee teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people
and his fame went throughout all syria and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments and those which were possessed with devils and those which were lunatick and those that had the palsy and he healed them
and there followed him great multitudes of people from galilee and from decapolis and from jerusalem and from judaea and from beyond jordan
and seeing the multitudes he went up into a mountain and when he was set his disciples came unto him
and he opened his mouth and taught them saying
blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted
blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth
blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled
blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy
blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god
blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of god
blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake
rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you
ye are the salt of the earth but if the salt have lost his savour wherewith shall it be salted it is thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot of men
ye are the light of the world a city that is set on an hill cannot be hid
neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house
let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven
think not that i am come to destroy the law or the prophets i am not come to destroy but to fulfil
for verily i say unto you till heaven and earth pass one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled
whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments and shall teach men so he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven but whosoever shall do and teach them the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven
for i say unto you that except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven
ye have heard that it was said of them of old time thou shalt not kill and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment
but i say unto you that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment and whosoever shall say to his brother raca shall be in danger of the council but whosoever shall say thou fool shall be in danger of hell fire
therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee
leave there thy gift before the altar and go thy way first be reconciled to thy brother and then come and offer thy gift
agree with thine adversary quickly whiles thou art in the way with him lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge and the judge deliver thee to the officer and thou be cast into prison
verily i say unto thee thou shalt by no means come out thence till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing
ye have heard that it was said by them of old time thou shalt not commit adultery
but i say unto you that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart
and if thy right eye offend thee pluck it out and cast it from thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell
and if thy right hand offend thee cut it off and cast it from thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell
it hath been said whosoever shall put away his wife let him give her a writing of divorcement
but i say unto you that whosoever shall put away his wife saving for the cause of fornication causeth her to commit adultery and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery
again ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time thou shalt not forswear thyself but shalt perform unto the lord thine oaths
but i say unto you swear not at all neither by heaven for it is gods throne
nor by the earth for it is his footstool neither by jerusalem for it is the city of the great king
neither shalt thou swear by thy head because thou canst not make one hair white or black
but let your communication be yea yea nay nay for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil
ye have heard that it hath been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
but i say unto you that ye resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also
and if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat let him have thy cloak also
and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile go with him twain
give to him that asketh thee and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away
ye have heard that it hath been said thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate thine enemy
but i say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you
that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust
for if ye love them which love you what reward have ye do not even the publicans the same
and if ye salute your brethren only what do ye more than others do not even the publicans so
be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect
take heed that ye do not your alms before men to be seen of them otherwise ye have no reward of your father which is in heaven
therefore when thou doest thine alms do not sound a trumpet before thee as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets that they may have glory of men verily i say unto you they have their reward
but when thou doest alms let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth
that thine alms may be in secret and thy father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly
and when thou prayest thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men verily i say unto you they have their reward
but thou when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thou hast shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly
but when ye pray use not vain repetitions as the heathen do for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking
be not ye therefore like unto them for your father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye ask him
after this manner therefore pray ye our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name
thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven
give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors
and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory for ever amen
for if ye forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you
but if ye forgive not men their trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses
moreover when ye fast be not as the hypocrites of a sad countenance for they disfigure their faces that they may appear unto men to fast verily i say unto you they have their reward
but thou when thou fastest anoint thine head and wash thy face
that thou appear not unto men to fast but unto thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly
lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth where moth and rust doth corrupt and where thieves break through and steal
but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal
for where your treasure is there will your heart be also
the light of the body is the eye if therefore thine eye be single thy whole body shall be full of light
but if thine eye be evil thy whole body shall be full of darkness if therefore the light that is in thee be darkness how great is that darkness
no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other ye cannot serve god and mammon
therefore i say unto you take no thought for your life what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink nor yet for your body what ye shall put on is not the life more than meat and the body than raiment
behold the fowls of the air for they sow not neither do they reap nor gather into barns yet your heavenly father feedeth them are ye not much better than they
which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature
and why take ye thought for raiment consider the lilies of the field how they grow they toil not neither do they spin
and yet i say unto you that even solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these
wherefore if god so clothe the grass of the field which to day is and to morrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you o ye of little faith
therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewithal shall we be clothed
for after all these things do the gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of all these things
but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you
take therefore no thought for the morrow for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof
judge not that ye be not judged
for with what judgment ye judge ye shall be judged and with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you again
and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brothers eye but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye
or how wilt thou say to thy brother let me pull out the mote out of thine eye and behold a beam is in thine own eye
thou hypocrite first cast out the beam out of thine own eye and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brothers eye
give not that which is holy unto the dogs neither cast ye your pearls before swine lest they trample them under their feet and turn again and rend you
ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you
for every one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened
or what man is there of you whom if his son ask bread will he give him a stone
or if he ask a fish will he give him a serpent
if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him
therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them for this is the law and the prophets
enter ye in at the strait gate for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and many there be which go in thereat
because strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life and few there be that find it
beware of false prophets which come to you in sheeps clothing but inwardly they are ravening wolves
ye shall know them by their fruits do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles
even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit
a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit
every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire
wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them
not every one that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven
many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works
and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity
therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them i will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock
and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock
and every one that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand
and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of it
and it came to pass when jesus had ended these sayings the people were astonished at his doctrine
for he taught them as one having authority and not as the scribes
when he was come down from the mountain great multitudes followed him
and behold there came a leper and worshipped him saying lord if thou wilt thou canst make me clean
and jesus put forth his hand and touched him saying i will be thou clean and immediately his leprosy was cleansed
and jesus saith unto him see thou tell no man but go thy way shew thyself to the priest and offer the gift that moses commanded for a testimony unto them
and when jesus was entered into capernaum there came unto him a centurion beseeching him
and saying lord my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy grievously tormented
and jesus saith unto him i will come and heal him
the centurion answered and said lord i am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed
for i am a man under authority having soldiers under me and i say to this man go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he doeth it
when jesus heard it he marvelled and said to them that followed verily i say unto you i have not found so great faith no not in israel
and i say unto you that many shall come from the east and west and shall sit down with abraham and isaac and jacob in the kingdom of heaven
but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth
and jesus said unto the centurion go thy way and as thou hast believed so be it done unto thee and his servant was healed in the selfsame hour
and when jesus was come into peters house he saw his wifes mother laid and sick of a fever
and he touched her hand and the fever left her and she arose and ministered unto them
when the even was come they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils and he cast out the spirits with his word and healed all that were sick
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by esaias the prophet saying himself took our infirmities and bare our sicknesses
now when jesus saw great multitudes about him he gave commandment to depart unto the other side
and a certain scribe came and said unto him master i will follow thee whithersoever thou goest
and jesus saith unto him the foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests but the son of man hath not where to lay his head
and another of his disciples said unto him lord suffer me first to go and bury my father
but jesus said unto him follow me and let the dead bury their dead
and when he was entered into a ship his disciples followed him
and behold there arose a great tempest in the sea insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves but he was asleep
and his disciples came to him and awoke him saying lord save us we perish
and he saith unto them why are ye fearful o ye of little faith then he arose and rebuked the winds and the sea and there was a great calm
but the men marvelled saying what manner of man is this that even the winds and the sea obey him
and when he was come to the other side into the country of the gergesenes there met him two possessed with devils coming out of the tombs exceeding fierce so that no man might pass by that way
and behold they cried out saying what have we to do with thee jesus thou son of god art thou come hither to torment us before the time
and there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding
so the devils besought him saying if thou cast us out suffer us to go away into the herd of swine
and he said unto them go and when they were come out they went into the herd of swine and behold the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea and perished in the waters
and they that kept them fled and went their ways into the city and told every thing and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils
and behold the whole city came out to meet jesus and when they saw him they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts
and he entered into a ship and passed over and came into his own city
and behold they brought to him a man sick of the palsy lying on a bed and jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy son be of good cheer thy sins be forgiven thee
and behold certain of the scribes said within themselves this man blasphemeth
and jesus knowing their thoughts said wherefore think ye evil in your hearts
for whether is easier to say thy sins be forgiven thee or to say arise and walk
but that ye may know that the son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins then saith he to the sick of the palsy arise take up thy bed and go unto thine house
and he arose and departed to his house
but when the multitudes saw it they marvelled and glorified god which had given such power unto men
and as jesus passed forth from thence he saw a man named matthew sitting at the receipt of custom and he saith unto him follow me and he arose and followed him
and it came to pass as jesus sat at meat in the house behold many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples
and when the pharisees saw it they said unto his disciples why eateth your master with publicans and sinners
but when jesus heard that he said unto them they that be whole need not a physician but they that are sick
but go ye and learn what that meaneth i will have mercy and not sacrifice for i am not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance
then came to him the disciples of john saying why do we and the pharisees fast oft but thy disciples fast not
and jesus said unto them can the children of the bridechamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them and then shall they fast
no man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment and the rent is made worse
neither do men put new wine into old bottles else the bottles break and the wine runneth out and the bottles perish but they put new wine into new bottles and both are preserved
while he spake these things unto them behold there came a certain ruler and worshipped him saying my daughter is even now dead but come and lay thy hand upon her and she shall live
and jesus arose and followed him and so did his disciples
and behold a woman which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years came behind him and touched the hem of his garment
for she said within herself if i may but touch his garment i shall be whole
but jesus turned him about and when he saw her he said daughter be of good comfort thy faith hath made thee whole and the woman was made whole from that hour
and when jesus came into the rulers house and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise
he said unto them give place for the maid is not dead but sleepeth and they laughed him to scorn
but when the people were put forth he went in and took her by the hand and the maid arose
and the fame hereof went abroad into all that land
and when jesus departed thence two blind men followed him crying and saying thou son of david have mercy on us
and when he was come into the house the blind men came to him and jesus saith unto them believe ye that i am able to do this they said unto him yea lord
then touched he their eyes saying according to your faith be it unto you
and their eyes were opened and jesus straitly charged them saying see that no man know it
but they when they were departed spread abroad his fame in all that country
as they went out behold they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil
and when the devil was cast out the dumb spake and the multitudes marvelled saying it was never so seen in israel
but the pharisees said he casteth out devils through the prince of the devils
and jesus went about all the cities and villages teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every sickness and every disease among the people
but when he saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no shepherd
then saith he unto his disciples the harvest truly is plenteous but the labourers are few
pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest that he will send forth labourers into his harvest
and when he had called unto him his twelve disciples he gave them power against unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease
now the names of the twelve apostles are these the first simon who is called peter and andrew his brother james the son of zebedee and john his brother
philip and bartholomew thomas and matthew the publican james the son of alphaeus and lebbaeus whose surname was thaddaeus
simon the canaanite and judas iscariot who also betrayed him
these twelve jesus sent forth and commanded them saying go not into the way of the gentiles and into any city of the samaritans enter ye not
but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of israel
and as ye go preach saying the kingdom of heaven is at hand
heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise the dead cast out devils freely ye have received freely give
provide neither gold nor silver nor brass in your purses
nor scrip for your journey neither two coats neither shoes nor yet staves for the workman is worthy of his meat
and into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter enquire who in it is worthy and there abide till ye go thence
and when ye come into an house salute it
and if the house be worthy let your peace come upon it but if it be not worthy let your peace return to you
and whosoever shall not receive you nor hear your words when ye depart out of that house or city shake off the dust of your feet
verily i say unto you it shall be more tolerable for the land of sodom and gomorrha in the day of judgment than for that city
behold i send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves be ye therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves
but beware of men for they will deliver you up to the councils and they will scourge you in their synagogues
and ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake for a testimony against them and the gentiles
but when they deliver you up take no thought how or what ye shall speak for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak
for it is not ye that speak but the spirit of your father which speaketh in you
and the brother shall deliver up the brother to death and the father the child and the children shall rise up against their parents and cause them to be put to death
and ye shall be hated of all men for my names sake but he that endureth to the end shall be saved
but when they persecute you in this city flee ye into another for verily i say unto you ye shall not have gone over the cities of israel till the son of man be come
the disciple is not above his master nor the servant above his lord
it is enough for the disciple that he be as his master and the servant as his lord if they have called the master of the house beelzebub how much more shall they call them of his household
fear them not therefore for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed and hid that shall not be known
what i tell you in darkness that speak ye in light and what ye hear in the ear that preach ye upon the housetops
and fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell
are not two sparrows sold for a farthing and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your father
but the very hairs of your head are all numbered
fear ye not therefore ye are of more value than many sparrows
whosoever therefore shall confess me before men him will i confess also before my father which is in heaven
but whosoever shall deny me before men him will i also deny before my father which is in heaven
think not that i am come to send peace on earth i came not to send peace but a sword
for i am come to set a man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother and the daughter in law against her mother in law
and a mans foes shall be they of his own household
he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me
and he that taketh not his cross and followeth after me is not worthy of me
he that findeth his life shall lose it and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it
he that receiveth you receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me
he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophets reward and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous mans reward
and whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple verily i say unto you he shall in no wise lose his reward
and it came to pass when jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities
now when john had heard in the prison the works of christ he sent two of his disciples
and said unto him art thou he that should come or do we look for another
jesus answered and said unto them go and shew john again those things which ye do hear and see
the blind receive their sight and the lame walk the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear the dead are raised up and the poor have the gospel preached to them
and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me
and as they departed jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning john what went ye out into the wilderness to see a reed shaken with the wind
but what went ye out for to see a man clothed in soft raiment behold they that wear soft clothing are in kings houses
but what went ye out for to see a prophet yea i say unto you and more than a prophet
for this is he of whom it is written behold i send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee
verily i say unto you among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than john the baptist notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he
and from the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force
for all the prophets and the law prophesied until john
and if ye will receive it this is elias which was for to come
he that hath ears to hear let him hear
but whereunto shall i liken this generation it is like unto children sitting in the markets and calling unto their fellows
and saying we have piped unto you and ye have not danced we have mourned unto you and ye have not lamented
for john came neither eating nor drinking and they say he hath a devil
the son of man came eating and drinking and they say behold a man gluttonous and a winebibber a friend of publicans and sinners but wisdom is justified of her children
then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done because they repented not
woe unto thee chorazin woe unto thee bethsaida for if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in tyre and sidon they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes
but i say unto you it shall be more tolerable for tyre and sidon at the day of judgment than for you
and thou capernaum which art exalted unto heaven shalt be brought down to hell for if the mighty works which have been done in thee had been done in sodom it would have remained until this day
but i say unto you that it shall be more tolerable for the land of sodom in the day of judgment than for thee
at that time jesus answered and said i thank thee o father lord of heaven and earth because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes
even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight
all things are delivered unto me of my father and no man knoweth the son but the father neither knoweth any man the father save the son and he to whomsoever the son will reveal him
come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and i will give you rest
take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls
for my yoke is easy and my burden is light
at that time jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn and his disciples were an hungred and began to pluck the ears of corn and to eat
but when the pharisees saw it they said unto him behold thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day
but he said unto them have ye not read what david did when he was an hungred and they that were with him
how he entered into the house of god and did eat the shewbread which was not lawful for him to eat neither for them which were with him but only for the priests
or have ye not read in the law how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath and are blameless
but i say unto you that in this place is one greater than the temple
but if ye had known what this meaneth i will have mercy and not sacrifice ye would not have condemned the guiltless
for the son of man is lord even of the sabbath day
and when he was departed thence he went into their synagogue
and behold there was a man which had his hand withered and they asked him saying is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days that they might accuse him
and he said unto them what man shall there be among you that shall have one sheep and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day will he not lay hold on it and lift it out
how much then is a man better than a sheep wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days
then saith he to the man stretch forth thine hand and he stretched it forth and it was restored whole like as the other
then the pharisees went out and held a council against him how they might destroy him
but when jesus knew it he withdrew himself from thence and great multitudes followed him and he healed them all
and charged them that they should not make him known
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by esaias the prophet saying
behold my servant whom i have chosen my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased i will put my spirit upon him and he shall shew judgment to the gentiles
he shall not strive nor cry neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets
a bruised reed shall he not break and smoking flax shall he not quench till he send forth judgment unto victory
and in his name shall the gentiles trust
then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil blind and dumb and he healed him insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw
and all the people were amazed and said is not this the son of david
but when the pharisees heard it they said this fellow doth not cast out devils but by beelzebub the prince of the devils
and jesus knew their thoughts and said unto them every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand
and if satan cast out satan he is divided against himself how shall then his kingdom stand
and if i by beelzebub cast out devils by whom do your children cast them out therefore they shall be your judges
but if i cast out devils by the spirit of god then the kingdom of god is come unto you
or else how can one enter into a strong mans house and spoil his goods except he first bind the strong man and then he will spoil his house
he that is not with me is against me and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad
wherefore i say unto you all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men but the blasphemy against the holy ghost shall not be forgiven unto men
and whosoever speaketh a word against the son of man it shall be forgiven him but whosoever speaketh against the holy ghost it shall not be forgiven him neither in this world neither in the world to come
either make the tree good and his fruit good or else make the tree corrupt and his fruit corrupt for the tree is known by his fruit
o generation of vipers how can ye being evil speak good things for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh
a good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things
but i say unto you that every idle word that men shall speak they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment
for by thy words thou shalt be justified and by thy words thou shalt be condemned
then certain of the scribes and of the pharisees answered saying master we would see a sign from thee
but he answered and said unto them an evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of the prophet jonas
for as jonas was three days and three nights in the whales belly so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth
the men of nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it because they repented at the preaching of jonas and behold a greater than jonas is here
the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold a greater than solomon is here
when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh through dry places seeking rest and findeth none
then he saith i will return into my house from whence i came out and when he is come he findeth it empty swept and garnished
then goeth he and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last state of that man is worse than the first even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation
while he yet talked to the people behold his mother and his brethren stood without desiring to speak with him
then one said unto him behold thy mother and thy brethren stand without desiring to speak with thee
but he answered and said unto him that told him who is my mother and who are my brethren
and he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples and said behold my mother and my brethren
for whosoever shall do the will of my father which is in heaven the same is my brother and sister and mother
the same day went jesus out of the house and sat by the sea side
and great multitudes were gathered together unto him so that he went into a ship and sat and the whole multitude stood on the shore
and he spake many things unto them in parables saying behold a sower went forth to sow
and when he sowed some seeds fell by the way side and the fowls came and devoured them up
some fell upon stony places where they had not much earth and forthwith they sprung up because they had no deepness of earth
and when the sun was up they were scorched and because they had no root they withered away
and some fell among thorns and the thorns sprung up and choked them
but other fell into good ground and brought forth fruit some an hundredfold some sixtyfold some thirtyfold
who hath ears to hear let him hear
and the disciples came and said unto him why speakest thou unto them in parables
he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given
for whosoever hath to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but whosoever hath not from him shall be taken away even that he hath
therefore speak i to them in parables because they seeing see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand
and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of esaias which saith by hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing ye shall see and shall not perceive
for this peoples heart is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and i should heal them
but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear
for verily i say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see and have not seen them and to hear those things which ye hear and have not heard them
hear ye therefore the parable of the sower
when any one heareth the word of the kingdom and understandeth it not then cometh the wicked one and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart this is he which received seed by the way side
but he that received the seed into stony places the same is he that heareth the word and anon with joy receiveth it
yet hath he not root in himself but dureth for a while for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word by and by he is offended
he also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and he becometh unfruitful
but he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word and understandeth it which also beareth fruit and bringeth forth some an hundredfold some sixty some thirty
another parable put he forth unto them saying the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field
but while men slept his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way
but when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tares also
so the servants of the householder came and said unto him sir didst not thou sow good seed in thy field from whence then hath it tares
he said unto them an enemy hath done this the servants said unto him wilt thou then that we go and gather them up
but he said nay lest while ye gather up the tares ye root up also the wheat with them
let both grow together until the harvest and in the time of harvest i will say to the reapers gather ye together first the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn
another parable put he forth unto them saying the kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field
which indeed is the least of all seeds but when it is grown it is the greatest among herbs and becometh a tree so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof
another parable spake he unto them the kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till the whole was leavened
all these things spake jesus unto the multitude in parables and without a parable spake he not unto them
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying i will open my mouth in parables i will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world
then jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house and his disciples came unto him saying declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field
he answered and said unto them he that soweth the good seed is the son of man
the field is the world the good seed are the children of the kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked one
the enemy that sowed them is the devil the harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the angels
as therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire so shall it be in the end of this world
the son of man shall send forth his angels and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and them which do iniquity
and shall cast them into a furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth
then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their father who hath ears to hear let him hear
again the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field the which when a man hath found he hideth and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath and buyeth that field
again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man seeking goodly pearls
who when he had found one pearl of great price went and sold all that he had and bought it
again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net that was cast into the sea and gathered of every kind
which when it was full they drew to shore and sat down and gathered the good into vessels but cast the bad away
so shall it be at the end of the world the angels shall come forth and sever the wicked from among the just
and shall cast them into the furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth
jesus saith unto them have ye understood all these things they say unto him yea lord
then said he unto them therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old
and it came to pass that when jesus had finished these parables he departed thence
and when he was come into his own country he taught them in their synagogue insomuch that they were astonished and said whence hath this man this wisdom and these mighty works
is not this the carpenters son is not his mother called mary and his brethren james and joses and simon and judas
and his sisters are they not all with us whence then hath this man all these things
and they were offended in him but jesus said unto them a prophet is not without honour save in his own country and in his own house
and he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief
at that time herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of jesus
and said unto his servants this is john the baptist he is risen from the dead and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him
for herod had laid hold on john and bound him and put him in prison for herodias sake his brother philips wife
for john said unto him it is not lawful for thee to have her
and when he would have put him to death he feared the multitude because they counted him as a prophet
but when herods birthday was kept the daughter of herodias danced before them and pleased herod
whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask
and she being before instructed of her mother said give me here john baptists head in a charger
and the king was sorry nevertheless for the oaths sake and them which sat with him at meat he commanded it to be given her
and he sent and beheaded john in the prison
and his head was brought in a charger and given to the damsel and she brought it to her mother
and his disciples came and took up the body and buried it and went and told jesus
when jesus heard of it he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart and when the people had heard thereof they followed him on foot out of the cities
and jesus went forth and saw a great multitude and was moved with compassion toward them and he healed their sick
and when it was evening his disciples came to him saying this is a desert place and the time is now past send the multitude away that they may go into the villages and buy themselves victuals
but jesus said unto them they need not depart give ye them to eat
and they say unto him we have here but five loaves and two fishes
he said bring them hither to me
and he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass and took the five loaves and the two fishes and looking up to heaven he blessed and brake and gave the loaves to his disciples and the disciples to the multitude
and they did all eat and were filled and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full
and they that had eaten were about five thousand men beside women and children
and straightway jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship and to go before him unto the other side while he sent the multitudes away
and when he had sent the multitudes away he went up into a mountain apart to pray and when the evening was come he was there alone
but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves for the wind was contrary
and in the fourth watch of the night jesus went unto them walking on the sea
and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear
but straightway jesus spake unto them saying be of good cheer it is i be not afraid
and peter answered him and said lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the water
and he said come and when peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to jesus
but when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried saying lord save me
and immediately jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto him o thou of little faith wherefore didst thou doubt
and when they were come into the ship the wind ceased
then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him saying of a truth thou art the son of god
and when they were gone over they came into the land of gennesaret
and when the men of that place had knowledge of him they sent out into all that country round about and brought unto him all that were diseased
and besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment and as many as touched were made perfectly whole
then came to jesus scribes and pharisees which were of jerusalem saying
why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders for they wash not their hands when they eat bread
but he answered and said unto them why do ye also transgress the commandment of god by your tradition
for god commanded saying honour thy father and mother and he that curseth father or mother let him die the death
but ye say whosoever shall say to his father or his mother it is a gift by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me
and honour not his father or his mother he shall be free thus have ye made the commandment of god of none effect by your tradition
ye hypocrites well did esaias prophesy of you saying
this people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth and honoureth me with their lips but their heart is far from me
but in vain they do worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men
and he called the multitude and said unto them hear and understand
not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man but that which cometh out of the mouth this defileth a man
then came his disciples and said unto him knowest thou that the pharisees were offended after they heard this saying
but he answered and said every plant which my heavenly father hath not planted shall be rooted up
let them alone they be blind leaders of the blind and if the blind lead the blind both shall fall into the ditch
then answered peter and said unto him declare unto us this parable
and jesus said are ye also yet without understanding
do not ye yet understand that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly and is cast out into the draught
but those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart and they defile the man
for out of the heart proceed evil thoughts murders adulteries fornications thefts false witness blasphemies
these are the things which defile a man but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man
then jesus went thence and departed into the coasts of tyre and sidon
and behold a woman of canaan came out of the same coasts and cried unto him saying have mercy on me o lord thou son of david my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil
but he answered her not a word and his disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she crieth after us
but he answered and said i am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of israel
then came she and worshipped him saying lord help me
but he answered and said it is not meet to take the childrens bread and to cast it to dogs
and she said truth lord yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters table
then jesus answered and said unto her o woman great is thy faith be it unto thee even as thou wilt and her daughter was made whole from that very hour
and jesus departed from thence and came nigh unto the sea of galilee and went up into a mountain and sat down there
and great multitudes came unto him having with them those that were lame blind dumb maimed and many others and cast them down at jesus feet and he healed them
insomuch that the multitude wondered when they saw the dumb to speak the maimed to be whole the lame to walk and the blind to see and they glorified the god of israel
then jesus called his disciples unto him and said i have compassion on the multitude because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat and i will not send them away fasting lest they faint in the way
and his disciples say unto him whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness as to fill so great a multitude
and jesus saith unto them how many loaves have ye and they said seven and a few little fishes
and he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground
and he took the seven loaves and the fishes and gave thanks and brake them and gave to his disciples and the disciples to the multitude
and they did all eat and were filled and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full
and they that did eat were four thousand men beside women and children
and he sent away the multitude and took ship and came into the coasts of magdala
the pharisees also with the sadducees came and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven
he answered and said unto them when it is evening ye say it will be fair weather for the sky is red
and in the morning it will be foul weather to day for the sky is red and lowering o ye hypocrites ye can discern the face of the sky but can ye not discern the signs of the times
a wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given unto it but the sign of the prophet jonas and he left them and departed
and when his disciples were come to the other side they had forgotten to take bread
then jesus said unto them take heed and beware of the leaven of the pharisees and of the sadducees
and they reasoned among themselves saying it is because we have taken no bread
which when jesus perceived he said unto them o ye of little faith why reason ye among yourselves because ye have brought no bread
do ye not yet understand neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand and how many baskets ye took up
neither the seven loaves of the four thousand and how many baskets ye took up
how is it that ye do not understand that i spake it not to you concerning bread that ye should beware of the leaven of the pharisees and of the sadducees
then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread but of the doctrine of the pharisees and of the sadducees
when jesus came into the coasts of caesarea philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that i the son of man am
and they said some say that thou art john the baptist some elias and others jeremias or one of the prophets
he saith unto them but whom say ye that i am
and simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god
and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven
and i say also unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it
and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was jesus the christ
from that time forth began jesus to shew unto his disciples how that he must go unto jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and be raised again the third day
then peter took him and began to rebuke him saying be it far from thee lord this shall not be unto thee
but he turned and said unto peter get thee behind me satan thou art an offence unto me for thou savourest not the things that be of god but those that be of men
then said jesus unto his disciples if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me
for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it
for what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul
for the son of man shall come in the glory of his father with his angels and then he shall reward every man according to his works
verily i say unto you there be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the son of man coming in his kingdom
and after six days jesus taketh peter james and john his brother and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart
and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his raiment was white as the light
and behold there appeared unto them moses and elias talking with him
then answered peter and said unto jesus lord it is good for us to be here if thou wilt let us make here three tabernacles one for thee and one for moses and one for elias
while he yet spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased hear ye him
and when the disciples heard it they fell on their face and were sore afraid
and jesus came and touched them and said arise and be not afraid
and when they had lifted up their eyes they saw no man save jesus only
and as they came down from the mountain jesus charged them saying tell the vision to no man until the son of man be risen again from the dead
and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that elias must first come
and jesus answered and said unto them elias truly shall first come and restore all things
but i say unto you that elias is come already and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them
then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of john the baptist
and when they were come to the multitude there came to him a certain man kneeling down to him and saying
lord have mercy on my son for he is lunatick and sore vexed for ofttimes he falleth into the fire and oft into the water
and i brought him to thy disciples and they could not cure him
then jesus answered and said o faithless and perverse generation how long shall i be with you how long shall i suffer you bring him hither to me
and jesus rebuked the devil and he departed out of him and the child was cured from that very hour
then came the disciples to jesus apart and said why could not we cast him out
and jesus said unto them because of your unbelief for verily i say unto you if ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed ye shall say unto this mountain remove hence to yonder place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you
howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting
and while they abode in galilee jesus said unto them the son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men
and they shall kill him and the third day he shall be raised again and they were exceeding sorry
and when they were come to capernaum they that received tribute money came to peter and said doth not your master pay tribute
he saith yes and when he was come into the house jesus prevented him saying what thinkest thou simon of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute of their own children or of strangers
peter saith unto him of strangers jesus saith unto him then are the children free
notwithstanding lest we should offend them go thou to the sea and cast an hook and take up the fish that first cometh up and when thou hast opened his mouth thou shalt find a piece of money that take and give unto them for me and thee
at the same time came the disciples unto jesus saying who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven
and jesus called a little child unto him and set him in the midst of them
and said verily i say unto you except ye be converted and become as little children ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven
whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven
and whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me
but whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea
woe unto the world because of offences for it must needs be that offences come but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh
wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee cut them off and cast them from thee it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire
and if thine eye offend thee pluck it out and cast it from thee it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire
take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones for i say unto you that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven
for the son of man is come to save that which was lost
how think ye if a man have an hundred sheep and one of them be gone astray doth he not leave the ninety and nine and goeth into the mountains and seeketh that which is gone astray
and if so be that he find it verily i say unto you he rejoiceth more of that sheep than of the ninety and nine which went not astray
even so it is not the will of your father which is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish
moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone if he shall hear thee thou hast gained thy brother
but if he will not hear thee then take with thee one or two more that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established
and if he shall neglect to hear them tell it unto the church but if he neglect to hear the church let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican
verily i say unto you whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
again i say unto you that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven
for where two or three are gathered together in my name there am i in the midst of them
then came peter to him and said lord how oft shall my brother sin against me and i forgive him till seven times
jesus saith unto him i say not unto thee until seven times but until seventy times seven
therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king which would take account of his servants
and when he had begun to reckon one was brought unto him which owed him ten thousand talents
but forasmuch as he had not to pay his lord commanded him to be sold and his wife and children and all that he had and payment to be made
the servant therefore fell down and worshipped him saying lord have patience with me and i will pay thee all
then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion and loosed him and forgave him the debt
but the same servant went out and found one of his fellowservants which owed him an hundred pence and he laid hands on him and took him by the throat saying pay me that thou owest
and his fellowservant fell down at his feet and besought him saying have patience with me and i will pay thee all
and he would not but went and cast him into prison till he should pay the debt
so when his fellowservants saw what was done they were very sorry and came and told unto their lord all that was done
then his lord after that he had called him said unto him o thou wicked servant i forgave thee all that debt because thou desiredst me
shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant even as i had pity on thee
and his lord was wroth and delivered him to the tormentors till he should pay all that was due unto him
so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses
and it came to pass that when jesus had finished these sayings he departed from galilee and came into the coasts of judaea beyond jordan
and great multitudes followed him and he healed them there
the pharisees also came unto him tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause
and he answered and said unto them have ye not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female
and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh
wherefore they are no more twain but one flesh what therefore god hath joined together let not man put asunder
they say unto him why did moses then command to give a writing of divorcement and to put her away
he saith unto them moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so
and i say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery
his disciples say unto him if the case of the man be so with his wife it is not good to marry
but he said unto them all men cannot receive this saying save they to whom it is given
for there are some eunuchs which were so born from their mothers womb and there are some eunuchs which were made eunuchs of men and there be eunuchs which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heavens sake he that is able to receive it let him receive it
then were there brought unto him little children that he should put his hands on them and pray and the disciples rebuked them
but jesus said suffer little children and forbid them not to come unto me for of such is the kingdom of heaven
and he laid his hands on them and departed thence
and behold one came and said unto him good master what good thing shall i do that i may have eternal life
and he said unto him why callest thou me good there is none good but one that is god but if thou wilt enter into life keep the commandments
he saith unto him which jesus said thou shalt do no murder thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness
honour thy father and thy mother and thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself
the young man saith unto him all these things have i kept from my youth up what lack i yet
jesus said unto him if thou wilt be perfect go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me
but when the young man heard that saying he went away sorrowful for he had great possessions
then said jesus unto his disciples verily i say unto you that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven
and again i say unto you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god
when his disciples heard it they were exceedingly amazed saying who then can be saved
but jesus beheld them and said unto them with men this is impossible but with god all things are possible
then answered peter and said unto him behold we have forsaken all and followed thee what shall we have therefore
and jesus said unto them verily i say unto you that ye which have followed me in the regeneration when the son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel
and every one that hath forsaken houses or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my names sake shall receive an hundredfold and shall inherit everlasting life
but many that are first shall be last and the last shall be first
for the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard
and when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day he sent them into his vineyard
and he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace
and said unto them go ye also into the vineyard and whatsoever is right i will give you and they went their way
again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour and did likewise
and about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle and saith unto them why stand ye here all the day idle
they say unto him because no man hath hired us he saith unto them go ye also into the vineyard and whatsoever is right that shall ye receive
so when even was come the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward call the labourers and give them their hire beginning from the last unto the first
and when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour they received every man a penny
but when the first came they supposed that they should have received more and they likewise received every man a penny
and when they had received it they murmured against the goodman of the house
saying these last have wrought but one hour and thou hast made them equal unto us which have borne the burden and heat of the day
but he answered one of them and said friend i do thee no wrong didst not thou agree with me for a penny
take that thine is and go thy way i will give unto this last even as unto thee
is it not lawful for me to do what i will with mine own is thine eye evil because i am good
so the last shall be first and the first last for many be called but few chosen
and jesus going up to jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way and said unto them
behold we go up to jerusalem and the son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes and they shall condemn him to death
and shall deliver him to the gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify him and the third day he shall rise again
then came to him the mother of zebedees children with her sons worshipping him and desiring a certain thing of him
and he said unto her what wilt thou she saith unto him grant that these my two sons may sit the one on thy right hand and the other on the left in thy kingdom
but jesus answered and said ye know not what ye ask are ye able to drink of the cup that i shall drink of and to be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with they say unto him we are able
and he saith unto them ye shall drink indeed of my cup and be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with but to sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my father
and when the ten heard it they were moved with indignation against the two brethren
but jesus called them unto him and said ye know that the princes of the gentiles exercise dominion over them and they that are great exercise authority upon them
but it shall not be so among you but whosoever will be great among you let him be your minister
and whosoever will be chief among you let him be your servant
even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many
and as they departed from jericho a great multitude followed him
and behold two blind men sitting by the way side when they heard that jesus passed by cried out saying have mercy on us o lord thou son of david
and the multitude rebuked them because they should hold their peace but they cried the more saying have mercy on us o lord thou son of david
and jesus stood still and called them and said what will ye that i shall do unto you
they say unto him lord that our eyes may be opened
so jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes and immediately their eyes received sight and they followed him
and when they drew nigh unto jerusalem and were come to bethphage unto the mount of olives then sent jesus two disciples
saying unto them go into the village over against you and straightway ye shall find an ass tied and a colt with her loose them and bring them unto me
and if any man say ought unto you ye shall say the lord hath need of them and straightway he will send them
all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying
tell ye the daughter of sion behold thy king cometh unto thee meek and sitting upon an ass and a colt the foal of an ass
and the disciples went and did as jesus commanded them
and brought the ass and the colt and put on them their clothes and they set him thereon
and a very great multitude spread their garments in the way others cut down branches from the trees and strawed them in the way
and the multitudes that went before and that followed cried saying hosanna to the son of david blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest
and when he was come into jerusalem all the city was moved saying who is this
and the multitude said this is jesus the prophet of nazareth of galilee
and jesus went into the temple of god and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of them that sold doves
and said unto them it is written my house shall be called the house of prayer but ye have made it a den of thieves
and the blind and the lame came to him in the temple and he healed them
and when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did and the children crying in the temple and saying hosanna to the son of david they were sore displeased
and said unto him hearest thou what these say and jesus saith unto them yea have ye never read out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise
and he left them and went out of the city into bethany and he lodged there
now in the morning as he returned into the city he hungered
and when he saw a fig tree in the way he came to it and found nothing thereon but leaves only and said unto it let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever and presently the fig tree withered away
and when the disciples saw it they marvelled saying how soon is the fig tree withered away
jesus answered and said unto them verily i say unto you if ye have faith and doubt not ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree but also if ye shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea it shall be done
and all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing ye shall receive
and when he was come into the temple the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching and said by what authority doest thou these things and who gave thee this authority
and jesus answered and said unto them i also will ask you one thing which if ye tell me i in like wise will tell you by what authority i do these things
the baptism of john whence was it from heaven or of men and they reasoned with themselves saying if we shall say from heaven he will say unto us why did ye not then believe him
but if we shall say of men we fear the people for all hold john as a prophet
and they answered jesus and said we cannot tell and he said unto them neither tell i you by what authority i do these things
but what think ye a certain man had two sons and he came to the first and said son go work to day in my vineyard
he answered and said i will not but afterward he repented and went
and he came to the second and said likewise and he answered and said i go sir and went not
whether of them twain did the will of his father they say unto him the first jesus saith unto them verily i say unto you that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of god before you
for john came unto you in the way of righteousness and ye believed him not but the publicans and the harlots believed him and ye when ye had seen it repented not afterward that ye might believe him
hear another parable there was a certain householder which planted a vineyard and hedged it round about and digged a winepress in it and built a tower and let it out to husbandmen and went into a far country
and when the time of the fruit drew near he sent his servants to the husbandmen that they might receive the fruits of it
and the husbandmen took his servants and beat one and killed another and stoned another
again he sent other servants more than the first and they did unto them likewise
but last of all he sent unto them his son saying they will reverence my son
but when the husbandmen saw the son they said among themselves this is the heir come let us kill him and let us seize on his inheritance
and they caught him and cast him out of the vineyard and slew him
when the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh what will he do unto those husbandmen
they say unto him he will miserably destroy those wicked men and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen which shall render him the fruits in their seasons
jesus saith unto them did ye never read in the scriptures the stone which the builders rejected the same is become the head of the corner this is the lords doing and it is marvellous in our eyes
therefore say i unto you the kingdom of god shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof
and whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken but on whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder
and when the chief priests and pharisees had heard his parables they perceived that he spake of them
but when they sought to lay hands on him they feared the multitude because they took him for a prophet
and jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables and said
the kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king which made a marriage for his son
and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding and they would not come
again he sent forth other servants saying tell them which are bidden behold i have prepared my dinner my oxen and my fatlings are killed and all things are ready come unto the marriage
but they made light of it and went their ways one to his farm another to his merchandise
and the remnant took his servants and entreated them spitefully and slew them
but when the king heard thereof he was wroth and he sent forth his armies and destroyed those murderers and burned up their city
then saith he to his servants the wedding is ready but they which were bidden were not worthy
go ye therefore into the highways and as many as ye shall find bid to the marriage
so those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all as many as they found both bad and good and the wedding was furnished with guests
and when the king came in to see the guests he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment
and he saith unto him friend how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment and he was speechless
then said the king to the servants bind him hand and foot and take him away and cast him into outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth
for many are called but few are chosen
then went the pharisees and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk
and they sent out unto him their disciples with the herodians saying master we know that thou art true and teachest the way of god in truth neither carest thou for any man for thou regardest not the person of men
tell us therefore what thinkest thou is it lawful to give tribute unto caesar or not
but jesus perceived their wickedness and said why tempt ye me ye hypocrites
shew me the tribute money and they brought unto him a penny
and he saith unto them whose is this image and superscription
they say unto him caesars then saith he unto them render therefore unto caesar the things which are caesars and unto god the things that are gods
when they had heard these words they marvelled and left him and went their way
the same day came to him the sadducees which say that there is no resurrection and asked him
saying master moses said if a man die having no children his brother shall marry his wife and raise up seed unto his brother
now there were with us seven brethren and the first when he had married a wife deceased and having no issue left his wife unto his brother
likewise the second also and the third unto the seventh
and last of all the woman died also
therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven for they all had her
jesus answered and said unto them ye do err not knowing the scriptures nor the power of god
for in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as the angels of god in heaven
but as touching the resurrection of the dead have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by god saying
i am the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob god is not the god of the dead but of the living
and when the multitude heard this they were astonished at his doctrine
but when the pharisees had heard that he had put the sadducees to silence they were gathered together
then one of them which was a lawyer asked him a question tempting him and saying
master which is the great commandment in the law
jesus said unto him thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind
this is the first and great commandment
and the second is like unto it thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself
on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets
while the pharisees were gathered together jesus asked them
saying what think ye of christ whose son is he they say unto him the son of david
he saith unto them how then doth david in spirit call him lord saying
the lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand till i make thine enemies thy footstool
if david then call him lord how is he his son
and no man was able to answer him a word neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions
then spake jesus to the multitude and to his disciples
saying the scribes and the pharisees sit in moses seat
all therefore whatsoever they bid you observe that observe and do but do not ye after their works for they say and do not
for they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne and lay them on mens shoulders but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers
but all their works they do for to be seen of men they make broad their phylacteries and enlarge the borders of their garments
and love the uppermost rooms at feasts and the chief seats in the synagogues
and greetings in the markets and to be called of men rabbi rabbi
but be not ye called rabbi for one is your master even christ and all ye are brethren
and call no man your father upon the earth for one is your father which is in heaven
neither be ye called masters for one is your master even christ
but he that is greatest among you shall be your servant
and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted
but woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men for ye neither go in yourselves neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in
woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye devour widows houses and for a pretence make long prayer therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation
woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte and when he is made ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves
woe unto you ye blind guides which say whosoever shall swear by the temple it is nothing but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple he is a debtor
ye fools and blind for whether is greater the gold or the temple that sanctifieth the gold
and whosoever shall swear by the altar it is nothing but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it he is guilty
ye fools and blind for whether is greater the gift or the altar that sanctifieth the gift
whoso therefore shall swear by the altar sweareth by it and by all things thereon
and whoso shall swear by the temple sweareth by it and by him that dwelleth therein
and he that shall swear by heaven sweareth by the throne of god and by him that sitteth thereon
woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin and have omitted the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy and faith these ought ye to have done and not to leave the other undone
ye blind guides which strain at a gnat and swallow a camel
woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter but within they are full of extortion and excess
thou blind pharisee cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter that the outside of them may be clean also
woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye are like unto whited sepulchres which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead mens bones and of all uncleanness
even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity
woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites because ye build the tombs of the prophets and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous
and say if we had been in the days of our fathers we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets
wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets
fill ye up then the measure of your fathers
ye serpents ye generation of vipers how can ye escape the damnation of hell
wherefore behold i send unto you prophets and wise men and scribes and some of them ye shall kill and crucify and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues and persecute them from city to city
that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth from the blood of righteous abel unto the blood of zacharias son of barachias whom ye slew between the temple and the altar
verily i say unto you all these things shall come upon this generation
o jerusalem jerusalem thou that killest the prophets and stonest them which are sent unto thee how often would i have gathered thy children together even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings and ye would not
behold your house is left unto you desolate
for i say unto you ye shall not see me henceforth till ye shall say blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord
and jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple
and jesus said unto them see ye not all these things verily i say unto you there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down
and as he sat upon the mount of olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world
and jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you
for many shall come in my name saying i am christ and shall deceive many
and ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars see that ye be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet
for nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in divers places
all these are the beginning of sorrows
then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my names sake
and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another
and many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many
and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold
but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved
and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end come
when ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by daniel the prophet stand in the holy place whoso readeth let him understand
then let them which be in judaea flee into the mountains
let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house
neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes
and woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days
but pray ye that your flight be not in the winter neither on the sabbath day
for then shall be great tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time no nor ever shall be
and except those days should be shortened there should no flesh be saved but for the elects sake those days shall be shortened
then if any man shall say unto you lo here is christ or there believe it not
for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall shew great signs and wonders insomuch that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect
behold i have told you before
wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert go not forth behold he is in the secret chambers believe it not
for as the lightning cometh out of the east and shineth even unto the west so shall also the coming of the son of man be
for wheresoever the carcase is there will the eagles be gathered together
immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened and the moon shall not give her light and the stars shall fall from heaven and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken
and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory
and he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds from one end of heaven to the other
now learn a parable of the fig tree when his branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves ye know that summer is nigh
so likewise ye when ye shall see all these things know that it is near even at the doors
verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled
heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away
but of that day and hour knoweth no man no not the angels of heaven but my father only
but as the days of noe were so shall also the coming of the son of man be
for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage until the day that noe entered into the ark
and knew not until the flood came and took them all away so shall also the coming of the son of man be
then shall two be in the field the one shall be taken and the other left
two women shall be grinding at the mill the one shall be taken and the other left
watch therefore for ye know not what hour your lord doth come
but know this that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come he would have watched and would not have suffered his house to be broken up
therefore be ye also ready for in such an hour as ye think not the son of man cometh
who then is a faithful and wise servant whom his lord hath made ruler over his household to give them meat in due season
blessed is that servant whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing
verily i say unto you that he shall make him ruler over all his goods
but and if that evil servant shall say in his heart my lord delayeth his coming
and shall begin to smite his fellowservants and to eat and drink with the drunken
the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him and in an hour that he is not aware of
and shall cut him asunder and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth
then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom
and five of them were wise and five were foolish
they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them
but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps
while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept
and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him
then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps
and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out
but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves
and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut
afterward came also the other virgins saying lord lord open to us
but he answered and said verily i say unto you i know you not
watch therefore for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh
for the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country who called his own servants and delivered unto them his goods
and unto one he gave five talents to another two and to another one to every man according to his several ability and straightway took his journey
then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same and made them other five talents
and likewise he that had received two he also gained other two
but he that had received one went and digged in the earth and hid his lords money
after a long time the lord of those servants cometh and reckoneth with them
and so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents saying lord thou deliveredst unto me five talents behold i have gained beside them five talents more
his lord said unto him well done thou good and faithful servant thou hast been faithful over a few things i will make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of thy lord
he also that had received two talents came and said lord thou deliveredst unto me two talents behold i have gained two other talents beside them
his lord said unto him well done good and faithful servant thou hast been faithful over a few things i will make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of thy lord
then he which had received the one talent came and said lord i knew thee that thou art an hard man reaping where thou hast not sown and gathering where thou hast not strawed
and i was afraid and went and hid thy talent in the earth lo there thou hast that is thine
his lord answered and said unto him thou wicked and slothful servant thou knewest that i reap where i sowed not and gather where i have not strawed
thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers and then at my coming i should have received mine own with usury
take therefore the talent from him and give it unto him which hath ten talents
for unto every one that hath shall be given and he shall have abundance but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath
and cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth
when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory
and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats
and he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on the left
then shall the king say unto them on his right hand come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world
for i was an hungred and ye gave me meat i was thirsty and ye gave me drink i was a stranger and ye took me in
naked and ye clothed me i was sick and ye visited me i was in prison and ye came unto me
then shall the righteous answer him saying lord when saw we thee an hungred and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee drink
when saw we thee a stranger and took thee in or naked and clothed thee
or when saw we thee sick or in prison and came unto thee
and the king shall answer and say unto them verily i say unto you inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me
then shall he say also unto them on the left hand depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels
for i was an hungred and ye gave me no meat i was thirsty and ye gave me no drink
i was a stranger and ye took me not in naked and ye clothed me not sick and in prison and ye visited me not
then shall they also answer him saying lord when saw we thee an hungred or athirst or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister unto thee
then shall he answer them saying verily i say unto you inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these ye did it not to me
and these shall go away into everlasting punishment but the righteous into life eternal
and it came to pass when jesus had finished all these sayings he said unto his disciples
ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover and the son of man is betrayed to be crucified
then assembled together the chief priests and the scribes and the elders of the people unto the palace of the high priest who was called caiaphas
and consulted that they might take jesus by subtilty and kill him
but they said not on the feast day lest there be an uproar among the people
now when jesus was in bethany in the house of simon the leper
there came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment and poured it on his head as he sat at meat
but when his disciples saw it they had indignation saying to what purpose is this waste
for this ointment might have been sold for much and given to the poor
when jesus understood it he said unto them why trouble ye the woman for she hath wrought a good work upon me
for ye have the poor always with you but me ye have not always
for in that she hath poured this ointment on my body she did it for my burial
verily i say unto you wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world there shall also this that this woman hath done be told for a memorial of her
then one of the twelve called judas iscariot went unto the chief priests
and said unto them what will ye give me and i will deliver him unto you and they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver
and from that time he sought opportunity to betray him
now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to jesus saying unto him where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover
and he said go into the city to such a man and say unto him the master saith my time is at hand i will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples
and the disciples did as jesus had appointed them and they made ready the passover
now when the even was come he sat down with the twelve
and as they did eat he said verily i say unto you that one of you shall betray me
and they were exceeding sorrowful and began every one of them to say unto him lord is it i
and he answered and said he that dippeth his hand with me in the dish the same shall betray me
the son of man goeth as it is written of him but woe unto that man by whom the son of man is betrayed it had been good for that man if he had not been born
then judas which betrayed him answered and said master is it i he said unto him thou hast said
and as they were eating jesus took bread and blessed it and brake it and gave it to the disciples and said take eat this is my body
and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying drink ye all of it
for this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins
but i say unto you i will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when i drink it new with you in my fathers kingdom
and when they had sung an hymn they went out into the mount of olives
then saith jesus unto them all ye shall be offended because of me this night for it is written i will smite the shepherd and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad
but after i am risen again i will go before you into galilee
peter answered and said unto him though all men shall be offended because of thee yet will i never be offended
jesus said unto him verily i say unto thee that this night before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice
peter said unto him though i should die with thee yet will i not deny thee likewise also said all the disciples
then cometh jesus with them unto a place called gethsemane and saith unto the disciples sit ye here while i go and pray yonder
and he took with him peter and the two sons of zebedee and began to be sorrowful and very heavy
then saith he unto them my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death tarry ye here and watch with me
and he went a little farther and fell on his face and prayed saying o my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as i will but as thou wilt
and he cometh unto the disciples and findeth them asleep and saith unto peter what could ye not watch with me one hour
watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak
he went away again the second time and prayed saying o my father if this cup may not pass away from me except i drink it thy will be done
and he came and found them asleep again for their eyes were heavy
and he left them and went away again and prayed the third time saying the same words
then cometh he to his disciples and saith unto them sleep on now and take your rest behold the hour is at hand and the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners
rise let us be going behold he is at hand that doth betray me
and while he yet spake lo judas one of the twelve came and with him a great multitude with swords and staves from the chief priests and elders of the people
now he that betrayed him gave them a sign saying whomsoever i shall kiss that same is he hold him fast
and forthwith he came to jesus and said hail master and kissed him
and jesus said unto him friend wherefore art thou come then came they and laid hands on jesus and took him
and behold one of them which were with jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword and struck a servant of the high priests and smote off his ear
then said jesus unto him put up again thy sword into his place for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword
thinkest thou that i cannot now pray to my father and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels
but how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be
in that same hour said jesus to the multitudes are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me i sat daily with you teaching in the temple and ye laid no hold on me
but all this was done that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled then all the disciples forsook him and fled
and they that had laid hold on jesus led him away to caiaphas the high priest where the scribes and the elders were assembled
but peter followed him afar off unto the high priests palace and went in and sat with the servants to see the end
now the chief priests and elders and all the council sought false witness against jesus to put him to death
but found none yea though many false witnesses came yet found they none at the last came two false witnesses
and said this fellow said i am able to destroy the temple of god and to build it in three days
and the high priest arose and said unto him answerest thou nothing what is it which these witness against thee
but jesus held his peace and the high priest answered and said unto him i adjure thee by the living god that thou tell us whether thou be the christ the son of god
jesus saith unto him thou hast said nevertheless i say unto you hereafter shall ye see the son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of heaven
then the high priest rent his clothes saying he hath spoken blasphemy what further need have we of witnesses behold now ye have heard his blasphemy
what think ye they answered and said he is guilty of death
then did they spit in his face and buffeted him and others smote him with the palms of their hands
saying prophesy unto us thou christ who is he that smote thee
now peter sat without in the palace and a damsel came unto him saying thou also wast with jesus of galilee
but he denied before them all saying i know not what thou sayest
and when he was gone out into the porch another maid saw him and said unto them that were there this fellow was also with jesus of nazareth
and again he denied with an oath i do not know the man
and after a while came unto him they that stood by and said to peter surely thou also art one of them for thy speech bewrayeth thee
then began he to curse and to swear saying i know not the man and immediately the cock crew
and peter remembered the word of jesus which said unto him before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice and he went out and wept bitterly
when the morning was come all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against jesus to put him to death
and when they had bound him they led him away and delivered him to pontius pilate the governor
then judas which had betrayed him when he saw that he was condemned repented himself and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders
saying i have sinned in that i have betrayed the innocent blood and they said what is that to us see thou to that
and he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed and went and hanged himself
and the chief priests took the silver pieces and said it is not lawful for to put them into the treasury because it is the price of blood
and they took counsel and bought with them the potters field to bury strangers in
wherefore that field was called the field of blood unto this day
then was fulfilled that which was spoken by jeremy the prophet saying and they took the thirty pieces of silver the price of him that was valued whom they of the children of israel did value
and gave them for the potters field as the lord appointed me
and jesus stood before the governor and the governor asked him saying art thou the king of the jews and jesus said unto him thou sayest
and when he was accused of the chief priests and elders he answered nothing
then said pilate unto him hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee
and he answered him to never a word insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly
now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner whom they would
and they had then a notable prisoner called barabbas
therefore when they were gathered together pilate said unto them whom will ye that i release unto you barabbas or jesus which is called christ
for he knew that for envy they had delivered him
when he was set down on the judgment seat his wife sent unto him saying have thou nothing to do with that just man for i have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him
but the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask barabbas and destroy jesus
the governor answered and said unto them whether of the twain will ye that i release unto you they said barabbas
pilate saith unto them what shall i do then with jesus which is called christ they all say unto him let him be crucified
and the governor said why what evil hath he done but they cried out the more saying let him be crucified
when pilate saw that he could prevail nothing but that rather a tumult was made he took water and washed his hands before the multitude saying i am innocent of the blood of this just person see ye to it
then answered all the people and said his blood be on us and on our children
then released he barabbas unto them and when he had scourged jesus he delivered him to be crucified
then the soldiers of the governor took jesus into the common hall and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers
and they stripped him and put on him a scarlet robe
and when they had platted a crown of thorns they put it upon his head and a reed in his right hand and they bowed the knee before him and mocked him saying hail king of the jews
and they spit upon him and took the reed and smote him on the head
and after that they had mocked him they took the robe off from him and put his own raiment on him and led him away to crucify him
and as they came out they found a man of cyrene simon by name him they compelled to bear his cross
and when they were come unto a place called golgotha that is to say a place of a skull
they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall and when he had tasted thereof he would not drink
and they crucified him and parted his garments casting lots that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet they parted my garments among them and upon my vesture did they cast lots
and sitting down they watched him there
and set up over his head his accusation written this is jesus the king of the jews
then were there two thieves crucified with him one on the right hand and another on the left
and they that passed by reviled him wagging their heads
and saying thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it in three days save thyself if thou be the son of god come down from the cross
likewise also the chief priests mocking him with the scribes and elders said
he saved others himself he cannot save if he be the king of israel let him now come down from the cross and we will believe him
he trusted in god let him deliver him now if he will have him for he said i am the son of god
the thieves also which were crucified with him cast the same in his teeth
now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour
and about the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice saying eli eli lama sabachthani that is to say my god my god why hast thou forsaken me
some of them that stood there when they heard that said this man calleth for elias
and straightway one of them ran and took a spunge and filled it with vinegar and put it on a reed and gave him to drink
the rest said let be let us see whether elias will come to save him
jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice yielded up the ghost
and behold the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom and the earth did quake and the rocks rent
and the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints which slept arose
and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many
now when the centurion and they that were with him watching jesus saw the earthquake and those things that were done they feared greatly saying truly this was the son of god
and many women were there beholding afar off which followed jesus from galilee ministering unto him
among which was mary magdalene and mary the mother of james and joses and the mother of zebedees children
when the even was come there came a rich man of arimathaea named joseph who also himself was jesus disciple
he went to pilate and begged the body of jesus then pilate commanded the body to be delivered
and when joseph had taken the body he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth
and laid it in his own new tomb which he had hewn out in the rock and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre and departed
and there was mary magdalene and the other mary sitting over against the sepulchre
now the next day that followed the day of the preparation the chief priests and pharisees came together unto pilate
saying sir we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive after three days i will rise again
command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day lest his disciples come by night and steal him away and say unto the people he is risen from the dead so the last error shall be worse than the first
pilate said unto them ye have a watch go your way make it as sure as ye can
so they went and made the sepulchre sure sealing the stone and setting a watch
in the end of the sabbath as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week came mary magdalene and the other mary to see the sepulchre
and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door and sat upon it
his countenance was like lightning and his raiment white as snow
and for fear of him the keepers did shake and became as dead men
and the angel answered and said unto the women fear not ye for i know that ye seek jesus which was crucified
he is not here for he is risen as he said come see the place where the lord lay
and go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead and behold he goeth before you into galilee there shall ye see him lo i have told you
and they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy and did run to bring his disciples word
and as they went to tell his disciples behold jesus met them saying all hail and they came and held him by the feet and worshipped him
then said jesus unto them be not afraid go tell my brethren that they go into galilee and there shall they see me
now when they were going behold some of the watch came into the city and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done
and when they were assembled with the elders and had taken counsel they gave large money unto the soldiers
saying say ye his disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept
and if this come to the governors ears we will persuade him and secure you
so they took the money and did as they were taught and this saying is commonly reported among the jews until this day
then the eleven disciples went away into galilee into a mountain where jesus had appointed them
and when they saw him they worshipped him but some doubted
and jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth
go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost
teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you and lo i am with you alway even unto the end of the world amen
forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us
even as they delivered them unto us which from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word
it seemed good to me also having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first to write unto thee in order most excellent theophilus
that thou mightest know the certainty of those things wherein thou hast been instructed
there was in the days of herod the king of judaea a certain priest named zacharias of the course of abia and his wife was of the daughters of aaron and her name was elisabeth
and they were both righteous before god walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the lord blameless
and they had no child because that elisabeth was barren and they both were now well stricken in years
and it came to pass that while he executed the priests office before god in the order of his course
according to the custom of the priests office his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the lord
and the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense
and there appeared unto him an angel of the lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense
and when zacharias saw him he was troubled and fear fell upon him
but the angel said unto him fear not zacharias for thy prayer is heard and thy wife elisabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name john
and thou shalt have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth
for he shall be great in the sight of the lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink and he shall be filled with the holy ghost even from his mothers womb
and many of the children of israel shall he turn to the lord their god
and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the lord
and zacharias said unto the angel whereby shall i know this for i am an old man and my wife well stricken in years
and the angel answering said unto him i am gabriel that stand in the presence of god and am sent to speak unto thee and to shew thee these glad tidings
and behold thou shalt be dumb and not able to speak until the day that these things shall be performed because thou believest not my words which shall be fulfilled in their season
and the people waited for zacharias and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple
and when he came out he could not speak unto them and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple for he beckoned unto them and remained speechless
and it came to pass that as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished he departed to his own house
and after those days his wife elisabeth conceived and hid herself five months saying
thus hath the lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me to take away my reproach among men
and in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god unto a city of galilee named nazareth
to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was joseph of the house of david and the virgins name was mary
and the angel came in unto her and said hail thou that art highly favoured the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women
and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be
and the angel said unto her fear not mary for thou hast found favour with god
and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shalt call his name jesus
he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david
and he shall reign over the house of jacob for ever and of his kingdom there shall be no end
then said mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing i know not a man
and the angel answered and said unto her the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god
and behold thy cousin elisabeth she hath also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren
for with god nothing shall be impossible
and mary said behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her
and mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste into a city of juda
and entered into the house of zacharias and saluted elisabeth
and it came to pass that when elisabeth heard the salutation of mary the babe leaped in her womb and elisabeth was filled with the holy ghost
and she spake out with a loud voice and said blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb
and whence is this to me that the mother of my lord should come to me
for lo as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears the babe leaped in my womb for joy
and blessed is she that believed for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the lord
and mary said my soul doth magnify the lord
and my spirit hath rejoiced in god my saviour
for he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed
for he that is mighty hath done to me great things and holy is his name
and his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation
he hath shewed strength with his arm he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts
he hath put down the mighty from their seats and exalted them of low degree
he hath filled the hungry with good things and the rich he hath sent empty away
he hath holpen his servant israel in remembrance of his mercy
as he spake to our fathers to abraham and to his seed for ever
and mary abode with her about three months and returned to her own house
now elisabeths full time came that she should be delivered and she brought forth a son
and her neighbours and her cousins heard how the lord had shewed great mercy upon her and they rejoiced with her
and it came to pass that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child and they called him zacharias after the name of his father
and his mother answered and said not so but he shall be called john
and they said unto her there is none of thy kindred that is called by this name
and they made signs to his father how he would have him called
and he asked for a writing table and wrote saying his name is john and they marvelled all
and his mouth was opened immediately and his tongue loosed and he spake and praised god
and fear came on all that dwelt round about them and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of judaea
and all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts saying what manner of child shall this be and the hand of the lord was with him
and his father zacharias was filled with the holy ghost and prophesied saying
blessed be the lord god of israel for he hath visited and redeemed his people
and hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant david
as he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets which have been since the world began
that we should be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all that hate us
to perform the mercy promised to our fathers and to remember his holy covenant
the oath which he sware to our father abraham
that he would grant unto us that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear
in holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life
and thou child shalt be called the prophet of the highest for thou shalt go before the face of the lord to prepare his ways
to give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins
through the tender mercy of our god whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us
to give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death to guide our feet into the way of peace
and the child grew and waxed strong in spirit and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto israel
and it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from caesar augustus that all the world should be taxed
and this taxing was first made when cyrenius was governor of syria
and all went to be taxed every one into his own city
and joseph also went up from galilee out of the city of nazareth into judaea unto the city of david which is called bethlehem because he was of the house and lineage of david
to be taxed with mary his espoused wife being great with child
and so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered
and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the inn
and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night
and lo the angel of the lord came upon them and the glory of the lord shone round about them and they were sore afraid
and the angel said unto them fear not for behold i bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people
for unto you is born this day in the city of david a saviour which is christ the lord
and this shall be a sign unto you ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger
and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising god and saying
glory to god in the highest and on earth peace good will toward men
and it came to pass as the angels were gone away from them into heaven the shepherds said one to another let us now go even unto bethlehem and see this thing which is come to pass which the lord hath made known unto us
and they came with haste and found mary and joseph and the babe lying in a manger
and when they had seen it they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child
and all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds
but mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart
and the shepherds returned glorifying and praising god for all the things that they had heard and seen as it was told unto them
and when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child his name was called jesus which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb
and when the days of her purification according to the law of moses were accomplished they brought him to jerusalem to present him to the lord
as it is written in the law of the lord every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the lord
and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the lord a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons
and behold there was a man in jerusalem whose name was simeon and the same man was just and devout waiting for the consolation of israel and the holy ghost was upon him
and it was revealed unto him by the holy ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the lords christ
and he came by the spirit into the temple and when the parents brought in the child jesus to do for him after the custom of the law
then took he him up in his arms and blessed god and said
lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace according to thy word
for mine eyes have seen thy salvation
which thou hast prepared before the face of all people
a light to lighten the gentiles and the glory of thy people israel
and joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him
and simeon blessed them and said unto mary his mother behold this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in israel and for a sign which shall be spoken against
yea a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed
and there was one anna a prophetess the daughter of phanuel of the tribe of aser she was of a great age and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity
and she was a widow of about fourscore and four years which departed not from the temple but served god with fastings and prayers night and day
and she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the lord and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in jerusalem
and when they had performed all things according to the law of the lord they returned into galilee to their own city nazareth
and the child grew and waxed strong in spirit filled with wisdom and the grace of god was upon him
now his parents went to jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover
and when he was twelve years old they went up to jerusalem after the custom of the feast
and when they had fulfilled the days as they returned the child jesus tarried behind in jerusalem and joseph and his mother knew not of it
but they supposing him to have been in the company went a days journey and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance
and when they found him not they turned back again to jerusalem seeking him
and it came to pass that after three days they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the doctors both hearing them and asking them questions
and all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers
and when they saw him they were amazed and his mother said unto him son why hast thou thus dealt with us behold thy father and i have sought thee sorrowing
and he said unto them how is it that ye sought me wist ye not that i must be about my fathers business
and they understood not the saying which he spake unto them
and he went down with them and came to nazareth and was subject unto them but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart
and jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favour with god and man
now in the fifteenth year of the reign of tiberius caesar pontius pilate being governor of judaea and herod being tetrarch of galilee and his brother philip tetrarch of ituraea and of the region of trachonitis and lysanias the tetrarch of abilene
annas and caiaphas being the high priests the word of god came unto john the son of zacharias in the wilderness
and he came into all the country about jordan preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins
as it is written in the book of the words of esaias the prophet saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make his paths straight
every valley shall be filled and every mountain and hill shall be brought low and the crooked shall be made straight and the rough ways shall be made smooth
and all flesh shall see the salvation of god
then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him o generation of vipers who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come
bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance and begin not to say within yourselves we have abraham to our father for i say unto you that god is able of these stones to raise up children unto abraham
and now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire
and the people asked him saying what shall we do then
he answereth and saith unto them he that hath two coats let him impart to him that hath none and he that hath meat let him do likewise
then came also publicans to be baptized and said unto him master what shall we do
and he said unto them exact no more than that which is appointed you
and the soldiers likewise demanded of him saying and what shall we do and he said unto them do violence to no man neither accuse any falsely and be content with your wages
and as the people were in expectation and all men mused in their hearts of john whether he were the christ or not
john answered saying unto them all i indeed baptize you with water but one mightier than i cometh the latchet of whose shoes i am not worthy to unloose he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire
whose fan is in his hand and he will throughly purge his floor and will gather the wheat into his garner but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable
and many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the people
but herod the tetrarch being reproved by him for herodias his brother philips wife and for all the evils which herod had done
added yet this above all that he shut up john in prison
now when all the people were baptized it came to pass that jesus also being baptized and praying the heaven was opened
and the holy ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him and a voice came from heaven which said thou art my beloved son in thee i am well pleased
and jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age being as was supposed the son of joseph which was the son of heli
which was the son of matthat which was the son of levi which was the son of melchi which was the son of janna which was the son of joseph
which was the son of mattathias which was the son of amos which was the son of naum which was the son of esli which was the son of nagge
which was the son of maath which was the son of mattathias which was the son of semei which was the son of joseph which was the son of juda
which was the son of joanna which was the son of rhesa which was the son of zorobabel which was the son of salathiel which was the son of neri
which was the son of melchi which was the son of addi which was the son of cosam which was the son of elmodam which was the son of er
which was the son of jose which was the son of eliezer which was the son of jorim which was the son of matthat which was the son of levi
which was the son of simeon which was the son of juda which was the son of joseph which was the son of jonan which was the son of eliakim
which was the son of melea which was the son of menan which was the son of mattatha which was the son of nathan which was the son of david
which was the son of jesse which was the son of obed which was the son of booz which was the son of salmon which was the son of naasson
which was the son of aminadab which was the son of aram which was the son of esrom which was the son of phares which was the son of juda
which was the son of jacob which was the son of isaac which was the son of abraham which was the son of thara which was the son of nachor
which was the son of saruch which was the son of ragau which was the son of phalec which was the son of heber which was the son of sala
which was the son of cainan which was the son of arphaxad which was the son of sem which was the son of noe which was the son of lamech
which was the son of mathusala which was the son of enoch which was the son of jared which was the son of maleleel which was the son of cainan
which was the son of enos which was the son of seth which was the son of adam which was the son of god
and jesus being full of the holy ghost returned from jordan and was led by the spirit into the wilderness
being forty days tempted of the devil and in those days he did eat nothing and when they were ended he afterward hungered
and the devil said unto him if thou be the son of god command this stone that it be made bread
and jesus answered him saying it is written that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of god
and the devil taking him up into an high mountain shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time
and the devil said unto him all this power will i give thee and the glory of them for that is delivered unto me and to whomsoever i will i give it
if thou therefore wilt worship me all shall be thine
and jesus answered and said unto him get thee behind me satan for it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve
and he brought him to jerusalem and set him on a pinnacle of the temple and said unto him if thou be the son of god cast thyself down from hence
for it is written he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee
and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone
and jesus answering said unto him it is said thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god
and when the devil had ended all the temptation he departed from him for a season
and jesus returned in the power of the spirit into galilee and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about
and he taught in their synagogues being glorified of all
and he came to nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and stood up for to read
and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet esaias and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written
the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised
to preach the acceptable year of the lord
and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him
and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears
and all bare him witness and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth and they said is not this josephs son
and he said unto them ye will surely say unto me this proverb physician heal thyself whatsoever we have heard done in capernaum do also here in thy country
and he said verily i say unto you no prophet is accepted in his own country
but i tell you of a truth many widows were in israel in the days of elias when the heaven was shut up three years and six months when great famine was throughout all the land
but unto none of them was elias sent save unto sarepta a city of sidon unto a woman that was a widow
and many lepers were in israel in the time of eliseus the prophet and none of them was cleansed saving naaman the syrian
and all they in the synagogue when they heard these things were filled with wrath
and rose up and thrust him out of the city and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built that they might cast him down headlong
but he passing through the midst of them went his way
and came down to capernaum a city of galilee and taught them on the sabbath days
and they were astonished at his doctrine for his word was with power
and in the synagogue there was a man which had a spirit of an unclean devil and cried out with a loud voice
saying let us alone what have we to do with thee thou jesus of nazareth art thou come to destroy us i know thee who thou art the holy one of god
and jesus rebuked him saying hold thy peace and come out of him and when the devil had thrown him in the midst he came out of him and hurt him not
and they were all amazed and spake among themselves saying what a word is this for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits and they come out
and the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about
and he arose out of the synagogue and entered into simons house and simons wifes mother was taken with a great fever and they besought him for her
and he stood over her and rebuked the fever and it left her and immediately she arose and ministered unto them
now when the sun was setting all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him and he laid his hands on every one of them and healed them
and devils also came out of many crying out and saying thou art christ the son of god and he rebuking them suffered them not to speak for they knew that he was christ
and when it was day he departed and went into a desert place and the people sought him and came unto him and stayed him that he should not depart from them
and he said unto them i must preach the kingdom of god to other cities also for therefore am i sent
and he preached in the synagogues of galilee
and it came to pass that as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of god he stood by the lake of gennesaret
and saw two ships standing by the lake but the fishermen were gone out of them and were washing their nets
and he entered into one of the ships which was simons and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land and he sat down and taught the people out of the ship
now when he had left speaking he said unto simon launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a draught
and simon answering said unto him master we have toiled all the night and have taken nothing nevertheless at thy word i will let down the net
and when they had this done they inclosed a great multitude of fishes and their net brake
and they beckoned unto their partners which were in the other ship that they should come and help them and they came and filled both the ships so that they began to sink
when simon peter saw it he fell down at jesus knees saying depart from me for i am a sinful man o lord
for he was astonished and all that were with him at the draught of the fishes which they had taken
and so was also james and john the sons of zebedee which were partners with simon and jesus said unto simon fear not from henceforth thou shalt catch men
and when they had brought their ships to land they forsook all and followed him
and it came to pass when he was in a certain city behold a man full of leprosy who seeing jesus fell on his face and besought him saying lord if thou wilt thou canst make me clean
and he put forth his hand and touched him saying i will be thou clean and immediately the leprosy departed from him
and he charged him to tell no man but go and shew thyself to the priest and offer for thy cleansing according as moses commanded for a testimony unto them
but so much the more went there a fame abroad of him and great multitudes came together to hear and to be healed by him of their infirmities
and he withdrew himself into the wilderness and prayed
and it came to pass on a certain day as he was teaching that there were pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by which were come out of every town of galilee and judaea and jerusalem and the power of the lord was present to heal them
and behold men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy and they sought means to bring him in and to lay him before him
and when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude they went upon the housetop and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before jesus
and when he saw their faith he said unto him man thy sins are forgiven thee
and the scribes and the pharisees began to reason saying who is this which speaketh blasphemies who can forgive sins but god alone
but when jesus perceived their thoughts he answering said unto them what reason ye in your hearts
whether is easier to say thy sins be forgiven thee or to say rise up and walk
but that ye may know that the son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins he said unto the sick of the palsy i say unto thee arise and take up thy couch and go into thine house
and immediately he rose up before them and took up that whereon he lay and departed to his own house glorifying god
and they were all amazed and they glorified god and were filled with fear saying we have seen strange things to day
and after these things he went forth and saw a publican named levi sitting at the receipt of custom and he said unto him follow me
and he left all rose up and followed him
and levi made him a great feast in his own house and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them
but their scribes and pharisees murmured against his disciples saying why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners
and jesus answering said unto them they that are whole need not a physician but they that are sick
i came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance
and they said unto him why do the disciples of john fast often and make prayers and likewise the disciples of the pharisees but thine eat and drink
and he said unto them can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them
but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them and then shall they fast in those days
and he spake also a parable unto them no man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old if otherwise then both the new maketh a rent and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the old
and no man putteth new wine into old bottles else the new wine will burst the bottles and be spilled and the bottles shall perish
but new wine must be put into new bottles and both are preserved
no man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new for he saith the old is better
and it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first that he went through the corn fields and his disciples plucked the ears of corn and did eat rubbing them in their hands
and certain of the pharisees said unto them why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days
and jesus answering them said have ye not read so much as this what david did when himself was an hungred and they which were with him
how he went into the house of god and did take and eat the shewbread and gave also to them that were with him which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone
and he said unto them that the son of man is lord also of the sabbath
and it came to pass also on another sabbath that he entered into the synagogue and taught and there was a man whose right hand was withered
and the scribes and pharisees watched him whether he would heal on the sabbath day that they might find an accusation against him
but he knew their thoughts and said to the man which had the withered hand rise up and stand forth in the midst and he arose and stood forth
then said jesus unto them i will ask you one thing is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good or to do evil to save life or to destroy it
and looking round about upon them all he said unto the man stretch forth thy hand and he did so and his hand was restored whole as the other
and they were filled with madness and communed one with another what they might do to jesus
and it came to pass in those days that he went out into a mountain to pray and continued all night in prayer to god
and when it was day he called unto him his disciples and of them he chose twelve whom also he named apostles
simon whom he also named peter and andrew his brother james and john philip and bartholomew
matthew and thomas james the son of alphaeus and simon called zelotes
and judas the brother of james and judas iscariot which also was the traitor
and he came down with them and stood in the plain and the company of his disciples and a great multitude of people out of all judaea and jerusalem and from the sea coast of tyre and sidon which came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases
and they that were vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed
and the whole multitude sought to touch him for there went virtue out of him and healed them all
and he lifted up his eyes on his disciples and said blessed be ye poor for yours is the kingdom of god
blessed are ye that hunger now for ye shall be filled blessed are ye that weep now for ye shall laugh
blessed are ye when men shall hate you and when they shall separate you from their company and shall reproach you and cast out your name as evil for the son of mans sake
rejoice ye in that day and leap for joy for behold your reward is great in heaven for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets
but woe unto you that are rich for ye have received your consolation
woe unto you that are full for ye shall hunger woe unto you that laugh now for ye shall mourn and weep
woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you for so did their fathers to the false prophets
but i say unto you which hear love your enemies do good to them which hate you
bless them that curse you and pray for them which despitefully use you
and unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also
give to every man that asketh of thee and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again
and as ye would that men should do to you do ye also to them likewise
for if ye love them which love you what thank have ye for sinners also love those that love them
and if ye do good to them which do good to you what thank have ye for sinners also do even the same
and if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive what thank have ye for sinners also lend to sinners to receive as much again
but love ye your enemies and do good and lend hoping for nothing again and your reward shall be great and ye shall be the children of the highest for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil
be ye therefore merciful as your father also is merciful
judge not and ye shall not be judged condemn not and ye shall not be condemned forgive and ye shall be forgiven
give and it shall be given unto you good measure pressed down and shaken together and running over shall men give into your bosom for with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again
and he spake a parable unto them can the blind lead the blind shall they not both fall into the ditch
the disciple is not above his master but every one that is perfect shall be as his master
and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brothers eye but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye
either how canst thou say to thy brother brother let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye thou hypocrite cast out first the beam out of thine own eye and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brothers eye
for a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit
for every tree is known by his own fruit for of thorns men do not gather figs nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes
a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh
and why call ye me lord lord and do not the things which i say
whosoever cometh to me and heareth my sayings and doeth them i will shew you to whom he is like
he is like a man which built an house and digged deep and laid the foundation on a rock and when the flood arose the stream beat vehemently upon that house and could not shake it for it was founded upon a rock
but he that heareth and doeth not is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth against which the stream did beat vehemently and immediately it fell and the ruin of that house was great
now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people he entered into capernaum
and a certain centurions servant who was dear unto him was sick and ready to die
and when he heard of jesus he sent unto him the elders of the jews beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant
and when they came to jesus they besought him instantly saying that he was worthy for whom he should do this
for he loveth our nation and he hath built us a synagogue
then jesus went with them and when he was now not far from the house the centurion sent friends to him saying unto him lord trouble not thyself for i am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof
wherefore neither thought i myself worthy to come unto thee but say in a word and my servant shall be healed
for i also am a man set under authority having under me soldiers and i say unto one go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he doeth it
when jesus heard these things he marvelled at him and turned him about and said unto the people that followed him i say unto you i have not found so great faith no not in israel
and they that were sent returning to the house found the servant whole that had been sick
and it came to pass the day after that he went into a city called nain and many of his disciples went with him and much people
now when he came nigh to the gate of the city behold there was a dead man carried out the only son of his mother and she was a widow and much people of the city was with her
and when the lord saw her he had compassion on her and said unto her weep not
and he came and touched the bier and they that bare him stood still and he said young man i say unto thee arise
and he that was dead sat up and began to speak and he delivered him to his mother
and there came a fear on all and they glorified god saying that a great prophet is risen up among us and that god hath visited his people
and this rumour of him went forth throughout all judaea and throughout all the region round about
and the disciples of john shewed him of all these things
and john calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to jesus saying art thou he that should come or look we for another
when the men were come unto him they said john baptist hath sent us unto thee saying art thou he that should come or look we for another
and in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues and of evil spirits and unto many that were blind he gave sight
then jesus answering said unto them go your way and tell john what things ye have seen and heard how that the blind see the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the deaf hear the dead are raised to the poor the gospel is preached
and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me
and when the messengers of john were departed he began to speak unto the people concerning john what went ye out into the wilderness for to see a reed shaken with the wind
but what went ye out for to see a man clothed in soft raiment behold they which are gorgeously apparelled and live delicately are in kings courts
but what went ye out for to see a prophet yea i say unto you and much more than a prophet
this is he of whom it is written behold i send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee
for i say unto you among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than john the baptist but he that is least in the kingdom of god is greater than he
and all the people that heard him and the publicans justified god being baptized with the baptism of john
but the pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of god against themselves being not baptized of him
and the lord said whereunto then shall i liken the men of this generation and to what are they like
they are like unto children sitting in the marketplace and calling one to another and saying we have piped unto you and ye have not danced we have mourned to you and ye have not wept
for john the baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine and ye say he hath a devil
the son of man is come eating and drinking and ye say behold a gluttonous man and a winebibber a friend of publicans and sinners
but wisdom is justified of all her children
and one of the pharisees desired him that he would eat with him and he went into the pharisees house and sat down to meat
and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that jesus sat at meat in the pharisees house brought an alabaster box of ointment
and stood at his feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with tears and did wipe them with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment
now when the pharisee which had bidden him saw it he spake within himself saying this man if he were a prophet would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him for she is a sinner
and jesus answering said unto him simon i have somewhat to say unto thee and he saith master say on
there was a certain creditor which had two debtors the one owed five hundred pence and the other fifty
and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both tell me therefore which of them will love him most
simon answered and said i suppose that he to whom he forgave most and he said unto him thou hast rightly judged
and he turned to the woman and said unto simon seest thou this woman i entered into thine house thou gavest me no water for my feet but she hath washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head
thou gavest me no kiss but this woman since the time i came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet
my head with oil thou didst not anoint but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment
wherefore i say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little is forgiven the same loveth little
and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven
and they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves who is this that forgiveth sins also
and he said to the woman thy faith hath saved thee go in peace
and it came to pass afterward that he went throughout every city and village preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of god and the twelve were with him
and certain women which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities mary called magdalene out of whom went seven devils
and joanna the wife of chuza herods steward and susanna and many others which ministered unto him of their substance
and when much people were gathered together and were come to him out of every city he spake by a parable
a sower went out to sow his seed and as he sowed some fell by the way side and it was trodden down and the fowls of the air devoured it
and some fell upon a rock and as soon as it was sprung up it withered away because it lacked moisture
and some fell among thorns and the thorns sprang up with it and choked it
and other fell on good ground and sprang up and bare fruit an hundredfold and when he had said these things he cried he that hath ears to hear let him hear
and his disciples asked him saying what might this parable be
and he said unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of god but to others in parables that seeing they might not see and hearing they might not understand
now the parable is this the seed is the word of god
those by the way side are they that hear then cometh the devil and taketh away the word out of their hearts lest they should believe and be saved
they on the rock are they which when they hear receive the word with joy and these have no root which for a while believe and in time of temptation fall away
and that which fell among thorns are they which when they have heard go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to perfection
but that on the good ground are they which in an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience
no man when he hath lighted a candle covereth it with a vessel or putteth it under a bed but setteth it on a candlestick that they which enter in may see the light
for nothing is secret that shall not be made manifest neither any thing hid that shall not be known and come abroad
take heed therefore how ye hear for whosoever hath to him shall be given and whosoever hath not from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have
then came to him his mother and his brethren and could not come at him for the press
and it was told him by certain which said thy mother and thy brethren stand without desiring to see thee
and he answered and said unto them my mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of god and do it
now it came to pass on a certain day that he went into a ship with his disciples and he said unto them let us go over unto the other side of the lake and they launched forth
but as they sailed he fell asleep and there came down a storm of wind on the lake and they were filled with water and were in jeopardy
and they came to him and awoke him saying master master we perish then he arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water and they ceased and there was a calm
and he said unto them where is your faith and they being afraid wondered saying one to another what manner of man is this for he commandeth even the winds and water and they obey him
and they arrived at the country of the gadarenes which is over against galilee
and when he went forth to land there met him out of the city a certain man which had devils long time and ware no clothes neither abode in any house but in the tombs
when he saw jesus he cried out and fell down before him and with a loud voice said what have i to do with thee jesus thou son of god most high i beseech thee torment me not
for he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man for oftentimes it had caught him and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters and he brake the bands and was driven of the devil into the wilderness
and jesus asked him saying what is thy name and he said legion because many devils were entered into him
and they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep
and there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them and he suffered them
then went the devils out of the man and entered into the swine and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake and were choked
when they that fed them saw what was done they fled and went and told it in the city and in the country
then they went out to see what was done and came to jesus and found the man out of whom the devils were departed sitting at the feet of jesus clothed and in his right mind and they were afraid
they also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed
then the whole multitude of the country of the gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them for they were taken with great fear and he went up into the ship and returned back again
now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him but jesus sent him away saying
return to thine own house and shew how great things god hath done unto thee and he went his way and published throughout the whole city how great things jesus had done unto him
and it came to pass that when jesus was returned the people gladly received him for they were all waiting for him
and behold there came a man named jairus and he was a ruler of the synagogue and he fell down at jesus feet and besought him that he would come into his house
for he had one only daughter about twelve years of age and she lay a dying but as he went the people thronged him
and a woman having an issue of blood twelve years which had spent all her living upon physicians neither could be healed of any
came behind him and touched the border of his garment and immediately her issue of blood stanched
and jesus said who touched me when all denied peter and they that were with him said master the multitude throng thee and press thee and sayest thou who touched me
and jesus said somebody hath touched me for i perceive that virtue is gone out of me
and when the woman saw that she was not hid she came trembling and falling down before him she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him and how she was healed immediately
and he said unto her daughter be of good comfort thy faith hath made thee whole go in peace
while he yet spake there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogues house saying to him thy daughter is dead trouble not the master
but when jesus heard it he answered him saying fear not believe only and she shall be made whole
and when he came into the house he suffered no man to go in save peter and james and john and the father and the mother of the maiden
and all wept and bewailed her but he said weep not she is not dead but sleepeth
and they laughed him to scorn knowing that she was dead
and he put them all out and took her by the hand and called saying maid arise
and her spirit came again and she arose straightway and he commanded to give her meat
and her parents were astonished but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done
then he called his twelve disciples together and gave them power and authority over all devils and to cure diseases
and he sent them to preach the kingdom of god and to heal the sick
and he said unto them take nothing for your journey neither staves nor scrip neither bread neither money neither have two coats apiece
and whatsoever house ye enter into there abide and thence depart
and whosoever will not receive you when ye go out of that city shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them
and they departed and went through the towns preaching the gospel and healing every where
now herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him and he was perplexed because that it was said of some that john was risen from the dead
and of some that elias had appeared and of others that one of the old prophets was risen again
and herod said john have i beheaded but who is this of whom i hear such things and he desired to see him
and the apostles when they were returned told him all that they had done and he took them and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called bethsaida
and the people when they knew it followed him and he received them and spake unto them of the kingdom of god and healed them that had need of healing
and when the day began to wear away then came the twelve and said unto him send the multitude away that they may go into the towns and country round about and lodge and get victuals for we are here in a desert place
but he said unto them give ye them to eat and they said we have no more but five loaves and two fishes except we should go and buy meat for all this people
for they were about five thousand men and he said to his disciples make them sit down by fifties in a company
and they did so and made them all sit down
then he took the five loaves and the two fishes and looking up to heaven he blessed them and brake and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude
and they did eat and were all filled and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets
and it came to pass as he was alone praying his disciples were with him and he asked them saying whom say the people that i am
they answering said john the baptist but some say elias and others say that one of the old prophets is risen again
he said unto them but whom say ye that i am peter answering said the christ of god
and he straitly charged them and commanded them to tell no man that thing
saying the son of man must suffer many things and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be slain and be raised the third day
and he said to them all if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me
for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever will lose his life for my sake the same shall save it
for what is a man advantaged if he gain the whole world and lose himself or be cast away
for whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words of him shall the son of man be ashamed when he shall come in his own glory and in his fathers and of the holy angels
but i tell you of a truth there be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the kingdom of god
and it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings he took peter and john and james and went up into a mountain to pray
and as he prayed the fashion of his countenance was altered and his raiment was white and glistering
and behold there talked with him two men which were moses and elias
who appeared in glory and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at jerusalem
but peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep and when they were awake they saw his glory and the two men that stood with him
and it came to pass as they departed from him peter said unto jesus master it is good for us to be here and let us make three tabernacles one for thee and one for moses and one for elias not knowing what he said
while he thus spake there came a cloud and overshadowed them and they feared as they entered into the cloud
and there came a voice out of the cloud saying this is my beloved son hear him
and when the voice was past jesus was found alone and they kept it close and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen
and it came to pass that on the next day when they were come down from the hill much people met him
and behold a man of the company cried out saying master i beseech thee look upon my son for he is mine only child
and lo a spirit taketh him and he suddenly crieth out and it teareth him that he foameth again and bruising him hardly departeth from him
and i besought thy disciples to cast him out and they could not
and jesus answering said o faithless and perverse generation how long shall i be with you and suffer you bring thy son hither
and as he was yet a coming the devil threw him down and tare him and jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the child and delivered him again to his father
and they were all amazed at the mighty power of god but while they wondered every one at all things which jesus did he said unto his disciples
let these sayings sink down into your ears for the son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men
but they understood not this saying and it was hid from them that they perceived it not and they feared to ask him of that saying
then there arose a reasoning among them which of them should be greatest
and jesus perceiving the thought of their heart took a child and set him by him
and said unto them whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me for he that is least among you all the same shall be great
and john answered and said master we saw one casting out devils in thy name and we forbad him because he followeth not with us
and jesus said unto him forbid him not for he that is not against us is for us
and it came to pass when the time was come that he should be received up he stedfastly set his face to go to jerusalem
and sent messengers before his face and they went and entered into a village of the samaritans to make ready for him
and they did not receive him because his face was as though he would go to jerusalem
and when his disciples james and john saw this they said lord wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume them even as elias did
but he turned and rebuked them and said ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of
for the son of man is not come to destroy mens lives but to save them and they went to another village
and it came to pass that as they went in the way a certain man said unto him lord i will follow thee whithersoever thou goest
and jesus said unto him foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests but the son of man hath not where to lay his head
and he said unto another follow me but he said lord suffer me first to go and bury my father
jesus said unto him let the dead bury their dead but go thou and preach the kingdom of god
and another also said lord i will follow thee but let me first go bid them farewell which are at home at my house
and jesus said unto him no man having put his hand to the plough and looking back is fit for the kingdom of god
after these things the lord appointed other seventy also and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place whither he himself would come
therefore said he unto them the harvest truly is great but the labourers are few pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest that he would send forth labourers into his harvest
go your ways behold i send you forth as lambs among wolves
carry neither purse nor scrip nor shoes and salute no man by the way
and into whatsoever house ye enter first say peace be to this house
and if the son of peace be there your peace shall rest upon it if not it shall turn to you again
and in the same house remain eating and drinking such things as they give for the labourer is worthy of his hire go not from house to house
and into whatsoever city ye enter and they receive you eat such things as are set before you
and heal the sick that are therein and say unto them the kingdom of god is come nigh unto you
but into whatsoever city ye enter and they receive you not go your ways out into the streets of the same and say
even the very dust of your city which cleaveth on us we do wipe off against you notwithstanding be ye sure of this that the kingdom of god is come nigh unto you
but i say unto you that it shall be more tolerable in that day for sodom than for that city
woe unto thee chorazin woe unto thee bethsaida for if the mighty works had been done in tyre and sidon which have been done in you they had a great while ago repented sitting in sackcloth and ashes
but it shall be more tolerable for tyre and sidon at the judgment than for you
and thou capernaum which art exalted to heaven shalt be thrust down to hell
he that heareth you heareth me and he that despiseth you despiseth me and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me
and the seventy returned again with joy saying lord even the devils are subject unto us through thy name
and he said unto them i beheld satan as lightning fall from heaven
behold i give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you
notwithstanding in this rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven
in that hour jesus rejoiced in spirit and said i thank thee o father lord of heaven and earth that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight
all things are delivered to me of my father and no man knoweth who the son is but the father and who the father is but the son and he to whom the son will reveal him
and he turned him unto his disciples and said privately blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see
for i tell you that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see and have not seen them and to hear those things which ye hear and have not heard them
and behold a certain lawyer stood up and tempted him saying master what shall i do to inherit eternal life
he said unto him what is written in the law how readest thou
and he answering said thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy strength and with all thy mind and thy neighbour as thyself
and he said unto him thou hast answered right this do and thou shalt live
but he willing to justify himself said unto jesus and who is my neighbour
and jesus answering said a certain man went down from jerusalem to jericho and fell among thieves which stripped him of his raiment and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead
and by chance there came down a certain priest that way and when he saw him he passed by on the other side
and likewise a levite when he was at the place came and looked on him and passed by on the other side
but a certain samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him
and went to him and bound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine and set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him
and on the morrow when he departed he took out two pence and gave them to the host and said unto him take care of him and whatsoever thou spendest more when i come again i will repay thee
which now of these three thinkest thou was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves
and he said he that shewed mercy on him then said jesus unto him go and do thou likewise
now it came to pass as they went that he entered into a certain village and a certain woman named martha received him into her house
and she had a sister called mary which also sat at jesus feet and heard his word
but martha was cumbered about much serving and came to him and said lord dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone bid her therefore that she help me
and jesus answered and said unto her martha martha thou art careful and troubled about many things
but one thing is needful and mary hath chosen that good part which shall not be taken away from her
and it came to pass that as he was praying in a certain place when he ceased one of his disciples said unto him lord teach us to pray as john also taught his disciples
and he said unto them when ye pray say our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done as in heaven so in earth
give us day by day our daily bread
and forgive us our sins for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil
and he said unto them which of you shall have a friend and shall go unto him at midnight and say unto him friend lend me three loaves
for a friend of mine in his journey is come to me and i have nothing to set before him
and he from within shall answer and say trouble me not the door is now shut and my children are with me in bed i cannot rise and give thee
i say unto you though he will not rise and give him because he is his friend yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth
and i say unto you ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you
for every one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened
if a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father will he give him a stone or if he ask a fish will he for a fish give him a serpent
or if he shall ask an egg will he offer him a scorpion
if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your heavenly father give the holy spirit to them that ask him
and he was casting out a devil and it was dumb and it came to pass when the devil was gone out the dumb spake and the people wondered
but some of them said he casteth out devils through beelzebub the chief of the devils
and others tempting him sought of him a sign from heaven
but he knowing their thoughts said unto them every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation and a house divided against a house falleth
if satan also be divided against himself how shall his kingdom stand because ye say that i cast out devils through beelzebub
and if i by beelzebub cast out devils by whom do your sons cast them out therefore shall they be your judges
but if i with the finger of god cast out devils no doubt the kingdom of god is come upon you
when a strong man armed keepeth his palace his goods are in peace
but when a stronger than he shall come upon him and overcome him he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted and divideth his spoils
he that is not with me is against me and he that gathereth not with me scattereth
when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh through dry places seeking rest and finding none he saith i will return unto my house whence i came out
and when he cometh he findeth it swept and garnished
then goeth he and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last state of that man is worse than the first
and it came to pass as he spake these things a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice and said unto him blessed is the womb that bare thee and the paps which thou hast sucked
but he said yea rather blessed are they that hear the word of god and keep it
and when the people were gathered thick together he began to say this is an evil generation they seek a sign and there shall no sign be given it but the sign of jonas the prophet
for as jonas was a sign unto the ninevites so shall also the son of man be to this generation
the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold a greater than solomon is here
the men of nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for they repented at the preaching of jonas and behold a greater than jonas is here
no man when he hath lighted a candle putteth it in a secret place neither under a bushel but on a candlestick that they which come in may see the light
the light of the body is the eye therefore when thine eye is single thy whole body also is full of light but when thine eye is evil thy body also is full of darkness
take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness
if thy whole body therefore be full of light having no part dark the whole shall be full of light as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light
and as he spake a certain pharisee besought him to dine with him and he went in and sat down to meat
and when the pharisee saw it he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner
and the lord said unto him now do ye pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness
ye fools did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also
but rather give alms of such things as ye have and behold all things are clean unto you
but woe unto you pharisees for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs and pass over judgment and the love of god these ought ye to have done and not to leave the other undone
woe unto you pharisees for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues and greetings in the markets
woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye are as graves which appear not and the men that walk over them are not aware of them
then answered one of the lawyers and said unto him master thus saying thou reproachest us also
and he said woe unto you also ye lawyers for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers
woe unto you for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets and your fathers killed them
truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers for they indeed killed them and ye build their sepulchres
therefore also said the wisdom of god i will send them prophets and apostles and some of them they shall slay and persecute
that the blood of all the prophets which was shed from the foundation of the world may be required of this generation
from the blood of abel unto the blood of zacharias which perished between the altar and the temple verily i say unto you it shall be required of this generation
woe unto you lawyers for ye have taken away the key of knowledge ye entered not in yourselves and them that were entering in ye hindered
and as he said these things unto them the scribes and the pharisees began to urge him vehemently and to provoke him to speak of many things
laying wait for him and seeking to catch something out of his mouth that they might accuse him
in the mean time when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people insomuch that they trode one upon another he began to say unto his disciples first of all beware ye of the leaven of the pharisees which is hypocrisy
for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed neither hid that shall not be known
therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops
and i say unto you my friends be not afraid of them that kill the body and after that have no more that they can do
but i will forewarn you whom ye shall fear fear him which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell yea i say unto you fear him
are not five sparrows sold for two farthings and not one of them is forgotten before god
but even the very hairs of your head are all numbered fear not therefore ye are of more value than many sparrows
also i say unto you whosoever shall confess me before men him shall the son of man also confess before the angels of god
but he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of god
and whosoever shall speak a word against the son of man it shall be forgiven him but unto him that blasphemeth against the holy ghost it shall not be forgiven
and when they bring you unto the synagogues and unto magistrates and powers take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer or what ye shall say
for the holy ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say
and one of the company said unto him master speak to my brother that he divide the inheritance with me
and he said unto him man who made me a judge or a divider over you
and he said unto them take heed and beware of covetousness for a mans life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth
and he spake a parable unto them saying the ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully
and he thought within himself saying what shall i do because i have no room where to bestow my fruits
and he said this will i do i will pull down my barns and build greater and there will i bestow all my fruits and my goods
and i will say to my soul soul thou hast much goods laid up for many years take thine ease eat drink and be merry
but god said unto him thou fool this night thy soul shall be required of thee then whose shall those things be which thou hast provided
so is he that layeth up treasure for himself and is not rich toward god
and he said unto his disciples therefore i say unto you take no thought for your life what ye shall eat neither for the body what ye shall put on
the life is more than meat and the body is more than raiment
consider the ravens for they neither sow nor reap which neither have storehouse nor barn and god feedeth them how much more are ye better than the fowls
and which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit
if ye then be not able to do that thing which is least why take ye thought for the rest
consider the lilies how they grow they toil not they spin not and yet i say unto you that solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these
if then god so clothe the grass which is to day in the field and to morrow is cast into the oven how much more will he clothe you o ye of little faith
and seek not ye what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink neither be ye of doubtful mind
for all these things do the nations of the world seek after and your father knoweth that ye have need of these things
but rather seek ye the kingdom of god and all these things shall be added unto you
fear not little flock for it is your fathers good pleasure to give you the kingdom
sell that ye have and give alms provide yourselves bags which wax not old a treasure in the heavens that faileth not where no thief approacheth neither moth corrupteth
for where your treasure is there will your heart be also
let your loins be girded about and your lights burning
and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord when he will return from the wedding that when he cometh and knocketh they may open unto him immediately
blessed are those servants whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching verily i say unto you that he shall gird himself and make them to sit down to meat and will come forth and serve them
and if he shall come in the second watch or come in the third watch and find them so blessed are those servants
and this know that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come he would have watched and not have suffered his house to be broken through
be ye therefore ready also for the son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not
then peter said unto him lord speakest thou this parable unto us or even to all
and the lord said who then is that faithful and wise steward whom his lord shall make ruler over his household to give them their portion of meat in due season
blessed is that servant whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing
of a truth i say unto you that he will make him ruler over all that he hath
but and if that servant say in his heart my lord delayeth his coming and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens and to eat and drink and to be drunken
the lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him and at an hour when he is not aware and will cut him in sunder and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers
and that servant which knew his lords will and prepared not himself neither did according to his will shall be beaten with many stripes
but he that knew not and did commit things worthy of stripes shall be beaten with few stripes for unto whomsoever much is given of him shall be much required and to whom men have committed much of him they will ask the more
i am come to send fire on the earth and what will i if it be already kindled
but i have a baptism to be baptized with and how am i straitened till it be accomplished
suppose ye that i am come to give peace on earth i tell you nay but rather division
for from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided three against two and two against three
the father shall be divided against the son and the son against the father the mother against the daughter and the daughter against the mother the mother in law against her daughter in law and the daughter in law against her mother in law
and he said also to the people when ye see a cloud rise out of the west straightway ye say there cometh a shower and so it is
and when ye see the south wind blow ye say there will be heat and it cometh to pass
ye hypocrites ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth but how is it that ye do not discern this time
yea and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right
when thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate as thou art in the way give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him lest he hale thee to the judge and the judge deliver thee to the officer and the officer cast thee into prison
i tell thee thou shalt not depart thence till thou hast paid the very last mite
there were present at that season some that told him of the galilaeans whose blood pilate had mingled with their sacrifices
and jesus answering said unto them suppose ye that these galilaeans were sinners above all the galilaeans because they suffered such things
i tell you nay but except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish
or those eighteen upon whom the tower in siloam fell and slew them think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in jerusalem
i tell you nay but except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish
he spake also this parable a certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard and he came and sought fruit thereon and found none
then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard behold these three years i come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none cut it down why cumbereth it the ground
and he answering said unto him lord let it alone this year also till i shall dig about it and dung it
and if it bear fruit well and if not then after that thou shalt cut it down
and he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath
and behold there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years and was bowed together and could in no wise lift up herself
and when jesus saw her he called her to him and said unto her woman thou art loosed from thine infirmity
and he laid his hands on her and immediately she was made straight and glorified god
and the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation because that jesus had healed on the sabbath day and said unto the people there are six days in which men ought to work in them therefore come and be healed and not on the sabbath day
the lord then answered him and said thou hypocrite doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall and lead him away to watering
and ought not this woman being a daughter of abraham whom satan hath bound lo these eighteen years be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day
and when he had said these things all his adversaries were ashamed and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him
then said he unto what is the kingdom of god like and whereunto shall i resemble it
it is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and cast into his garden and it grew and waxed a great tree and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it
and again he said whereunto shall i liken the kingdom of god
it is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till the whole was leavened
and he went through the cities and villages teaching and journeying toward jerusalem
then said one unto him lord are there few that be saved and he said unto them
strive to enter in at the strait gate for many i say unto you will seek to enter in and shall not be able
when once the master of the house is risen up and hath shut to the door and ye begin to stand without and to knock at the door saying lord lord open unto us and he shall answer and say unto you i know you not whence ye are
then shall ye begin to say we have eaten and drunk in thy presence and thou hast taught in our streets
but he shall say i tell you i know you not whence ye are depart from me all ye workers of iniquity
there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth when ye shall see abraham and isaac and jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of god and you yourselves thrust out
and they shall come from the east and from the west and from the north and from the south and shall sit down in the kingdom of god
and behold there are last which shall be first and there are first which shall be last
the same day there came certain of the pharisees saying unto him get thee out and depart hence for herod will kill thee
and he said unto them go ye and tell that fox behold i cast out devils and i do cures to day and to morrow and the third day i shall be perfected
nevertheless i must walk to day and to morrow and the day following for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of jerusalem
o jerusalem jerusalem which killest the prophets and stonest them that are sent unto thee how often would i have gathered thy children together as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings and ye would not
behold your house is left unto you desolate and verily i say unto you ye shall not see me until the time come when ye shall say blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord
and it came to pass as he went into the house of one of the chief pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day that they watched him
and behold there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy
and jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and pharisees saying is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day
and they held their peace and he took him and healed him and let him go
and answered them saying which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day
and they could not answer him again to these things
and he put forth a parable to those which were bidden when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms saying unto them
when thou art bidden of any man to a wedding sit not down in the highest room lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him
and he that bade thee and him come and say to thee give this man place and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room
but when thou art bidden go and sit down in the lowest room that when he that bade thee cometh he may say unto thee friend go up higher then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee
for whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted
then said he also to him that bade him when thou makest a dinner or a supper call not thy friends nor thy brethren neither thy kinsmen nor thy rich neighbours lest they also bid thee again and a recompence be made thee
but when thou makest a feast call the poor the maimed the lame the blind
and thou shalt be blessed for they cannot recompense thee for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just
and when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things he said unto him blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of god
then said he unto him a certain man made a great supper and bade many
and sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden come for all things are now ready
and they all with one consent began to make excuse the first said unto him i have bought a piece of ground and i must needs go and see it i pray thee have me excused
and another said i have bought five yoke of oxen and i go to prove them i pray thee have me excused
and another said i have married a wife and therefore i cannot come
so that servant came and shewed his lord these things then the master of the house being angry said to his servant go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in hither the poor and the maimed and the halt and the blind
and the servant said lord it is done as thou hast commanded and yet there is room
and the lord said unto the servant go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled
for i say unto you that none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper
and there went great multitudes with him and he turned and said unto them
if any man come to me and hate not his father and mother and wife and children and brethren and sisters yea and his own life also he cannot be my disciple
and whosoever doth not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple
for which of you intending to build a tower sitteth not down first and counteth the cost whether he have sufficient to finish it
lest haply after he hath laid the foundation and is not able to finish it all that behold it begin to mock him
saying this man began to build and was not able to finish
or what king going to make war against another king sitteth not down first and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand
or else while the other is yet a great way off he sendeth an ambassage and desireth conditions of peace
so likewise whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath he cannot be my disciple
salt is good but if the salt have lost his savour wherewith shall it be seasoned
it is neither fit for the land nor yet for the dunghill but men cast it out he that hath ears to hear let him hear
then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him
and the pharisees and scribes murmured saying this man receiveth sinners and eateth with them
and he spake this parable unto them saying
what man of you having an hundred sheep if he lose one of them doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness and go after that which is lost until he find it
and when he hath found it he layeth it on his shoulders rejoicing
and when he cometh home he calleth together his friends and neighbours saying unto them rejoice with me for i have found my sheep which was lost
i say unto you that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth more than over ninety and nine just persons which need no repentance
either what woman having ten pieces of silver if she lose one piece doth not light a candle and sweep the house and seek diligently till she find it
and when she hath found it she calleth her friends and her neighbours together saying rejoice with me for i have found the piece which i had lost
likewise i say unto you there is joy in the presence of the angels of god over one sinner that repenteth
and he said a certain man had two sons
and the younger of them said to his father father give me the portion of goods that falleth to me and he divided unto them his living
and not many days after the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country and there wasted his substance with riotous living
and when he had spent all there arose a mighty famine in that land and he began to be in want
and he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country and he sent him into his fields to feed swine
and he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat and no man gave unto him
and when he came to himself he said how many hired servants of my fathers have bread enough and to spare and i perish with hunger
i will arise and go to my father and will say unto him father i have sinned against heaven and before thee
and am no more worthy to be called thy son make me as one of thy hired servants
and he arose and came to his father but when he was yet a great way off his father saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him
and the son said unto him father i have sinned against heaven and in thy sight and am no more worthy to be called thy son
but the father said to his servants bring forth the best robe and put it on him and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet
and bring hither the fatted calf and kill it and let us eat and be merry
for this my son was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found and they began to be merry
now his elder son was in the field and as he came and drew nigh to the house he heard musick and dancing
and he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant
and he said unto him thy brother is come and thy father hath killed the fatted calf because he hath received him safe and sound
and he was angry and would not go in therefore came his father out and intreated him
and he answering said to his father lo these many years do i serve thee neither transgressed i at any time thy commandment and yet thou never gavest me a kid that i might make merry with my friends
but as soon as this thy son was come which hath devoured thy living with harlots thou hast killed for him the fatted calf
and he said unto him son thou art ever with me and all that i have is thine
it was meet that we should make merry and be glad for this thy brother was dead and is alive again and was lost and is found
and he said also unto his disciples there was a certain rich man which had a steward and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods
and he called him and said unto him how is it that i hear this of thee give an account of thy stewardship for thou mayest be no longer steward
then the steward said within himself what shall i do for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship i cannot dig to beg i am ashamed
i am resolved what to do that when i am put out of the stewardship they may receive me into their houses
so he called every one of his lords debtors unto him and said unto the first how much owest thou unto my lord
and he said an hundred measures of oil and he said unto him take thy bill and sit down quickly and write fifty
then said he to another and how much owest thou and he said an hundred measures of wheat and he said unto him take thy bill and write fourscore
and the lord commended the unjust steward because he had done wisely for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light
and i say unto you make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness that when ye fail they may receive you into everlasting habitations
he that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much
if therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon who will commit to your trust the true riches
and if ye have not been faithful in that which is another mans who shall give you that which is your own
no servant can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other ye cannot serve god and mammon
and the pharisees also who were covetous heard all these things and they derided him
and he said unto them ye are they which justify yourselves before men but god knoweth your hearts for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of god
the law and the prophets were until john since that time the kingdom of god is preached and every man presseth into it
and it is easier for heaven and earth to pass than one tittle of the law to fail
whosoever putteth away his wife and marrieth another committeth adultery and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery
there was a certain rich man which was clothed in purple and fine linen and fared sumptuously every day
and there was a certain beggar named lazarus which was laid at his gate full of sores
and desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich mans table moreover the dogs came and licked his sores
and it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the angels into abrahams bosom the rich man also died and was buried
and in hell he lift up his eyes being in torments and seeth abraham afar off and lazarus in his bosom
and he cried and said father abraham have mercy on me and send lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue for i am tormented in this flame
but abraham said son remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things and likewise lazarus evil things but now he is comforted and thou art tormented
and beside all this between us and you there is a great gulf fixed so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot neither can they pass to us that would come from thence
then he said i pray thee therefore father that thou wouldest send him to my fathers house
for i have five brethren that he may testify unto them lest they also come into this place of torment
abraham saith unto him they have moses and the prophets let them hear them
and he said nay father abraham but if one went unto them from the dead they will repent
and he said unto him if they hear not moses and the prophets neither will they be persuaded though one rose from the dead
then said he unto the disciples it is impossible but that offences will come but woe unto him through whom they come
it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he cast into the sea than that he should offend one of these little ones
take heed to yourselves if thy brother trespass against thee rebuke him and if he repent forgive him
and if he trespass against thee seven times in a day and seven times in a day turn again to thee saying i repent thou shalt forgive him
and the apostles said unto the lord increase our faith
and the lord said if ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed ye might say unto this sycamine tree be thou plucked up by the root and be thou planted in the sea and it should obey you
but which of you having a servant plowing or feeding cattle will say unto him by and by when he is come from the field go and sit down to meat
and will not rather say unto him make ready wherewith i may sup and gird thyself and serve me till i have eaten and drunken and afterward thou shalt eat and drink
doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him i trow not
so likewise ye when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you say we are unprofitable servants we have done that which was our duty to do
and it came to pass as he went to jerusalem that he passed through the midst of samaria and galilee
and as he entered into a certain village there met him ten men that were lepers which stood afar off
and they lifted up their voices and said jesus master have mercy on us
and when he saw them he said unto them go shew yourselves unto the priests and it came to pass that as they went they were cleansed
and one of them when he saw that he was healed turned back and with a loud voice glorified god
and fell down on his face at his feet giving him thanks and he was a samaritan
and jesus answering said were there not ten cleansed but where are the nine
there are not found that returned to give glory to god save this stranger
and he said unto him arise go thy way thy faith hath made thee whole
and when he was demanded of the pharisees when the kingdom of god should come he answered them and said the kingdom of god cometh not with observation
neither shall they say lo here or lo there for behold the kingdom of god is within you
and he said unto the disciples the days will come when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the son of man and ye shall not see it
and they shall say to you see here or see there go not after them nor follow them
for as the lightning that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven shineth unto the other part under heaven so shall also the son of man be in his day
but first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generation
and as it was in the days of noe so shall it be also in the days of the son of man
they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that noe entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all
likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded
but the same day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all
even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed
in that day he which shall be upon the housetop and his stuff in the house let him not come down to take it away and he that is in the field let him likewise not return back
remember lots wife
whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it
i tell you in that night there shall be two men in one bed the one shall be taken and the other shall be left
two women shall be grinding together the one shall be taken and the other left
two men shall be in the field the one shall be taken and the other left
and they answered and said unto him where lord and he said unto them wheresoever the body is thither will the eagles be gathered together
and he spake a parable unto them to this end that men ought always to pray and not to faint
saying there was in a city a judge which feared not god neither regarded man
and there was a widow in that city and she came unto him saying avenge me of mine adversary
and he would not for a while but afterward he said within himself though i fear not god nor regard man
yet because this widow troubleth me i will avenge her lest by her continual coming she weary me
and the lord said hear what the unjust judge saith
and shall not god avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him though he bear long with them
i tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth
and he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others
two men went up into the temple to pray the one a pharisee and the other a publican
the pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself god i thank thee that i am not as other men are extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this publican
i fast twice in the week i give tithes of all that i possess
and the publican standing afar off would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but smote upon his breast saying god be merciful to me a sinner
i tell you this man went down to his house justified rather than the other for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted
and they brought unto him also infants that he would touch them but when his disciples saw it they rebuked them
but jesus called them unto him and said suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of god
verily i say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god as a little child shall in no wise enter therein
and a certain ruler asked him saying good master what shall i do to inherit eternal life
and jesus said unto him why callest thou me good none is good save one that is god
thou knowest the commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness honour thy father and thy mother
and he said all these have i kept from my youth up
now when jesus heard these things he said unto him yet lackest thou one thing sell all that thou hast and distribute unto the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come follow me
and when he heard this he was very sorrowful for he was very rich
and when jesus saw that he was very sorrowful he said how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god
for it is easier for a camel to go through a needles eye than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god
and they that heard it said who then can be saved
and he said the things which are impossible with men are possible with god
then peter said lo we have left all and followed thee
and he said unto them verily i say unto you there is no man that hath left house or parents or brethren or wife or children for the kingdom of gods sake
who shall not receive manifold more in this present time and in the world to come life everlasting
then he took unto him the twelve and said unto them behold we go up to jerusalem and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the son of man shall be accomplished
for he shall be delivered unto the gentiles and shall be mocked and spitefully entreated and spitted on
and they shall scourge him and put him to death and the third day he shall rise again
and they understood none of these things and this saying was hid from them neither knew they the things which were spoken
and it came to pass that as he was come nigh unto jericho a certain blind man sat by the way side begging
and hearing the multitude pass by he asked what it meant
and they told him that jesus of nazareth passeth by
and he cried saying jesus thou son of david have mercy on me
and they which went before rebuked him that he should hold his peace but he cried so much the more thou son of david have mercy on me
and jesus stood and commanded him to be brought unto him and when he was come near he asked him
saying what wilt thou that i shall do unto thee and he said lord that i may receive my sight
and jesus said unto him receive thy sight thy faith hath saved thee
and immediately he received his sight and followed him glorifying god and all the people when they saw it gave praise unto god
and jesus entered and passed through jericho
and behold there was a man named zacchaeus which was the chief among the publicans and he was rich
and he sought to see jesus who he was and could not for the press because he was little of stature
and he ran before and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him for he was to pass that way
and when jesus came to the place he looked up and saw him and said unto him zacchaeus make haste and come down for to day i must abide at thy house
and he made haste and came down and received him joyfully
and when they saw it they all murmured saying that he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner
and zacchaeus stood and said unto the lord behold lord the half of my goods i give to the poor and if i have taken any thing from any man by false accusation i restore him fourfold
and jesus said unto him this day is salvation come to this house forsomuch as he also is a son of abraham
for the son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost
and as they heard these things he added and spake a parable because he was nigh to jerusalem and because they thought that the kingdom of god should immediately appear
he said therefore a certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return
and he called his ten servants and delivered them ten pounds and said unto them occupy till i come
but his citizens hated him and sent a message after him saying we will not have this man to reign over us
and it came to pass that when he was returned having received the kingdom then he commanded these servants to be called unto him to whom he had given the money that he might know how much every man had gained by trading
then came the first saying lord thy pound hath gained ten pounds
and he said unto him well thou good servant because thou hast been faithful in a very little have thou authority over ten cities
and the second came saying lord thy pound hath gained five pounds
and he said likewise to him be thou also over five cities
and another came saying lord behold here is thy pound which i have kept laid up in a napkin
for i feared thee because thou art an austere man thou takest up that thou layedst not down and reapest that thou didst not sow
and he saith unto him out of thine own mouth will i judge thee thou wicked servant thou knewest that i was an austere man taking up that i laid not down and reaping that i did not sow
wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank that at my coming i might have required mine own with usury
and he said unto them that stood by take from him the pound and give it to him that hath ten pounds
and they said unto him lord he hath ten pounds
for i say unto you that unto every one which hath shall be given and from him that hath not even that he hath shall be taken away from him
but those mine enemies which would not that i should reign over them bring hither and slay them before me
and when he had thus spoken he went before ascending up to jerusalem
and it came to pass when he was come nigh to bethphage and bethany at the mount called the mount of olives he sent two of his disciples
saying go ye into the village over against you in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied whereon yet never man sat loose him and bring him hither
and if any man ask you why do ye loose him thus shall ye say unto him because the lord hath need of him
and they that were sent went their way and found even as he had said unto them
and as they were loosing the colt the owners thereof said unto them why loose ye the colt
and they said the lord hath need of him
and they brought him to jesus and they cast their garments upon the colt and they set jesus thereon
and as he went they spread their clothes in the way
and when he was come nigh even now at the descent of the mount of olives the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise god with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen
saying blessed be the king that cometh in the name of the lord peace in heaven and glory in the highest
and some of the pharisees from among the multitude said unto him master rebuke thy disciples
and he answered and said unto them i tell you that if these should hold their peace the stones would immediately cry out
and when he was come near he beheld the city and wept over it
saying if thou hadst known even thou at least in this thy day the things which belong unto thy peace but now they are hid from thine eyes
for the days shall come upon thee that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee and compass thee round and keep thee in on every side
and shall lay thee even with the ground and thy children within thee and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation
and he went into the temple and began to cast out them that sold therein and them that bought
saying unto them it is written my house is the house of prayer but ye have made it a den of thieves
and he taught daily in the temple but the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him
and could not find what they might do for all the people were very attentive to hear him
and it came to pass that on one of those days as he taught the people in the temple and preached the gospel the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders
and spake unto him saying tell us by what authority doest thou these things or who is he that gave thee this authority
and he answered and said unto them i will also ask you one thing and answer me
the baptism of john was it from heaven or of men
and they reasoned with themselves saying if we shall say from heaven he will say why then believed ye him not
but and if we say of men all the people will stone us for they be persuaded that john was a prophet
and they answered that they could not tell whence it was
and jesus said unto them neither tell i you by what authority i do these things
then began he to speak to the people this parable a certain man planted a vineyard and let it forth to husbandmen and went into a far country for a long time
and at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard but the husbandmen beat him and sent him away empty
and again he sent another servant and they beat him also and entreated him shamefully and sent him away empty
and again he sent a third and they wounded him also and cast him out
then said the lord of the vineyard what shall i do i will send my beloved son it may be they will reverence him when they see him
but when the husbandmen saw him they reasoned among themselves saying this is the heir come let us kill him that the inheritance may be ours
so they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him what therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them
he shall come and destroy these husbandmen and shall give the vineyard to others and when they heard it they said god forbid
and he beheld them and said what is this then that is written the stone which the builders rejected the same is become the head of the corner
whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken but on whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder
and the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him and they feared the people for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them
and they watched him and sent forth spies which should feign themselves just men that they might take hold of his words that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor
and they asked him saying master we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly neither acceptest thou the person of any but teachest the way of god truly
is it lawful for us to give tribute unto caesar or no
but he perceived their craftiness and said unto them why tempt ye me
shew me a penny whose image and superscription hath it they answered and said caesars
and he said unto them render therefore unto caesar the things which be caesars and unto god the things which be gods
and they could not take hold of his words before the people and they marvelled at his answer and held their peace
then came to him certain of the sadducees which deny that there is any resurrection and they asked him
saying master moses wrote unto us if any mans brother die having a wife and he die without children that his brother should take his wife and raise up seed unto his brother
there were therefore seven brethren and the first took a wife and died without children
and the second took her to wife and he died childless
and the third took her and in like manner the seven also and they left no children and died
last of all the woman died also
therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she for seven had her to wife
and jesus answering said unto them the children of this world marry and are given in marriage
but they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage
neither can they die any more for they are equal unto the angels and are the children of god being the children of the resurrection
now that the dead are raised even moses shewed at the bush when he calleth the lord the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob
for he is not a god of the dead but of the living for all live unto him
then certain of the scribes answering said master thou hast well said
and after that they durst not ask him any question at all
and he said unto them how say they that christ is davids son
and david himself saith in the book of psalms the lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand
till i make thine enemies thy footstool
david therefore calleth him lord how is he then his son
then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples
beware of the scribes which desire to walk in long robes and love greetings in the markets and the highest seats in the synagogues and the chief rooms at feasts
which devour widows houses and for a shew make long prayers the same shall receive greater damnation
and he looked up and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury
and he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites
and he said of a truth i say unto you that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all
for all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of god but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had
and as some spake of the temple how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts he said
as for these things which ye behold the days will come in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down
and they asked him saying master but when shall these things be and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass
and he said take heed that ye be not deceived for many shall come in my name saying i am christ and the time draweth near go ye not therefore after them
but when ye shall hear of wars and commotions be not terrified for these things must first come to pass but the end is not by and by
then said he unto them nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom
and great earthquakes shall be in divers places and famines and pestilences and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven
but before all these they shall lay their hands on you and persecute you delivering you up to the synagogues and into prisons being brought before kings and rulers for my names sake
and it shall turn to you for a testimony
settle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate before what ye shall answer
for i will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist
and ye shall be betrayed both by parents and brethren and kinsfolks and friends and some of you shall they cause to be put to death
and ye shall be hated of all men for my names sake
but there shall not an hair of your head perish
in your patience possess ye your souls
and when ye shall see jerusalem compassed with armies then know that the desolation thereof is nigh
then let them which are in judaea flee to the mountains and let them which are in the midst of it depart out and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto
for these be the days of vengeance that all things which are written may be fulfilled
but woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days for there shall be great distress in the land and wrath upon this people
and they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led away captive into all nations and jerusalem shall be trodden down of the gentiles until the times of the gentiles be fulfilled
and there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity the sea and the waves roaring
mens hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of heaven shall be shaken
and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory
and when these things begin to come to pass then look up and lift up your heads for your redemption draweth nigh
and he spake to them a parable behold the fig tree and all the trees
when they now shoot forth ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand
so likewise ye when ye see these things come to pass know ye that the kingdom of god is nigh at hand
verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass away till all be fulfilled
heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away
and take heed to yourselves lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness and cares of this life and so that day come upon you unawares
for as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth
watch ye therefore and pray always that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and to stand before the son of man
and in the day time he was teaching in the temple and at night he went out and abode in the mount that is called the mount of olives
and all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple for to hear him
now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh which is called the passover
and the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him for they feared the people
then entered satan into judas surnamed iscariot being of the number of the twelve
and he went his way and communed with the chief priests and captains how he might betray him unto them
and they were glad and covenanted to give him money
and he promised and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude
then came the day of unleavened bread when the passover must be killed
and he sent peter and john saying go and prepare us the passover that we may eat
and they said unto him where wilt thou that we prepare
and he said unto them behold when ye are entered into the city there shall a man meet you bearing a pitcher of water follow him into the house where he entereth in
and ye shall say unto the goodman of the house the master saith unto thee where is the guestchamber where i shall eat the passover with my disciples
and he shall shew you a large upper room furnished there make ready
and they went and found as he had said unto them and they made ready the passover
and when the hour was come he sat down and the twelve apostles with him
and he said unto them with desire i have desired to eat this passover with you before i suffer
for i say unto you i will not any more eat thereof until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of god
and he took the cup and gave thanks and said take this and divide it among yourselves
for i say unto you i will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of god shall come
and he took bread and gave thanks and brake it and gave unto them saying this is my body which is given for you this do in remembrance of me
likewise also the cup after supper saying this cup is the new testament in my blood which is shed for you
but behold the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table
and truly the son of man goeth as it was determined but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed
and they began to enquire among themselves which of them it was that should do this thing
and there was also a strife among them which of them should be accounted the greatest
and he said unto them the kings of the gentiles exercise lordship over them and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors
but ye shall not be so but he that is greatest among you let him be as the younger and he that is chief as he that doth serve
for whether is greater he that sitteth at meat or he that serveth is not he that sitteth at meat but i am among you as he that serveth
ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations
and i appoint unto you a kingdom as my father hath appointed unto me
that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel
and the lord said simon simon behold satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat
but i have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy brethren
and he said unto him lord i am ready to go with thee both into prison and to death
and he said i tell thee peter the cock shall not crow this day before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me
and he said unto them when i sent you without purse and scrip and shoes lacked ye any thing and they said nothing
then said he unto them but now he that hath a purse let him take it and likewise his scrip and he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
for i say unto you that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me and he was reckoned among the transgressors for the things concerning me have an end
and they said lord behold here are two swords and he said unto them it is enough
and he came out and went as he was wont to the mount of olives and his disciples also followed him
and when he was at the place he said unto them pray that ye enter not into temptation
and he was withdrawn from them about a stones cast and kneeled down and prayed
saying father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done
and there appeared an angel unto him from heaven strengthening him
and being in an agony he prayed more earnestly and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground
and when he rose up from prayer and was come to his disciples he found them sleeping for sorrow
and said unto them why sleep ye rise and pray lest ye enter into temptation
and while he yet spake behold a multitude and he that was called judas one of the twelve went before them and drew near unto jesus to kiss him
but jesus said unto him judas betrayest thou the son of man with a kiss
when they which were about him saw what would follow they said unto him lord shall we smite with the sword
and one of them smote the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear
and jesus answered and said suffer ye thus far and he touched his ear and healed him
then jesus said unto the chief priests and captains of the temple and the elders which were come to him be ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves
when i was daily with you in the temple ye stretched forth no hands against me but this is your hour and the power of darkness
then took they him and led him and brought him into the high priests house and peter followed afar off
and when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall and were set down together peter sat down among them
but a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire and earnestly looked upon him and said this man was also with him
and he denied him saying woman i know him not
and after a little while another saw him and said thou art also of them and peter said man i am not
and about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed saying of a truth this fellow also was with him for he is a galilaean
and peter said man i know not what thou sayest and immediately while he yet spake the cock crew
and the lord turned and looked upon peter and peter remembered the word of the lord how he had said unto him before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice
and peter went out and wept bitterly
and the men that held jesus mocked him and smote him
and when they had blindfolded him they struck him on the face and asked him saying prophesy who is it that smote thee
and many other things blasphemously spake they against him
and as soon as it was day the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together and led him into their council saying
art thou the christ tell us and he said unto them if i tell you ye will not believe
and if i also ask you ye will not answer me nor let me go
hereafter shall the son of man sit on the right hand of the power of god
then said they all art thou then the son of god and he said unto them ye say that i am
and they said what need we any further witness for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth
and the whole multitude of them arose and led him unto pilate
and they began to accuse him saying we found this fellow perverting the nation and forbidding to give tribute to caesar saying that he himself is christ a king
and pilate asked him saying art thou the king of the jews and he answered him and said thou sayest it
then said pilate to the chief priests and to the people i find no fault in this man
and they were the more fierce saying he stirreth up the people teaching throughout all jewry beginning from galilee to this place
when pilate heard of galilee he asked whether the man were a galilaean
and as soon as he knew that he belonged unto herods jurisdiction he sent him to herod who himself also was at jerusalem at that time
and when herod saw jesus he was exceeding glad for he was desirous to see him of a long season because he had heard many things of him and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him
then he questioned with him in many words but he answered him nothing
and the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him
and herod with his men of war set him at nought and mocked him and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe and sent him again to pilate
and the same day pilate and herod were made friends together for before they were at enmity between themselves
and pilate when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people
said unto them ye have brought this man unto me as one that perverteth the people and behold i having examined him before you have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him
no nor yet herod for i sent you to him and lo nothing worthy of death is done unto him
i will therefore chastise him and release him
for of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast
and they cried out all at once saying away with this man and release unto us barabbas
who for a certain sedition made in the city and for murder was cast into prison
pilate therefore willing to release jesus spake again to them
but they cried saying crucify him crucify him
and he said unto them the third time why what evil hath he done i have found no cause of death in him i will therefore chastise him and let him go
and they were instant with loud voices requiring that he might be crucified and the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed
and pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required
and he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison whom they had desired but he delivered jesus to their will
and as they led him away they laid hold upon one simon a cyrenian coming out of the country and on him they laid the cross that he might bear it after jesus
and there followed him a great company of people and of women which also bewailed and lamented him
but jesus turning unto them said daughters of jerusalem weep not for me but weep for yourselves and for your children
for behold the days are coming in the which they shall say blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bare and the paps which never gave suck
then shall they begin to say to the mountains fall on us and to the hills cover us
for if they do these things in a green tree what shall be done in the dry
and there were also two other malefactors led with him to be put to death
and when they were come to the place which is called calvary there they crucified him and the malefactors one on the right hand and the other on the left
then said jesus father forgive them for they know not what they do and they parted his raiment and cast lots
and the people stood beholding and the rulers also with them derided him saying he saved others let him save himself if he be christ the chosen of god
and the soldiers also mocked him coming to him and offering him vinegar
and saying if thou be the king of the jews save thyself
and a superscription also was written over him in letters of greek and latin and hebrew this is the king of the jews
and one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him saying if thou be christ save thyself and us
but the other answering rebuked him saying dost not thou fear god seeing thou art in the same condemnation
and we indeed justly for we receive the due reward of our deeds but this man hath done nothing amiss
and he said unto jesus lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom
and jesus said unto him verily i say unto thee to day shalt thou be with me in paradise
and it was about the sixth hour and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour
and the sun was darkened and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst
and when jesus had cried with a loud voice he said father into thy hands i commend my spirit and having said thus he gave up the ghost
now when the centurion saw what was done he glorified god saying certainly this was a righteous man
and all the people that came together to that sight beholding the things which were done smote their breasts and returned
and all his acquaintance and the women that followed him from galilee stood afar off beholding these things
and behold there was a man named joseph a counsellor and he was a good man and a just
the same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them he was of arimathaea a city of the jews who also himself waited for the kingdom of god
this man went unto pilate and begged the body of jesus
and he took it down and wrapped it in linen and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone wherein never man before was laid
and that day was the preparation and the sabbath drew on
and the women also which came with him from galilee followed after and beheld the sepulchre and how his body was laid
and they returned and prepared spices and ointments and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment
now upon the first day of the week very early in the morning they came unto the sepulchre bringing the spices which they had prepared and certain others with them
and they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre
and they entered in and found not the body of the lord jesus
and it came to pass as they were much perplexed thereabout behold two men stood by them in shining garments
and as they were afraid and bowed down their faces to the earth they said unto them why seek ye the living among the dead
he is not here but is risen remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in galilee
saying the son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and the third day rise again
and they remembered his words
and returned from the sepulchre and told all these things unto the eleven and to all the rest
it was mary magdalene and joanna and mary the mother of james and other women that were with them which told these things unto the apostles
and their words seemed to them as idle tales and they believed them not
then arose peter and ran unto the sepulchre and stooping down he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves and departed wondering in himself at that which was come to pass
and behold two of them went that same day to a village called emmaus which was from jerusalem about threescore furlongs
and they talked together of all these things which had happened
and it came to pass that while they communed together and reasoned jesus himself drew near and went with them
but their eyes were holden that they should not know him
and he said unto them what manner of communications are these that ye have one to another as ye walk and are sad
and the one of them whose name was cleopas answering said unto him art thou only a stranger in jerusalem and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days
and he said unto them what things and they said unto him concerning jesus of nazareth which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before god and all the people
and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him
but we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed israel and beside all this to day is the third day since these things were done
yea and certain women also of our company made us astonished which were early at the sepulchre
and when they found not his body they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive
and certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre and found it even so as the women had said but him they saw not
then he said unto them o fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken
ought not christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory
and beginning at moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself
and they drew nigh unto the village whither they went and he made as though he would have gone further
but they constrained him saying abide with us for it is toward evening and the day is far spent and he went in to tarry with them
and it came to pass as he sat at meat with them he took bread and blessed it and brake and gave to them
and their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight
and they said one to another did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scriptures
and they rose up the same hour and returned to jerusalem and found the eleven gathered together and them that were with them
saying the lord is risen indeed and hath appeared to simon
and they told what things were done in the way and how he was known of them in breaking of bread
and as they thus spake jesus himself stood in the midst of them and saith unto them peace be unto you
but they were terrified and affrighted and supposed that they had seen a spirit
and he said unto them why are ye troubled and why do thoughts arise in your hearts
behold my hands and my feet that it is i myself handle me and see for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see me have
and when he had thus spoken he shewed them his hands and his feet
and while they yet believed not for joy and wondered he said unto them have ye here any meat
and they gave him a piece of a broiled fish and of an honeycomb
and he took it and did eat before them
and he said unto them these are the words which i spake unto you while i was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of moses and in the prophets and in the psalms concerning me
then opened he their understanding that they might understand the scriptures
and said unto them thus it is written and thus it behoved christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day
and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at jerusalem
and ye are witnesses of these things
and behold i send the promise of my father upon you but tarry ye in the city of jerusalem until ye be endued with power from on high
and he led them out as far as to bethany and he lifted up his hands and blessed them
and it came to pass while he blessed them he was parted from them and carried up into heaven
and they worshipped him and returned to jerusalem with great joy
and were continually in the temple praising and blessing god amen
paul a servant of jesus christ called to be an apostle separated unto the gospel of god
which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures
concerning his son jesus christ our lord which was made of the seed of david according to the flesh
and declared to be the son of god with power according to the spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the dead
by whom we have received grace and apostleship for obedience to the faith among all nations for his name
among whom are ye also the called of jesus christ
to all that be in rome beloved of god called to be saints grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
first i thank my god through jesus christ for you all that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world
for god is my witness whom i serve with my spirit in the gospel of his son that without ceasing i make mention of you always in my prayers
making request if by any means now at length i might have a prosperous journey by the will of god to come unto you
for i long to see you that i may impart unto you some spiritual gift to the end ye may be established
that is that i may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me
now i would not have you ignorant brethren that oftentimes i purposed to come unto you but was let hitherto that i might have some fruit among you also even as among other gentiles
i am debtor both to the greeks and to the barbarians both to the wise and to the unwise
so as much as in me is i am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at rome also
for i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ for it is the power of god unto salvation to every one that believeth to the jew first and also to the greek
for therein is the righteousness of god revealed from faith to faith as it is written the just shall live by faith
for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness
because that which may be known of god is manifest in them for god hath shewed it unto them
for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse
because that when they knew god they glorified him not as god neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened
professing themselves to be wise they became fools
and changed the glory of the uncorruptible god into an image made like to corruptible man and to birds and fourfooted beasts and creeping things
wherefore god also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts to dishonour their own bodies between themselves
who changed the truth of god into a lie and worshipped and served the creature more than the creator who is blessed for ever amen
for this cause god gave them up unto vile affections for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature
and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust one toward another men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet
and even as they did not like to retain god in their knowledge god gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient
being filled with all unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetousness maliciousness full of envy murder debate deceit malignity whisperers
backbiters haters of god despiteful proud boasters inventors of evil things disobedient to parents
without understanding covenantbreakers without natural affection implacable unmerciful
who knowing the judgment of god that they which commit such things are worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them
therefore thou art inexcusable o man whosoever thou art that judgest for wherein thou judgest another thou condemnest thyself for thou that judgest doest the same things
but we are sure that the judgment of god is according to truth against them which commit such things
and thinkest thou this o man that judgest them which do such things and doest the same that thou shalt escape the judgment of god
or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering not knowing that the goodness of god leadeth thee to repentance
but after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of god
who will render to every man according to his deeds
to them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality eternal life
but unto them that are contentious and do not obey the truth but obey unrighteousness indignation and wrath
tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that doeth evil of the jew first and also of the gentile
but glory honour and peace to every man that worketh good to the jew first and also to the gentile
for there is no respect of persons with god
for as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law
for not the hearers of the law are just before god but the doers of the law shall be justified
for when the gentiles which have not the law do by nature the things contained in the law these having not the law are a law unto themselves
which shew the work of the law written in their hearts their conscience also bearing witness and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another
in the day when god shall judge the secrets of men by jesus christ according to my gospel
behold thou art called a jew and restest in the law and makest thy boast of god
and knowest his will and approvest the things that are more excellent being instructed out of the law
and art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind a light of them which are in darkness
the beginning of the gospel of jesus christ the son of god
as it is written in the prophets behold i send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee
the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make his paths straight
john did baptize in the wilderness and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins
and there went out unto him all the land of judaea and they of jerusalem and were all baptized of him in the river of jordan confessing their sins
and john was clothed with camels hair and with a girdle of a skin about his loins and he did eat locusts and wild honey
and preached saying there cometh one mightier than i after me the latchet of whose shoes i am not worthy to stoop down and unloose
i indeed have baptized you with water but he shall baptize you with the holy ghost
and it came to pass in those days that jesus came from nazareth of galilee and was baptized of john in jordan
and straightway coming up out of the water he saw the heavens opened and the spirit like a dove descending upon him
and there came a voice from heaven saying thou art my beloved son in whom i am well pleased
and immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness
and he was there in the wilderness forty days tempted of satan and was with the wild beasts and the angels ministered unto him
now after that john was put in prison jesus came into galilee preaching the gospel of the kingdom of god
and saying the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of god is at hand repent ye and believe the gospel
now as he walked by the sea of galilee he saw simon and andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for they were fishers
and jesus said unto them come ye after me and i will make you to become fishers of men
and straightway they forsook their nets and followed him
and when he had gone a little farther thence he saw james the son of zebedee and john his brother who also were in the ship mending their nets
and straightway he called them and they left their father zebedee in the ship with the hired servants and went after him
and they went into capernaum and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught
and they were astonished at his doctrine for he taught them as one that had authority and not as the scribes
and there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit and he cried out
saying let us alone what have we to do with thee thou jesus of nazareth art thou come to destroy us i know thee who thou art the holy one of god
and jesus rebuked him saying hold thy peace and come out of him
and when the unclean spirit had torn him and cried with a loud voice he came out of him
and they were all amazed insomuch that they questioned among themselves saying what thing is this what new doctrine is this for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits and they do obey him
and immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about galilee
and forthwith when they were come out of the synagogue they entered into the house of simon and andrew with james and john
but simons wifes mother lay sick of a fever and anon they tell him of her
and he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up and immediately the fever left her and she ministered unto them
and at even when the sun did set they brought unto him all that were diseased and them that were possessed with devils
and all the city was gathered together at the door
and he healed many that were sick of divers diseases and cast out many devils and suffered not the devils to speak because they knew him
and in the morning rising up a great while before day he went out and departed into a solitary place and there prayed
and simon and they that were with him followed after him
and when they had found him they said unto him all men seek for thee
and he said unto them let us go into the next towns that i may preach there also for therefore came i forth
and he preached in their synagogues throughout all galilee and cast out devils
and there came a leper to him beseeching him and kneeling down to him and saying unto him if thou wilt thou canst make me clean
and jesus moved with compassion put forth his hand and touched him and saith unto him i will be thou clean
and as soon as he had spoken immediately the leprosy departed from him and he was cleansed
and he straitly charged him and forthwith sent him away
and saith unto him see thou say nothing to any man but go thy way shew thyself to the priest and offer for thy cleansing those things which moses commanded for a testimony unto them
but he went out and began to publish it much and to blaze abroad the matter insomuch that jesus could no more openly enter into the city but was without in desert places and they came to him from every quarter
and again he entered into capernaum after some days and it was noised that he was in the house
and straightway many were gathered together insomuch that there was no room to receive them no not so much as about the door and he preached the word unto them
and they come unto him bringing one sick of the palsy which was borne of four
and when they could not come nigh unto him for the press they uncovered the roof where he was and when they had broken it up they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay
when jesus saw their faith he said unto the sick of the palsy son thy sins be forgiven thee
but there was certain of the scribes sitting there and reasoning in their hearts
why doth this man thus speak blasphemies who can forgive sins but god only
and immediately when jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves he said unto them why reason ye these things in your hearts
whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy thy sins be forgiven thee or to say arise and take up thy bed and walk
but that ye may know that the son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins he saith to the sick of the palsy
i say unto thee arise and take up thy bed and go thy way into thine house
and immediately he arose took up the bed and went forth before them all insomuch that they were all amazed and glorified god saying we never saw it on this fashion
and he went forth again by the sea side and all the multitude resorted unto him and he taught them
and as he passed by he saw levi the son of alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom and said unto him follow me and he arose and followed him
and it came to pass that as jesus sat at meat in his house many publicans and sinners sat also together with jesus and his disciples for there were many and they followed him
and when the scribes and pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners they said unto his disciples how is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners
when jesus heard it he saith unto them they that are whole have no need of the physician but they that are sick i came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance
and the disciples of john and of the pharisees used to fast and they come and say unto him why do the disciples of john and of the pharisees fast but thy disciples fast not
and jesus said unto them can the children of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them as long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast
but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them and then shall they fast in those days
no man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old and the rent is made worse
and no man putteth new wine into old bottles else the new wine doth burst the bottles and the wine is spilled and the bottles will be marred but new wine must be put into new bottles
and it came to pass that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day and his disciples began as they went to pluck the ears of corn
and the pharisees said unto him behold why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful
and he said unto them have ye never read what david did when he had need and was an hungred he and they that were with him
how he went into the house of god in the days of abiathar the high priest and did eat the shewbread which is not lawful to eat but for the priests and gave also to them which were with him
and he said unto them the sabbath was made for man and not man for the sabbath
therefore the son of man is lord also of the sabbath
and he entered again into the synagogue and there was a man there which had a withered hand
and they watched him whether he would heal him on the sabbath day that they might accuse him
and he saith unto the man which had the withered hand stand forth
and he saith unto them is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days or to do evil to save life or to kill but they held their peace
and when he had looked round about on them with anger being grieved for the hardness of their hearts he saith unto the man stretch forth thine hand and he stretched it out and his hand was restored whole as the other
and the pharisees went forth and straightway took counsel with the herodians against him how they might destroy him
but jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea and a great multitude from galilee followed him and from judaea
and from jerusalem and from idumaea and from beyond jordan and they about tyre and sidon a great multitude when they had heard what great things he did came unto him
and he spake to his disciples that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude lest they should throng him
for he had healed many insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him as many as had plagues
and unclean spirits when they saw him fell down before him and cried saying thou art the son of god
and he straitly charged them that they should not make him known
and he goeth up into a mountain and calleth unto him whom he would and they came unto him
and he ordained twelve that they should be with him and that he might send them forth to preach
and to have power to heal sicknesses and to cast out devils
and simon he surnamed peter
and james the son of zebedee and john the brother of james and he surnamed them boanerges which is the sons of thunder
and andrew and philip and bartholomew and matthew and thomas and james the son of alphaeus and thaddaeus and simon the canaanite
and judas iscariot which also betrayed him and they went into an house
and the multitude cometh together again so that they could not so much as eat bread
and when his friends heard of it they went out to lay hold on him for they said he is beside himself
and the scribes which came down from jerusalem said he hath beelzebub and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils
and he called them unto him and said unto them in parables how can satan cast out satan
and if a kingdom be divided against itself that kingdom cannot stand
and if a house be divided against itself that house cannot stand
and if satan rise up against himself and be divided he cannot stand but hath an end
no man can enter into a strong mans house and spoil his goods except he will first bind the strong man and then he will spoil his house
verily i say unto you all sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme
but he that shall blaspheme against the holy ghost hath never forgiveness but is in danger of eternal damnation
because they said he hath an unclean spirit
there came then his brethren and his mother and standing without sent unto him calling him
and the multitude sat about him and they said unto him behold thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee
and he answered them saying who is my mother or my brethren
and he looked round about on them which sat about him and said behold my mother and my brethren
for whosoever shall do the will of god the same is my brother and my sister and mother
and he began again to teach by the sea side and there was gathered unto him a great multitude so that he entered into a ship and sat in the sea and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land
and he taught them many things by parables and said unto them in his doctrine
hearken behold there went out a sower to sow
and it came to pass as he sowed some fell by the way side and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up
and some fell on stony ground where it had not much earth and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of earth
but when the sun was up it was scorched and because it had no root it withered away
and some fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it and it yielded no fruit
and other fell on good ground and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased and brought forth some thirty and some sixty and some an hundred
and he said unto them he that hath ears to hear let him hear
and when he was alone they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable
and he said unto them unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of god but unto them that are without all these things are done in parables
that seeing they may see and not perceive and hearing they may hear and not understand lest at any time they should be converted and their sins should be forgiven them
and he said unto them know ye not this parable and how then will ye know all parables
the sower soweth the word
and these are they by the way side where the word is sown but when they have heard satan cometh immediately and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts
and these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground who when they have heard the word immediately receive it with gladness
and have no root in themselves and so endure but for a time afterward when affliction or persecution ariseth for the words sake immediately they are offended
and these are they which are sown among thorns such as hear the word
and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches and the lusts of other things entering in choke the word and it becometh unfruitful
and these are they which are sown on good ground such as hear the word and receive it and bring forth fruit some thirtyfold some sixty and some an hundred
and he said unto them is a candle brought to be put under a bushel or under a bed and not to be set on a candlestick
for there is nothing hid which shall not be manifested neither was any thing kept secret but that it should come abroad
if any man have ears to hear let him hear
and he said unto them take heed what ye hear with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you and unto you that hear shall more be given
for he that hath to him shall be given and he that hath not from him shall be taken even that which he hath
and he said so is the kingdom of god as if a man should cast seed into the ground
and should sleep and rise night and day and the seed should spring and grow up he knoweth not how
for the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself first the blade then the ear after that the full corn in the ear
but when the fruit is brought forth immediately he putteth in the sickle because the harvest is come
and he said whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of god or with what comparison shall we compare it
it is like a grain of mustard seed which when it is sown in the earth is less than all the seeds that be in the earth
but when it is sown it groweth up and becometh greater than all herbs and shooteth out great branches so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it
and with many such parables spake he the word unto them as they were able to hear it
but without a parable spake he not unto them and when they were alone he expounded all things to his disciples
and the same day when the even was come he saith unto them let us pass over unto the other side
and when they had sent away the multitude they took him even as he was in the ship and there were also with him other little ships
and there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into the ship so that it was now full
and he was in the hinder part of the ship asleep on a pillow and they awake him and say unto him master carest thou not that we perish
and he arose and rebuked the wind and said unto the sea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great calm
and he said unto them why are ye so fearful how is it that ye have no faith
and they feared exceedingly and said one to another what manner of man is this that even the wind and the sea obey him
and they came over unto the other side of the sea into the country of the gadarenes
and when he was come out of the ship immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit
who had his dwelling among the tombs and no man could bind him no not with chains
because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains and the chains had been plucked asunder by him and the fetters broken in pieces neither could any man tame him
and always night and day he was in the mountains and in the tombs crying and cutting himself with stones
but when he saw jesus afar off he ran and worshipped him
and cried with a loud voice and said what have i to do with thee jesus thou son of the most high god i adjure thee by god that thou torment me not
for he said unto him come out of the man thou unclean spirit
and he asked him what is thy name and he answered saying my name is legion for we are many
and he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country
now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding
and all the devils besought him saying send us into the swine that we may enter into them
and forthwith jesus gave them leave and the unclean spirits went out and entered into the swine and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea they were about two thousand and were choked in the sea
and they that fed the swine fled and told it in the city and in the country and they went out to see what it was that was done
and they come to jesus and see him that was possessed with the devil and had the legion sitting and clothed and in his right mind and they were afraid
and they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil and also concerning the swine
and they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts
and when he was come into the ship he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him
howbeit jesus suffered him not but saith unto him go home to thy friends and tell them how great things the lord hath done for thee and hath had compassion on thee
and he departed and began to publish in decapolis how great things jesus had done for him and all men did marvel
and when jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side much people gathered unto him and he was nigh unto the sea
and behold there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue jairus by name and when he saw him he fell at his feet
and besought him greatly saying my little daughter lieth at the point of death i pray thee come and lay thy hands on her that she may be healed and she shall live
and jesus went with him and much people followed him and thronged him
and a certain woman which had an issue of blood twelve years
and had suffered many things of many physicians and had spent all that she had and was nothing bettered but rather grew worse
when she had heard of jesus came in the press behind and touched his garment
for she said if i may touch but his clothes i shall be whole
and straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague
and jesus immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him turned him about in the press and said who touched my clothes
and his disciples said unto him thou seest the multitude thronging thee and sayest thou who touched me
and he looked round about to see her that had done this thing
but the woman fearing and trembling knowing what was done in her came and fell down before him and told him all the truth
and he said unto her daughter thy faith hath made thee whole go in peace and be whole of thy plague
while he yet spake there came from the ruler of the synagogues house certain which said thy daughter is dead why troublest thou the master any further
as soon as jesus heard the word that was spoken he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue be not afraid only believe
and he suffered no man to follow him save peter and james and john the brother of james
and he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue and seeth the tumult and them that wept and wailed greatly
and when he was come in he saith unto them why make ye this ado and weep the damsel is not dead but sleepeth
and they laughed him to scorn but when he had put them all out he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel and them that were with him and entereth in where the damsel was lying
and he took the damsel by the hand and said unto her talitha cumi which is being interpreted damsel i say unto thee arise
and straightway the damsel arose and walked for she was of the age of twelve years and they were astonished with a great astonishment
and he charged them straitly that no man should know it and commanded that something should be given her to eat
and he went out from thence and came into his own country and his disciples follow him
and when the sabbath day was come he began to teach in the synagogue and many hearing him were astonished saying from whence hath this man these things and what wisdom is this which is given unto him that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands
is not this the carpenter the son of mary the brother of james and joses and of juda and simon and are not his sisters here with us and they were offended at him
but jesus said unto them a prophet is not without honour but in his own country and among his own kin and in his own house
and he could there do no mighty work save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk and healed them
and he marvelled because of their unbelief and he went round about the villages teaching
and he called unto him the twelve and began to send them forth by two and two and gave them power over unclean spirits
and commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey save a staff only no scrip no bread no money in their purse
but be shod with sandals and not put on two coats
and he said unto them in what place soever ye enter into an house there abide till ye depart from that place
and whosoever shall not receive you nor hear you when ye depart thence shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them verily i say unto you it shall be more tolerable for sodom and gomorrha in the day of judgment than for that city
and they went out and preached that men should repent
and they cast out many devils and anointed with oil many that were sick and healed them
and king herod heard of him for his name was spread abroad and he said that john the baptist was risen from the dead and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him
others said that it is elias and others said that it is a prophet or as one of the prophets
but when herod heard thereof he said it is john whom i beheaded he is risen from the dead
for herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon john and bound him in prison for herodias sake his brother philips wife for he had married her
for john had said unto herod it is not lawful for thee to have thy brothers wife
therefore herodias had a quarrel against him and would have killed him but she could not
for herod feared john knowing that he was a just man and an holy and observed him and when he heard him he did many things and heard him gladly
and when a convenient day was come that herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords high captains and chief estates of galilee
and when the daughter of the said herodias came in and danced and pleased herod and them that sat with him the king said unto the damsel ask of me whatsoever thou wilt and i will give it thee
and he sware unto her whatsoever thou shalt ask of me i will give it thee unto the half of my kingdom
and she went forth and said unto her mother what shall i ask and she said the head of john the baptist
and she came in straightway with haste unto the king and asked saying i will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of john the baptist
and the king was exceeding sorry yet for his oaths sake and for their sakes which sat with him he would not reject her
and immediately the king sent an executioner and commanded his head to be brought and he went and beheaded him in the prison
and brought his head in a charger and gave it to the damsel and the damsel gave it to her mother
and when his disciples heard of it they came and took up his corpse and laid it in a tomb
and the apostles gathered themselves together unto jesus and told him all things both what they had done and what they had taught
and he said unto them come ye yourselves apart into a desert place and rest a while for there were many coming and going and they had no leisure so much as to eat
and they departed into a desert place by ship privately
and the people saw them departing and many knew him and ran afoot thither out of all cities and outwent them and came together unto him
and jesus when he came out saw much people and was moved with compassion toward them because they were as sheep not having a shepherd and he began to teach them many things
and when the day was now far spent his disciples came unto him and said this is a desert place and now the time is far passed
send them away that they may go into the country round about and into the villages and buy themselves bread for they have nothing to eat
he answered and said unto them give ye them to eat and they say unto him shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread and give them to eat
he saith unto them how many loaves have ye go and see and when they knew they say five and two fishes
and he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass
and they sat down in ranks by hundreds and by fifties
and when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes he looked up to heaven and blessed and brake the loaves and gave them to his disciples to set before them and the two fishes divided he among them all
and they did all eat and were filled
and they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments and of the fishes
and they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men
and straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship and to go to the other side before unto bethsaida while he sent away the people
and when he had sent them away he departed into a mountain to pray
and when even was come the ship was in the midst of the sea and he alone on the land
and he saw them toiling in rowing for the wind was contrary unto them and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them walking upon the sea and would have passed by them
but when they saw him walking upon the sea they supposed it had been a spirit and cried out
for they all saw him and were troubled and immediately he talked with them and saith unto them be of good cheer it is i be not afraid
and he went up unto them into the ship and the wind ceased and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure and wondered
for they considered not the miracle of the loaves for their heart was hardened
and when they had passed over they came into the land of gennesaret and drew to the shore
and when they were come out of the ship straightway they knew him
and ran through that whole region round about and began to carry about in beds those that were sick where they heard he was
and whithersoever he entered into villages or cities or country they laid the sick in the streets and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment and as many as touched him were made whole
then came together unto him the pharisees and certain of the scribes which came from jerusalem
and when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled that is to say with unwashen hands they found fault
for the pharisees and all the jews except they wash their hands oft eat not holding the tradition of the elders
and when they come from the market except they wash they eat not and many other things there be which they have received to hold as the washing of cups and pots brasen vessels and of tables
then the pharisees and scribes asked him why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders but eat bread with unwashen hands
he answered and said unto them well hath esaias prophesied of you hypocrites as it is written this people honoureth me with their lips but their heart is far from me
howbeit in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men
for laying aside the commandment of god ye hold the tradition of men as the washing of pots and cups and many other such like things ye do
and he said unto them full well ye reject the commandment of god that ye may keep your own tradition
for moses said honour thy father and thy mother and whoso curseth father or mother let him die the death
but ye say if a man shall say to his father or mother it is corban that is to say a gift by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me he shall be free
and ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother
making the word of god of none effect through your tradition which ye have delivered and many such like things do ye
and when he had called all the people unto him he said unto them hearken unto me every one of you and understand
there is nothing from without a man that entering into him can defile him but the things which come out of him those are they that defile the man
if any man have ears to hear let him hear
and when he was entered into the house from the people his disciples asked him concerning the parable
and he saith unto them are ye so without understanding also do ye not perceive that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man it cannot defile him
because it entereth not into his heart but into the belly and goeth out into the draught purging all meats
and he said that which cometh out of the man that defileth the man
for from within out of the heart of men proceed evil thoughts adulteries fornications murders
thefts covetousness wickedness deceit lasciviousness an evil eye blasphemy pride foolishness
all these evil things come from within and defile the man
and from thence he arose and went into the borders of tyre and sidon and entered into an house and would have no man know it but he could not be hid
for a certain woman whose young daughter had an unclean spirit heard of him and came and fell at his feet
the woman was a greek a syrophenician by nation and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter
but jesus said unto her let the children first be filled for it is not meet to take the childrens bread and to cast it unto the dogs
and she answered and said unto him yes lord yet the dogs under the table eat of the childrens crumbs
and he said unto her for this saying go thy way the devil is gone out of thy daughter
and when she was come to her house she found the devil gone out and her daughter laid upon the bed
and again departing from the coasts of tyre and sidon he came unto the sea of galilee through the midst of the coasts of decapolis
and they bring unto him one that was deaf and had an impediment in his speech and they beseech him to put his hand upon him
and he took him aside from the multitude and put his fingers into his ears and he spit and touched his tongue
and looking up to heaven he sighed and saith unto him ephphatha that is be opened
and straightway his ears were opened and the string of his tongue was loosed and he spake plain
and he charged them that they should tell no man but the more he charged them so much the more a great deal they published it
and were beyond measure astonished saying he hath done all things well he maketh both the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak
in those days the multitude being very great and having nothing to eat jesus called his disciples unto him and saith unto them
i have compassion on the multitude because they have now been with me three days and have nothing to eat
and if i send them away fasting to their own houses they will faint by the way for divers of them came from far
and his disciples answered him from whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness
and he asked them how many loaves have ye and they said seven
and he commanded the people to sit down on the ground and he took the seven loaves and gave thanks and brake and gave to his disciples to set before them and they did set them before the people
and they had a few small fishes and he blessed and commanded to set them also before them
so they did eat and were filled and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets
and they that had eaten were about four thousand and he sent them away
and straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples and came into the parts of dalmanutha
and the pharisees came forth and began to question with him seeking of him a sign from heaven tempting him
and he sighed deeply in his spirit and saith why doth this generation seek after a sign verily i say unto you there shall no sign be given unto this generation
and he left them and entering into the ship again departed to the other side
now the disciples had forgotten to take bread neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf
and he charged them saying take heed beware of the leaven of the pharisees and of the leaven of herod
and they reasoned among themselves saying it is because we have no bread
and when jesus knew it he saith unto them why reason ye because ye have no bread perceive ye not yet neither understand have ye your heart yet hardened
having eyes see ye not and having ears hear ye not and do ye not remember
when i brake the five loaves among five thousand how many baskets full of fragments took ye up they say unto him twelve
and when the seven among four thousand how many baskets full of fragments took ye up and they said seven
and he said unto them how is it that ye do not understand
and he cometh to bethsaida and they bring a blind man unto him and besought him to touch him
and he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the town and when he had spit on his eyes and put his hands upon him he asked him if he saw ought
and he looked up and said i see men as trees walking
after that he put his hands again upon his eyes and made him look up and he was restored and saw every man clearly
and he sent him away to his house saying neither go into the town nor tell it to any in the town
and jesus went out and his disciples into the towns of caesarea philippi and by the way he asked his disciples saying unto them whom do men say that i am
and they answered john the baptist but some say elias and others one of the prophets
and he saith unto them but whom say ye that i am and peter answereth and saith unto him thou art the christ
and he charged them that they should tell no man of him
and he began to teach them that the son of man must suffer many things and be rejected of the elders and of the chief priests and scribes and be killed and after three days rise again
and he spake that saying openly and peter took him and began to rebuke him
but when he had turned about and looked on his disciples he rebuked peter saying get thee behind me satan for thou savourest not the things that be of god but the things that be of men
and when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also he said unto them whosoever will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me
for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospels the same shall save it
for what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul
or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul
whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation of him also shall the son of man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his father with the holy angels
and he said unto them verily i say unto you that there be some of them that stand here which shall not taste of death till they have seen the kingdom of god come with power
and after six days jesus taketh with him peter and james and john and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves and he was transfigured before them
and his raiment became shining exceeding white as snow so as no fuller on earth can white them
and there appeared unto them elias with moses and they were talking with jesus
and peter answered and said to jesus master it is good for us to be here and let us make three tabernacles one for thee and one for moses and one for elias
for he wist not what to say for they were sore afraid
and there was a cloud that overshadowed them and a voice came out of the cloud saying this is my beloved son hear him
and suddenly when they had looked round about they saw no man any more save jesus only with themselves
and as they came down from the mountain he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen till the son of man were risen from the dead
and they kept that saying with themselves questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean
and they asked him saying why say the scribes that elias must first come
and he answered and told them elias verily cometh first and restoreth all things and how it is written of the son of man that he must suffer many things and be set at nought
but i say unto you that elias is indeed come and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed as it is written of him
and when he came to his disciples he saw a great multitude about them and the scribes questioning with them
and straightway all the people when they beheld him were greatly amazed and running to him saluted him
and he asked the scribes what question ye with them
and one of the multitude answered and said master i have brought unto thee my son which hath a dumb spirit
and wheresoever he taketh him he teareth him and he foameth and gnasheth with his teeth and pineth away and i spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out and they could not
he answereth him and saith o faithless generation how long shall i be with you how long shall i suffer you bring him unto me
and they brought him unto him and when he saw him straightway the spirit tare him and he fell on the ground and wallowed foaming
and he asked his father how long is it ago since this came unto him and he said of a child
and ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire and into the waters to destroy him but if thou canst do any thing have compassion on us and help us
jesus said unto him if thou canst believe all things are possible to him that believeth
and straightway the father of the child cried out and said with tears lord i believe help thou mine unbelief
when jesus saw that the people came running together he rebuked the foul spirit saying unto him thou dumb and deaf spirit i charge thee come out of him and enter no more into him
and the spirit cried and rent him sore and came out of him and he was as one dead insomuch that many said he is dead
but jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up and he arose
and when he was come into the house his disciples asked him privately why could not we cast him out
and he said unto them this kind can come forth by nothing but by prayer and fasting
and they departed thence and passed through galilee and he would not that any man should know it
for he taught his disciples and said unto them the son of man is delivered into the hands of men and they shall kill him and after that he is killed he shall rise the third day
but they understood not that saying and were afraid to ask him
and he came to capernaum and being in the house he asked them what was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way
but they held their peace for by the way they had disputed among themselves who should be the greatest
and he sat down and called the twelve and saith unto them if any man desire to be first the same shall be last of all and servant of all
and he took a child and set him in the midst of them and when he had taken him in his arms he said unto them
whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name receiveth me and whosoever shall receive me receiveth not me but him that sent me
and john answered him saying master we saw one casting out devils in thy name and he followeth not us and we forbad him because he followeth not us
but jesus said forbid him not for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name that can lightly speak evil of me
for he that is not against us is on our part
for whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name because ye belong to christ verily i say unto you he shall not lose his reward
and whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he were cast into the sea
and if thy hand offend thee cut it off it is better for thee to enter into life maimed than having two hands to go into hell into the fire that never shall be quenched
where their worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched
and if thy foot offend thee cut it off it is better for thee to enter halt into life than having two feet to be cast into hell into the fire that never shall be quenched
where their worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched
and if thine eye offend thee pluck it out it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of god with one eye than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire
where their worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched
for every one shall be salted with fire and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt
salt is good but if the salt have lost his saltness wherewith will ye season it have salt in yourselves and have peace one with another
and he arose from thence and cometh into the coasts of judaea by the farther side of jordan and the people resort unto him again and as he was wont he taught them again
and the pharisees came to him and asked him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife tempting him
and he answered and said unto them what did moses command you
and they said moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement and to put her away
and jesus answered and said unto them for the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept
but from the beginning of the creation god made them male and female
for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife
and they twain shall be one flesh so then they are no more twain but one flesh
what therefore god hath joined together let not man put asunder
and in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter
and he saith unto them whosoever shall put away his wife and marry another committeth adultery against her
and if a woman shall put away her husband and be married to another she committeth adultery
and they brought young children to him that he should touch them and his disciples rebuked those that brought them
but when jesus saw it he was much displeased and said unto them suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of god
verily i say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god as a little child he shall not enter therein
and he took them up in his arms put his hands upon them and blessed them
and when he was gone forth into the way there came one running and kneeled to him and asked him good master what shall i do that i may inherit eternal life
and jesus said unto him why callest thou me good there is none good but one that is god
thou knowest the commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness defraud not honour thy father and mother
and he answered and said unto him master all these have i observed from my youth
then jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him one thing thou lackest go thy way sell whatsoever thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me
and he was sad at that saying and went away grieved for he had great possessions
and jesus looked round about and saith unto his disciples how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god
and the disciples were astonished at his words but jesus answereth again and saith unto them children how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of god
it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god
and they were astonished out of measure saying among themselves who then can be saved
and jesus looking upon them saith with men it is impossible but not with god for with god all things are possible
then peter began to say unto him lo we have left all and have followed thee
and jesus answered and said verily i say unto you there is no man that hath left house or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my sake and the gospels
but he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time houses and brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands with persecutions and in the world to come eternal life
but many that are first shall be last and the last first
and they were in the way going up to jerusalem and jesus went before them and they were amazed and as they followed they were afraid and he took again the twelve and began to tell them what things should happen unto him
saying behold we go up to jerusalem and the son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and unto the scribes and they shall condemn him to death and shall deliver him to the gentiles
and they shall mock him and shall scourge him and shall spit upon him and shall kill him and the third day he shall rise again
and james and john the sons of zebedee come unto him saying master we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire
and he said unto them what would ye that i should do for you
they said unto him grant unto us that we may sit one on thy right hand and the other on thy left hand in thy glory
but jesus said unto them ye know not what ye ask can ye drink of the cup that i drink of and be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with
and they said unto him we can and jesus said unto them ye shall indeed drink of the cup that i drink of and with the baptism that i am baptized withal shall ye be baptized
but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared
and when the ten heard it they began to be much displeased with james and john
but jesus called them to him and saith unto them ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the gentiles exercise lordship over them and their great ones exercise authority upon them
but so shall it not be among you but whosoever will be great among you shall be your minister
and whosoever of you will be the chiefest shall be servant of all
for even the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many
and they came to jericho and as he went out of jericho with his disciples and a great number of people blind bartimaeus the son of timaeus sat by the highway side begging
and when he heard that it was jesus of nazareth he began to cry out and say jesus thou son of david have mercy on me
and many charged him that he should hold his peace but he cried the more a great deal thou son of david have mercy on me
and jesus stood still and commanded him to be called and they call the blind man saying unto him be of good comfort rise he calleth thee
and he casting away his garment rose and came to jesus
and jesus answered and said unto him what wilt thou that i should do unto thee the blind man said unto him lord that i might receive my sight
and jesus said unto him go thy way thy faith hath made thee whole and immediately he received his sight and followed jesus in the way
and when they came nigh to jerusalem unto bethphage and bethany at the mount of olives he sendeth forth two of his disciples
and saith unto them go your way into the village over against you and as soon as ye be entered into it ye shall find a colt tied whereon never man sat loose him and bring him
and if any man say unto you why do ye this say ye that the lord hath need of him and straightway he will send him hither
and they went their way and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met and they loose him
and certain of them that stood there said unto them what do ye loosing the colt
and they said unto them even as jesus had commanded and they let them go
and they brought the colt to jesus and cast their garments on him and he sat upon him
and many spread their garments in the way and others cut down branches off the trees and strawed them in the way
and they that went before and they that followed cried saying hosanna blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord
blessed be the kingdom of our father david that cometh in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest
and jesus entered into jerusalem and into the temple and when he had looked round about upon all things and now the eventide was come he went out unto bethany with the twelve
and on the morrow when they were come from bethany he was hungry
and seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves he came if haply he might find any thing thereon and when he came to it he found nothing but leaves for the time of figs was not yet
and jesus answered and said unto it no man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever and his disciples heard it
and they come to jerusalem and jesus went into the temple and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of them that sold doves
and would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple
and he taught saying unto them is it not written my house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer but ye have made it a den of thieves
and the scribes and chief priests heard it and sought how they might destroy him for they feared him because all the people was astonished at his doctrine
and when even was come he went out of the city
and in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots
and peter calling to remembrance saith unto him master behold the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away
and jesus answering saith unto them have faith in god
for verily i say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith
therefore i say unto you what things soever ye desire when ye pray believe that ye receive them and ye shall have them
and when ye stand praying forgive if ye have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses
but if ye do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses
and they come again to jerusalem and as he was walking in the temple there come to him the chief priests and the scribes and the elders
and say unto him by what authority doest thou these things and who gave thee this authority to do these things
and jesus answered and said unto them i will also ask of you one question and answer me and i will tell you by what authority i do these things
the baptism of john was it from heaven or of men answer me
and they reasoned with themselves saying if we shall say from heaven he will say why then did ye not believe him
but if we shall say of men they feared the people for all men counted john that he was a prophet indeed
and they answered and said unto jesus we cannot tell and jesus answering saith unto them neither do i tell you by what authority i do these things
and he began to speak unto them by parables a certain man planted a vineyard and set an hedge about it and digged a place for the winefat and built a tower and let it out to husbandmen and went into a far country
and at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard
and they caught him and beat him and sent him away empty
and again he sent unto them another servant and at him they cast stones and wounded him in the head and sent him away shamefully handled
and again he sent another and him they killed and many others beating some and killing some
having yet therefore one son his wellbeloved he sent him also last unto them saying they will reverence my son
but those husbandmen said among themselves this is the heir come let us kill him and the inheritance shall be ours
and they took him and killed him and cast him out of the vineyard
what shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do he will come and destroy the husbandmen and will give the vineyard unto others
and have ye not read this scripture the stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner
this was the lords doing and it is marvellous in our eyes
and they sought to lay hold on him but feared the people for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them and they left him and went their way
and they send unto him certain of the pharisees and of the herodians to catch him in his words
and when they were come they say unto him master we know that thou art true and carest for no man for thou regardest not the person of men but teachest the way of god in truth is it lawful to give tribute to caesar or not
shall we give or shall we not give but he knowing their hypocrisy said unto them why tempt ye me bring me a penny that i may see it
and they brought it and he saith unto them whose is this image and superscription and they said unto him caesars
and jesus answering said unto them render to caesar the things that are caesars and to god the things that are gods and they marvelled at him
then come unto him the sadducees which say there is no resurrection and they asked him saying
master moses wrote unto us if a mans brother die and leave his wife behind him and leave no children that his brother should take his wife and raise up seed unto his brother
now there were seven brethren and the first took a wife and dying left no seed
and the second took her and died neither left he any seed and the third likewise
and the seven had her and left no seed last of all the woman died also
in the resurrection therefore when they shall rise whose wife shall she be of them for the seven had her to wife
and jesus answering said unto them do ye not therefore err because ye know not the scriptures neither the power of god
for when they shall rise from the dead they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as the angels which are in heaven
and as touching the dead that they rise have ye not read in the book of moses how in the bush god spake unto him saying i am the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob
he is not the god of the dead but the god of the living ye therefore do greatly err
and one of the scribes came and having heard them reasoning together and perceiving that he had answered them well asked him which is the first commandment of all
and jesus answered him the first of all the commandments is hear o israel the lord our god is one lord
and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength this is the first commandment
and the second is like namely this thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself there is none other commandment greater than these
and the scribe said unto him well master thou hast said the truth for there is one god and there is none other but he
and to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the soul and with all the strength and to love his neighbour as himself is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices
and when jesus saw that he answered discreetly he said unto him thou art not far from the kingdom of god and no man after that durst ask him any question
and jesus answered and said while he taught in the temple how say the scribes that christ is the son of david
for david himself said by the holy ghost the lord said to my lord sit thou on my right hand till i make thine enemies thy footstool
david therefore himself calleth him lord and whence is he then his son and the common people heard him gladly
and he said unto them in his doctrine beware of the scribes which love to go in long clothing and love salutations in the marketplaces
and the chief seats in the synagogues and the uppermost rooms at feasts
which devour widows houses and for a pretence make long prayers these shall receive greater damnation
and jesus sat over against the treasury and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury and many that were rich cast in much
and there came a certain poor widow and she threw in two mites which make a farthing
and he called unto him his disciples and saith unto them verily i say unto you that this poor widow hath cast more in than all they which have cast into the treasury
for all they did cast in of their abundance but she of her want did cast in all that she had even all her living
and as he went out of the temple one of his disciples saith unto him master see what manner of stones and what buildings are here
and jesus answering said unto him seest thou these great buildings there shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down
and as he sat upon the mount of olives over against the temple peter and james and john and andrew asked him privately
tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled
and jesus answering them began to say take heed lest any man deceive you
for many shall come in my name saying i am christ and shall deceive many
and when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars be ye not troubled for such things must needs be but the end shall not be yet
for nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there shall be earthquakes in divers places and there shall be famines and troubles these are the beginnings of sorrows
but take heed to yourselves for they shall deliver you up to councils and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake for a testimony against them
and the gospel must first be published among all nations
but when they shall lead you and deliver you up take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak neither do ye premeditate but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour that speak ye for it is not ye that speak but the holy ghost
now the brother shall betray the brother to death and the father the son and children shall rise up against their parents and shall cause them to be put to death
and ye shall be hated of all men for my names sake but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved
but when ye shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by daniel the prophet standing where it ought not let him that readeth understand then let them that be in judaea flee to the mountains
and let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house neither enter therein to take any thing out of his house
and let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment
but woe to them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days
and pray ye that your flight be not in the winter
for in those days shall be affliction such as was not from the beginning of the creation which god created unto this time neither shall be
and except that the lord had shortened those days no flesh should be saved but for the elects sake whom he hath chosen he hath shortened the days
and then if any man shall say to you lo here is christ or lo he is there believe him not
for false christs and false prophets shall rise and shall shew signs and wonders to seduce if it were possible even the elect
but take ye heed behold i have foretold you all things
but in those days after that tribulation the sun shall be darkened and the moon shall not give her light
and the stars of heaven shall fall and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken
and then shall they see the son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory
and then shall he send his angels and shall gather together his elect from the four winds from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven
now learn a parable of the fig tree when her branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves ye know that summer is near
so ye in like manner when ye shall see these things come to pass know that it is nigh even at the doors
verily i say unto you that this generation shall not pass till all these things be done
heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away
but of that day and that hour knoweth no man no not the angels which are in heaven neither the son but the father
take ye heed watch and pray for ye know not when the time is
for the son of man is as a man taking a far journey who left his house and gave authority to his servants and to every man his work and commanded the porter to watch
watch ye therefore for ye know not when the master of the house cometh at even or at midnight or at the cockcrowing or in the morning
lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping
and what i say unto you i say unto all watch
after two days was the feast of the passover and of unleavened bread and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft and put him to death
but they said not on the feast day lest there be an uproar of the people
and being in bethany in the house of simon the leper as he sat at meat there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious and she brake the box and poured it on his head
and there were some that had indignation within themselves and said why was this waste of the ointment made
for it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence and have been given to the poor and they murmured against her
and jesus said let her alone why trouble ye her she hath wrought a good work on me
for ye have the poor with you always and whensoever ye will ye may do them good but me ye have not always
she hath done what she could she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying
verily i say unto you wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her
and judas iscariot one of the twelve went unto the chief priests to betray him unto them
and when they heard it they were glad and promised to give him money and he sought how he might conveniently betray him
and the first day of unleavened bread when they killed the passover his disciples said unto him where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover
and he sendeth forth two of his disciples and saith unto them go ye into the city and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water follow him
and wheresoever he shall go in say ye to the goodman of the house the master saith where is the guestchamber where i shall eat the passover with my disciples
and he will shew you a large upper room furnished and prepared there make ready for us
and his disciples went forth and came into the city and found as he had said unto them and they made ready the passover
and in the evening he cometh with the twelve
and as they sat and did eat jesus said verily i say unto you one of you which eateth with me shall betray me
and they began to be sorrowful and to say unto him one by one is it i and another said is it i
and he answered and said unto them it is one of the twelve that dippeth with me in the dish
the son of man indeed goeth as it is written of him but woe to that man by whom the son of man is betrayed good were it for that man if he had never been born
and as they did eat jesus took bread and blessed and brake it and gave to them and said take eat this is my body
and he took the cup and when he had given thanks he gave it to them and they all drank of it
and he said unto them this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many
verily i say unto you i will drink no more of the fruit of the vine until that day that i drink it new in the kingdom of god
and when they had sung an hymn they went out into the mount of olives
and jesus saith unto them all ye shall be offended because of me this night for it is written i will smite the shepherd and the sheep shall be scattered
but after that i am risen i will go before you into galilee
but peter said unto him although all shall be offended yet will not i
and jesus saith unto him verily i say unto thee that this day even in this night before the cock crow twice thou shalt deny me thrice
but he spake the more vehemently if i should die with thee i will not deny thee in any wise likewise also said they all
and they came to a place which was named gethsemane and he saith to his disciples sit ye here while i shall pray
and he taketh with him peter and james and john and began to be sore amazed and to be very heavy
and saith unto them my soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death tarry ye here and watch
and he went forward a little and fell on the ground and prayed that if it were possible the hour might pass from him
and he said abba father all things are possible unto thee take away this cup from me nevertheless not what i will but what thou wilt
and he cometh and findeth them sleeping and saith unto peter simon sleepest thou couldest not thou watch one hour
watch ye and pray lest ye enter into temptation the spirit truly is ready but the flesh is weak
and again he went away and prayed and spake the same words
and when he returned he found them asleep again for their eyes were heavy neither wist they what to answer him
and he cometh the third time and saith unto them sleep on now and take your rest it is enough the hour is come behold the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners
rise up let us go lo he that betrayeth me is at hand
and immediately while he yet spake cometh judas one of the twelve and with him a great multitude with swords and staves from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders
and he that betrayed him had given them a token saying whomsoever i shall kiss that same is he take him and lead him away safely
and as soon as he was come he goeth straightway to him and saith master master and kissed him
and they laid their hands on him and took him
and one of them that stood by drew a sword and smote a servant of the high priest and cut off his ear
and jesus answered and said unto them are ye come out as against a thief with swords and with staves to take me
i was daily with you in the temple teaching and ye took me not but the scriptures must be fulfilled
and they all forsook him and fled
and there followed him a certain young man having a linen cloth cast about his naked body and the young men laid hold on him
and he left the linen cloth and fled from them naked
and they led jesus away to the high priest and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes
and peter followed him afar off even into the palace of the high priest and he sat with the servants and warmed himself at the fire
and the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against jesus to put him to death and found none
for many bare false witness against him but their witness agreed not together
and there arose certain and bare false witness against him saying
we heard him say i will destroy this temple that is made with hands and within three days i will build another made without hands
but neither so did their witness agree together
and the high priest stood up in the midst and asked jesus saying answerest thou nothing what is it which these witness against thee
but he held his peace and answered nothing again the high priest asked him and said unto him art thou the christ the son of the blessed
and jesus said i am and ye shall see the son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of heaven
then the high priest rent his clothes and saith what need we any further witnesses
ye have heard the blasphemy what think ye and they all condemned him to be guilty of death
and some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to buffet him and to say unto him prophesy and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands
and as peter was beneath in the palace there cometh one of the maids of the high priest
and when she saw peter warming himself she looked upon him and said and thou also wast with jesus of nazareth
but he denied saying i know not neither understand i what thou sayest and he went out into the porch and the cock crew
and a maid saw him again and began to say to them that stood by this is one of them
and he denied it again and a little after they that stood by said again to peter surely thou art one of them for thou art a galilaean and thy speech agreeth thereto
but he began to curse and to swear saying i know not this man of whom ye speak
and the second time the cock crew and peter called to mind the word that jesus said unto him before the cock crow twice thou shalt deny me thrice and when he thought thereon he wept
and straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council and bound jesus and carried him away and delivered him to pilate
and pilate asked him art thou the king of the jews and he answering said unto them thou sayest it
and the chief priests accused him of many things but he answered nothing
and pilate asked him again saying answerest thou nothing behold how many things they witness against thee
but jesus yet answered nothing so that pilate marvelled
now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner whomsoever they desired
and there was one named barabbas which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him who had committed murder in the insurrection
and the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them
but pilate answered them saying will ye that i release unto you the king of the jews
for he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy
but the chief priests moved the people that he should rather release barabbas unto them
and pilate answered and said again unto them what will ye then that i shall do unto him whom ye call the king of the jews
and they cried out again crucify him
then pilate said unto them why what evil hath he done and they cried out the more exceedingly crucify him
and so pilate willing to content the people released barabbas unto them and delivered jesus when he had scourged him to be crucified
and the soldiers led him away into the hall called praetorium and they call together the whole band
and they clothed him with purple and platted a crown of thorns and put it about his head
and began to salute him hail king of the jews
and they smote him on the head with a reed and did spit upon him and bowing their knees worshipped him
and when they had mocked him they took off the purple from him and put his own clothes on him and led him out to crucify him
and they compel one simon a cyrenian who passed by coming out of the country the father of alexander and rufus to bear his cross
and they bring him unto the place golgotha which is being interpreted the place of a skull
and they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh but he received it not
and when they had crucified him they parted his garments casting lots upon them what every man should take
and it was the third hour and they crucified him
and the superscription of his accusation was written over the king of the jews
and with him they crucify two thieves the one on his right hand and the other on his left
and the scripture was fulfilled which saith and he was numbered with the transgressors
and they that passed by railed on him wagging their heads and saying ah thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it in three days
save thyself and come down from the cross
likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes he saved others himself he cannot save
let christ the king of israel descend now from the cross that we may see and believe and they that were crucified with him reviled him
and when the sixth hour was come there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour
and at the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice saying eloi eloi lama sabachthani which is being interpreted my god my god why hast thou forsaken me
and some of them that stood by when they heard it said behold he calleth elias
and one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar and put it on a reed and gave him to drink saying let alone let us see whether elias will come to take him down
and jesus cried with a loud voice and gave up the ghost
and the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom
and when the centurion which stood over against him saw that he so cried out and gave up the ghost he said truly this man was the son of god
there were also women looking on afar off among whom was mary magdalene and mary the mother of james the less and of joses and salome
who also when he was in galilee followed him and ministered unto him and many other women which came up with him unto jerusalem
and now when the even was come because it was the preparation that is the day before the sabbath
joseph of arimathaea an honourable counsellor which also waited for the kingdom of god came and went in boldly unto pilate and craved the body of jesus
and pilate marvelled if he were already dead and calling unto him the centurion he asked him whether he had been any while dead
and when he knew it of the centurion he gave the body to joseph
and he bought fine linen and took him down and wrapped him in the linen and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre
and mary magdalene and mary the mother of joses beheld where he was laid
and when the sabbath was past mary magdalene and mary the mother of james and salome had bought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him
and very early in the morning the first day of the week they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun
and they said among themselves who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre
and when they looked they saw that the stone was rolled away for it was very great
and entering into the sepulchre they saw a young man sitting on the right side clothed in a long white garment and they were affrighted
and he saith unto them be not affrighted ye seek jesus of nazareth which was crucified he is risen he is not here behold the place where they laid him
but go your way tell his disciples and peter that he goeth before you into galilee there shall ye see him as he said unto you
and they went out quickly and fled from the sepulchre for they trembled and were amazed neither said they any thing to any man for they were afraid
now when jesus was risen early the first day of the week he appeared first to mary magdalene out of whom he had cast seven devils
and she went and told them that had been with him as they mourned and wept
and they when they had heard that he was alive and had been seen of her believed not
after that he appeared in another form unto two of them as they walked and went into the country
and they went and told it unto the residue neither believed they them
afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen
and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature
he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned
and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues
they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover
so then after the lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of god
and they went forth and preached every where the lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following amen
simon peter a servant and an apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our saviour jesus christ
grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord
according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue
whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust
and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge
and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness
and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity
for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ
but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins
wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if ye do these things ye shall never fall
for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and saviour jesus christ
wherefore i will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though ye know them and be established in the present truth
yea i think it meet as long as i am in this tabernacle to stir you up by putting you in remembrance
knowing that shortly i must put off this my tabernacle even as our lord jesus christ hath shewed me
moreover i will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance
for we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our lord jesus christ but were eyewitnesses of his majesty
for he received from god the father honour and glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased
and this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with him in the holy mount
we have also a more sure word of prophecy whereunto ye do well that ye take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts
knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation
for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of god spake as they were moved by the holy ghost
but there were false prophets also among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you who privily shall bring in damnable heresies even denying the lord that bought them and bring upon themselves swift destruction
and many shall follow their pernicious ways by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of
and through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not and their damnation slumbereth not
for if god spared not the angels that sinned but cast them down to hell and delivered them into chains of darkness to be reserved unto judgment
and spared not the old world but saved noah the eighth person a preacher of righteousness bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly
and turning the cities of sodom and gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly
and delivered just lot vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked
for that righteous man dwelling among them in seeing and hearing vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds
the lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished
but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and despise government presumptuous are they selfwilled they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities
whereas angels which are greater in power and might bring not railing accusation against them before the lord
but these as natural brute beasts made to be taken and destroyed speak evil of the things that they understand not and shall utterly perish in their own corruption
and shall receive the reward of unrighteousness as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time spots they are and blemishes sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you
having eyes full of adultery and that cannot cease from sin beguiling unstable souls an heart they have exercised with covetous practices cursed children
which have forsaken the right way and are gone astray following the way of balaam the son of bosor who loved the wages of unrighteousness
but was rebuked for his iniquity the dumb ass speaking with mans voice forbad the madness of the prophet
these are wells without water clouds that are carried with a tempest to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever
for when they speak great swelling words of vanity they allure through the lusts of the flesh through much wantonness those that were clean escaped from them who live in error
while they promise them liberty they themselves are the servants of corruption for of whom a man is overcome of the same is he brought in bondage
for if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the lord and saviour jesus christ they are again entangled therein and overcome the latter end is worse with them than the beginning
for it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than after they have known it to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them
but it is happened unto them according to the true proverb the dog is turned to his own vomit again and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire
this second epistle beloved i now write unto you in both which i stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance
that ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the commandment of us the apostles of the lord and saviour
knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lusts
and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation
for this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of god the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water and in the water
whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished
but the heavens and the earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men
but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day
the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is longsuffering to usward not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance
but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up
seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness
looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of god wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat
nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness
wherefore beloved seeing that ye look for such things be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless
and account that the longsuffering of our lord is salvation even as our beloved brother paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you
as also in all his epistles speaking in them of these things in which are some things hard to be understood which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest as they do also the other scriptures unto their own destruction
ye therefore beloved seeing ye know these things before beware lest ye also being led away with the error of the wicked fall from your own stedfastness
but grow in grace and in the knowledge of our lord and saviour jesus christ to him be glory both now and for ever amen
jude the servant of jesus christ and brother of james to them that are sanctified by god the father and preserved in jesus christ and called
mercy unto you and peace and love be multiplied
beloved when i gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints
for there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our god into lasciviousness and denying the only lord god and our lord jesus christ
i will therefore put you in remembrance though ye once knew this how that the lord having saved the people out of the land of egypt afterward destroyed them that believed not
and the angels which kept not their first estate but left their own habitation he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day
even as sodom and gomorrha and the cities about them in like manner giving themselves over to fornication and going after strange flesh are set forth for an example suffering the vengeance of eternal fire
likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh despise dominion and speak evil of dignities
yet michael the archangel when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of moses durst not bring against him a railing accusation but said the lord rebuke thee
but these speak evil of those things which they know not but what they know naturally as brute beasts in those things they corrupt themselves
woe unto them for they have gone in the way of cain and ran greedily after the error of balaam for reward and perished in the gainsaying of core
these are spots in your feasts of charity when they feast with you feeding themselves without fear clouds they are without water carried about of winds trees whose fruit withereth without fruit twice dead plucked up by the roots
raging waves of the sea foaming out their own shame wandering stars to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever
and enoch also the seventh from adam prophesied of these saying behold the lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints
to execute judgment upon all and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him
these are murmurers complainers walking after their own lusts and their mouth speaketh great swelling words having mens persons in admiration because of advantage
but beloved remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our lord jesus christ
how that they told you there should be mockers in the last time who should walk after their own ungodly lusts
these be they who separate themselves sensual having not the spirit
but ye beloved building up yourselves on your most holy faith praying in the holy ghost
keep yourselves in the love of god looking for the mercy of our lord jesus christ unto eternal life
and of some have compassion making a difference
and others save with fear pulling them out of the fire hating even the garment spotted by the flesh
now unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy
to the only wise god our saviour be glory and majesty dominion and power both now and ever amen
james a servant of god and of the lord jesus christ to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad greeting
my brethren count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations
knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience
but let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothing
if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of god that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not and it shall be given him
but let him ask in faith nothing wavering for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed
for let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the lord
a double minded man is unstable in all his ways
let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted
but the rich in that he is made low because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away
for the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat but it withereth the grass and the flower thereof falleth and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways
blessed is the man that endureth temptation for when he is tried he shall receive the crown of life which the lord hath promised to them that love him
let no man say when he is tempted i am tempted of god for god cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man
but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed
then when lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death
do not err my beloved brethren
every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the father of lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning
of his own will begat he us with the word of truth that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures
wherefore my beloved brethren let every man be swift to hear slow to speak slow to wrath
for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of god
wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness and receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your souls
but be ye doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own selves
for if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass
for he beholdeth himself and goeth his way and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was
but whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty and continueth therein he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed
if any man among you seem to be religious and bridleth not his tongue but deceiveth his own heart this mans religion is vain
pure religion and undefiled before god and the father is this to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the world
my brethren have not the faith of our lord jesus christ the lord of glory with respect of persons
for if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring in goodly apparel and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment
and ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing and say unto him sit thou here in a good place and say to the poor stand thou there or sit here under my footstool
are ye not then partial in yourselves and are become judges of evil thoughts
hearken my beloved brethren hath not god chosen the poor of this world rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him
but ye have despised the poor do not rich men oppress you and draw you before the judgment seats
do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called
if ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself ye do well
but if ye have respect to persons ye commit sin and are convinced of the law as transgressors
for whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point he is guilty of all
for he that said do not commit adultery said also do not kill now if thou commit no adultery yet if thou kill thou art become a transgressor of the law
so speak ye and so do as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty
for he shall have judgment without mercy that hath shewed no mercy and mercy rejoiceth against judgment
what doth it profit my brethren though a man say he hath faith and have not works can faith save him
if a brother or sister be naked and destitute of daily food
and one of you say unto them depart in peace be ye warmed and filled notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body what doth it profit
even so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone
yea a man may say thou hast faith and i have works shew me thy faith without thy works and i will shew thee my faith by my works
thou believest that there is one god thou doest well the devils also believe and tremble
but wilt thou know o vain man that faith without works is dead
was not abraham our father justified by works when he had offered isaac his son upon the altar
seest thou how faith wrought with his works and by works was faith made perfect
and the scripture was fulfilled which saith abraham believed god and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of god
ye see then how that by works a man is justified and not by faith only
likewise also was not rahab the harlot justified by works when she had received the messengers and had sent them out another way
for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also
my brethren be not many masters knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation
for in many things we offend all if any man offend not in word the same is a perfect man and able also to bridle the whole body
behold we put bits in the horses mouths that they may obey us and we turn about their whole body
behold also the ships which though they be so great and are driven of fierce winds yet are they turned about with a very small helm whithersoever the governor listeth
even so the tongue is a little member and boasteth great things behold how great a matter a little fire kindleth
and the tongue is a fire a world of iniquity so is the tongue among our members that it defileth the whole body and setteth on fire the course of nature and it is set on fire of hell
for every kind of beasts and of birds and of serpents and of things in the sea is tamed and hath been tamed of mankind
but the tongue can no man tame it is an unruly evil full of deadly poison
therewith bless we god even the father and therewith curse we men which are made after the similitude of god
out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing my brethren these things ought not so to be
doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter
can the fig tree my brethren bear olive berries either a vine figs so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh
who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom
but if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts glory not and lie not against the truth
this wisdom descendeth not from above but is earthly sensual devilish
for where envying and strife is there is confusion and every evil work
but the wisdom that is from above is first pure then peaceable gentle and easy to be intreated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisy
and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace
from whence come wars and fightings among you come they not hence even of your lusts that war in your members
ye lust and have not ye kill and desire to have and cannot obtain ye fight and war yet ye have not because ye ask not
ye ask and receive not because ye ask amiss that ye may consume it upon your lusts
ye adulterers and adulteresses know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with god whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of god
do ye think that the scripture saith in vain the spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy
but he giveth more grace wherefore he saith god resisteth the proud but giveth grace unto the humble
submit yourselves therefore to god resist the devil and he will flee from you
draw nigh to god and he will draw nigh to you cleanse your hands ye sinners and purify your hearts ye double minded
be afflicted and mourn and weep let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to heaviness
humble yourselves in the sight of the lord and he shall lift you up
speak not evil one of another brethren he that speaketh evil of his brother and judgeth his brother speaketh evil of the law and judgeth the law but if thou judge the law thou art not a doer of the law but a judge
there is one lawgiver who is able to save and to destroy who art thou that judgest another
go to now ye that say to day or to morrow we will go into such a city and continue there a year and buy and sell and get gain
whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow for what is your life it is even a vapour that appeareth for a little time and then vanisheth away
for that ye ought to say if the lord will we shall live and do this or that
but now ye rejoice in your boastings all such rejoicing is evil
therefore to him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it is sin
go to now ye rich men weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you
your riches are corrupted and your garments are motheaten
your gold and silver is cankered and the rust of them shall be a witness against you and shall eat your flesh as it were fire ye have heaped treasure together for the last days
behold the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields which is of you kept back by fraud crieth and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the lord of sabaoth
ye have lived in pleasure on the earth and been wanton ye have nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter
ye have condemned and killed the just and he doth not resist you
be patient therefore brethren unto the coming of the lord behold the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth and hath long patience for it until he receive the early and latter rain
be ye also patient stablish your hearts for the coming of the lord draweth nigh
grudge not one against another brethren lest ye be condemned behold the judge standeth before the door
take my brethren the prophets who have spoken in the name of the lord for an example of suffering affliction and of patience
behold we count them happy which endure ye have heard of the patience of job and have seen the end of the lord that the lord is very pitiful and of tender mercy
but above all things my brethren swear not neither by heaven neither by the earth neither by any other oath but let your yea be yea and your nay nay lest ye fall into condemnation
is any among you afflicted let him pray is any merry let him sing psalms
is any sick among you let him call for the elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the lord
and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the lord shall raise him up and if he have committed sins they shall be forgiven him
confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that ye may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much
elias was a man subject to like passions as we are and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months
and he prayed again and the heaven gave rain and the earth brought forth her fruit
brethren if any of you do err from the truth and one convert him
let him know that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death and shall hide a multitude of sins
paul a prisoner of jesus christ and timothy our brother unto philemon our dearly beloved and fellowlabourer
and to our beloved apphia and archippus our fellowsoldier and to the church in thy house
grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
i thank my god making mention of thee always in my prayers
hearing of thy love and faith which thou hast toward the lord jesus and toward all saints
that the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in christ jesus
for we have great joy and consolation in thy love because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee brother
wherefore though i might be much bold in christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient
yet for loves sake i rather beseech thee being such an one as paul the aged and now also a prisoner of jesus christ
i beseech thee for my son onesimus whom i have begotten in my bonds
which in time past was to thee unprofitable but now profitable to thee and to me
whom i have sent again thou therefore receive him that is mine own bowels
whom i would have retained with me that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel
but without thy mind would i do nothing that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity but willingly
for perhaps he therefore departed for a season that thou shouldest receive him for ever
not now as a servant but above a servant a brother beloved specially to me but how much more unto thee both in the flesh and in the lord
if thou count me therefore a partner receive him as myself
if he hath wronged thee or oweth thee ought put that on mine account
i paul have written it with mine own hand i will repay it albeit i do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides
yea brother let me have joy of thee in the lord refresh my bowels in the lord
having confidence in thy obedience i wrote unto thee knowing that thou wilt also do more than i say
but withal prepare me also a lodging for i trust that through your prayers i shall be given unto you
there salute thee epaphras my fellowprisoner in christ jesus
marcus aristarchus demas lucas my fellowlabourers
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with your spirit amen
the great sages approached manu who was seated with a collected mind and having duly worshipped him spoke as follows
deign divine one to declare to us precisely and in due order the sacred laws of each of the four chief castes varna and of the intermediate ones
tor thou o lord alone knowest the purport ie the rites and the knowledge of the soul taught in this whole ordinance of the selfexistent svayambhu which is unknowable and unfathomable
he whose power is measureless being thus asked by the highminded great sages duly honoured them and answered listen
this universe existed in the shape of darkness unperceived destitute of distinctive marks unattainable by reasoning unknowable wholly immersed as it were in deep sleep
then the divine selfexistent svayambhu himself indiscernible but making all this the great elements and the rest discernible appeared with irresistible creative power dispelling the darkness
he who can be perceived by the internal organ alone who is subtile indiscernible and eternal who contains all created beings and is inconceivable shone forth of his own will
he desiring to produce beings of many kinds from his own body first with a thought created the waters and placed his seed in them
that seed became a golden egg in brilliancy equal to the sun in that egg he himself was born as brahman the progenitor of the whole world
the waters are called narah for the waters are indeed the offspring of nara as they were his first residence ayana he thence is named narayana
from that first cause which is indiscernible eternal and both real and unreal was produced that male purusha who is famed in this world under the appellation of brahman
the divine one resided in that egg during a whole year then he himself by his thought alone divided it into two halves
and out of those two halves he formed heaven and earth between them the middle sphere the eight points of the horizon and the eternal abode of the waters
from himself atmanah he also drew forth the mind which is both real and unreal likewise from the mind egoism which possesses the function of selfconsciousness and is lordly
moreover the great one the soul and all products affected by the three qualities and in their order the five organs which perceive the objects of sensation
but joining minute particles even of those six which possess measureless power with particles of himself he created all beings
because those six kinds of minute particles which form the creators frame enter asri these creatures therefore the wise call his frame sarira the body
that the great elements enter together with their functions and the mind through its minute parts the framer of all beings the imperishable one
but from minute body framing particles of these seven very powerful purushas springs this world the perishable from the imperishable
among them each succeeding element acquires the quality of the preceding one and whatever place in the sequence each of them occupies even so many qualities it is declared to possess
but in the beginning he assigned their several names actions and conditions to all created beings even according to the words of the veda
he the lord also created the class of the gods who are endowed with life and whose nature is action and the subtile class of the sadhyas and the eternal sacrifice
but from fire wind and the sun he drew forth the threefold eternal veda called rik yagus and saman for the due performance of the sacrifice
time and the divisions of time the lunar mansions and the planets the rivers the oceans the mountains plains and uneven ground
austerity speech pleasure desire and anger this whole creation he likewise produced as he desired to call these beings into existence
moreover in order to distinguish actions he separated merit from demerit and he caused the creatures to be affected by the pairs of opposites such as pain and pleasure
but with the minute perishable particles of the five elements which have been mentioned this whole world is framed in due order
but to whatever course of action the lord at first appointed each kind of beings that alone it has spontaneously adopted in each succeeding creation
whatever he assigned to each at the first creation noxiousness or harmlessness gentleness or ferocity virtue or sin truth or falsehood that clung afterwards spontaneously to it
as at the change of the seasons each season of its own accord assumes its distinctive marks even so corporeal beings resume in new births their appointed course of action
but for the sake of the prosperity of the worlds he caused the brahmana the kshatriya the vaisya and the sudra to proceed from his mouth his arms his thighs and his feet
dividing his own body the lord became half male and half female with that female he produced virag
but know me o most holy among the twiceborn to be the creator of this whole world whom that male virag himself produced having performed austerities
then i desiring to produce created beings performed very difficult austerities and thereby called into existence ten great sages lords of created beings
mariki atri angiras pulastya pulaha kratu praketas vasishtha bhrigu and narada
they created seven other manus possessing great brilliancy gods and classes of gods and great sages of measureless power
yakshas the servants of kubera the demons called rakshasas and pisakas gandharvas or musicians of the gods apsarases the dancers of the gods asuras the snakedeities called nagas and sarpas the bird deities called supamas and the several classes of the manes
lightnings thunderbolts and clouds imperfect rohita and perfect rainbows falling meteors supernatural noises comets and heavenly lights of many kinds
horsefaced kinnaras monkeys fishes birds of many kinds cattle deer men and carnivorous beasts with two rows of teeth
small and large worms and beetles moths lice flies bugs all stinging and biting insects and the several kinds of immovable things
thus was this whole creation both the immovable and the movable produced by those highminded ones by means of austerities and at my command each being according to the results of its actions
but whatever act is stated to belong to each of those creatures here below that i will truly declare to you as well as their order in respect to birth
cattle deer carnivorous beasts with two rows of teeth rakshasas pisakas and men are bom from the womb
from eggs are born birds snakes crocodiles fishes tortoises as well as similar terrestrial and aquatic animals
from hot moisture spring stinging and biting insects lice flies bugs and all other creatures of that kind which are produced by heat
all plants propagated by seed or by slips grow from shoots annual plants are those which bearing many flowers and fruits perish after the ripening of their fruit
those trees which bear fmit without flowers are called vanaspati lords of the forest but those which bear both flowers and fruit are called vriksha
but the various plants with many stalks growing from one or several roots the different kinds of grasses the climbing plants and the creepers spring all from seed or from slips
these plants which are surrounded by multiform darkness the result of their acts in former existences possess internal consciousness and experience pleasure and pain
the various conditions in this always terrible and constantly changing circle of births and deaths to which created beings are subject are stated to begin with that of brahman and to end with that of these just mentioned immovable creatures
when he whose power is incomprehensible had thus produced the universe and men he disappeared in himself repeatedly suppressing one period by means of the other
when that divine one wakes then this world stirs when he slumbers tranquilly then the universe sinks to sleep
but when he reposes in calm sleep the corporeal beings whose nature is action desist from their actions and mind becomes inert
when they are absorbed all at once in that great soul then he who is the soul of all beings sweetly slumbers free from all care and occupation
when this soul has entered darkness it remains for a long time united with the organs of sensation but performs not its functions it then leaves the corporeal frame
when being clothed with minute particles only it enters into vegetable or animal seed it then assumes united with the fine body a new corporeal frame
thus he the imperishable one by alternately waking and slumbering incessantly revivifies and destroys this whole movable and immovable creation
but he having composed these institutes of the sacred law himself taught them according to the rule to me alone in the beginning next i taught them to mariki and the other sages
bhrigu here will fully recite to you these institutes for that sage learned the whole in its entirety from me
then that great sage bhrigu being thus addressed by manu spoke pleased in his heart to all the sages listen
six other highminded very powerful manus who belong to the race of this manu the descendant of the selfexistent svayambhu and who have severally produced created beings
are svarokisha auttami tamasa raivata kakshusha possessing great lustre and the son of vivasvat
these seven very glorious manus the first among whom is svayambhuva produced and protected this whole movable and immovable creation each during the period allotted to him
eighteen nimeshas twinklings of the eye are one kashtha thirty kashthas one kala thirty kalas one muhurta and as many muhurtas one day and night
the sun divides days and nights both human and divine the night being intended for the repose of created beings and the day for exertion
a month is a day and a night of the manes but the division is according to fortnights the dark fortnight is their day for active exertion the bright fortnight their night for sleep
a year is a day and a night of the gods their division is as follows the half year during which the sun progresses to the north will be the day that during which it goes southwards the night
but hear now the brief description of the duration of a night and a day of brahman and of the several ages of the world yuga according to their order
they declare that the krita age consists of four thousand years of the gods the twilight preceding it consists of as many hundreds and the twilight following it of the same number
in the other three ages with their twilights preceding and following the thousands and hundreds are diminished by one in each
these twelve thousand years which thus have been just mentioned as the total of four human ages are called one age of the gods
but know that the sum of one thousand ages of the gods makes one day of brahman and that his night has the same length
those only who know that the holy day of brahman indeed ends after the completion of one thousand ages of the gods and that his night lasts as long are really men acquainted with the length of days and nights
at the end of that day and night he who was asleep awakes and after awaking creates mind which is both real and unreal
mind impelled by brahmans desire to create performs the work of creation by modifying itself thence ether is produced they declare that sound is the quality of the latter
but from ether modifying itself springs the pure powerful wind the vehicle of all perfumes that is held to possess the quality of touch
next from wind modifying itself proceeds the brilliant light which illuminates and dispels darkness that is declared to possess the quality of colour
and from light modifying itself is produced water possessing the quality of taste from water earth which has the quality of smell such is the creation in the beginning
the beforementioned age of the gods or twelve thousand of their years being multiplied by seventy one constitutes what is here named the period of a manu manvantara
the manvantaras the creations and destructions of the world are numberless sporting as it were brahman repeats this again and again
in the krita age dharma is fourfooted and entire and so is truth nor does any gain accrue to men by unrighteousness
in the other three ages by reason of unjust gains agama dharma is deprived successively of one foot and through the prevalence of theft falsehood and fraud the merit gained by men is diminished by one fourth in each
men are free from disease accomplish all their aims and live four hundred years in the krita age but in the treta and in each of the succeeding ages their life is lessened by one quarter
the life of mortals mentioned in the veda the desired results of sacrificial rites and the supernatural power of embodied spirits are fruits proportioned among men according to the character of the age
one set of duties is prescribed for men in the krita age different ones in the treta and in the dvapara and again another set in the kali in a proportion as those ages decrease in length
in the krita age the chief virtue is declared to be the performance of austerities in the treta divine knowledge in the dvapara the performance of sacrifices in the kali liberality alone
but in order to protect this universe he the most resplendent one assigned separate duties and occupations to those who sprang from his mouth arms thighs and feet
to brahmanas he assigned teaching and studying the veda sacrificing for their own benefit and for others giving and accepting of alms
the kshatriya he commanded to protect the people to bestow gifts to offer sacrifices to study the veda and to abstain from attaching himself to sensual pleasures
the vaisya to tend cattle to bestow gifts to offer sacrifices to study the veda to trade to lend money and to cultivate land
one occupation only the lord prescribed to the sudra to serve meekly even these other three castes
man is stated to be purer above the navel than below hence the selfexistent svayambhu has declared the purest part of him to be his mouth
as the brahmana sprang from brahmans mouth as he was the firstborn and as he possesses the veda he is by right the lord of this whole creation
for the selfexistent svayambhu having performed austerities produced him first from his own mouth in order that the offerings might be conveyed to the gods and manes and that this universe might be preserved
what created being can surpass him through whose mouth the gods continually consume the sacrificial viands and the manes the offerings to the dead
of created beings the most excellent are said to be those which are animated of the animated those which subsist by intelligence of the intelligent mankind and of men the brahmanas
of brahmanas those learned in the veda of the learned those who recognise the necessity and the manner of performing the prescribed duties of those who possess this knowledge those who perform them of the performers those who know the brahman
the very birth of a brahmana is an eternal incarnation of the sacred law for he is bom to fulfil the sacred law and becomes one with brahman
a brahmana coming into existence is bom as the highest on earth the lord of all created beings for the protection of the treasury of the law
whatever exists in the world is the property of the brahmana on account of the excellence of his origin the brahmana is indeed entitled to all
the brahmana eats but his own food wears but his own apparel bestows but his own in alms other mortals subsist through the benevolence of the brahmana
in order to clearly settle his duties those of the other castes according to their order wise manu sprung from the selfexistent composed these institutes of the sacred law
a learned brahmana must carefully study them and he must duly instruct his pupils in them but nobody else shall do it
a brahmana who studies these institutes and faithfully fulfils the duties prescribed therein is never tainted by sins arising from thoughts words or deeds
he sanctifies any company which he may enter seven ancestors and seven descendants and he alone deserves to possess this whole earth
to study this work is the best means of securing welfare it increases understanding it procures fame and long life it leads to supreme bliss
in this work the sacred law has been fully stated as well as the good and bad qualities of human actions and the immemorial rule of conduct to be followed by all the four castes vama
the rule of conduct is transcendent law whether it be taught in the revealed texts or in the sacred tradition hence a twiceborn man who possesses regard for himself should be always careful to follow it
a brahmana who departs from the rule of conduct does not reap the fruit of the veda but he who duly follows it will obtain the full reward
the sages who saw that the sacred law is thus grounded on the rule of conduct have taken good conduct to be the most excellent root of all austerity
the creation of the universe the rule of the sacraments the ordinances of studentship and the respectful behaviour towards gurus the most excellent rule of bathing on return from the teachers house
the law of marriage and the description of the various marriagerites the regulations for the great sacrifices and the eternal rule of the funeral sacrifices
the description of the modes of gaining subsistence and the duties of a snataka the rules regarding lawful and forbidden food the purification of men and of things
the laws concerning women the law of hermits the manner of gaining final emancipation and of renouncing the world the whole duty of a king and the manner of deciding lawsuits
the rules for the examination of witnesses the laws concerning husband and wife the law of inheritance and division the law concerning gambling and the removal of men nocuous like thorns
the law concerning the behaviour of vaisyas and sudras the origin of the mixed castes the law for all castes in times of distress and the law of penances
the threefold course of transmigrations the result of good or bad actions the manner of attaining supreme bliss and the examination of the good and bad qualities of actions
the primeval laws of countries of castes gati of families and the rules concerning heretics and companies of traders and the like all that manu has declared in these institutes
as manu in reply to my questions formerly promulgated these institutes even so learn ye also the whole work from me
learn that sacred law which is followed by men learned in the veda and assented to in their hearts by the virtuous who are ever exempt from hatred and inordinate affection
to act solely from a desire for rewards is not laudable yet an exemption from that desire is not to be found in this world for on that desire is grounded the study of the veda and the performance of the actions prescribed by the veda
the desire for rewards indeed has its root in the conception that an act can yield them and in consequence of that conception sacrifices are performed vows and the laws prescribing restraints are all stated to be kept through the idea that they will bear fruit
not a single act here below appears ever to be done by a man free from desire for whatever man does it is the result of the impulse of desire
he who persists in discharging these prescribed duties in the right manner reaches the deathless state and even in this life obtains the fulfilment of all the desires that he may have conceived
the whole veda is the first source of the sacred law next the tradition and the virtuous conduct of those who know the veda further also the customs of holy men and finally selfsatisfaction
whatever law has been ordained for any person by manu that has been fully declared in the veda for that sage was omniscient
but a learned man after fully scrutinising all this with the eye of knowledge should in accordance with the authority of the revealed texts be intent on the performance of his duties
for that man who obeys the law prescribed in the revealed texts and in the sacred tradition gains fame in this world and after death unsurpassable bliss
but by sruti revelation is meant the veda and by smriti tradition the institutes of the sacred law those two must not be called into question in any matter since from those two the sacred law shone forth
every twicebom man who relying on the institutes of dialectics treats with contempt those two sources of the law must be cast out by the virtuous as an atheist and a scorner of the veda
the veda the sacred tradition the customs of virtuous men and ones own pleasure they declare to be visibly the fourfold means of defining the sacred law
the knowledge of the sacred law is prescribed for those who are not given to the acquisition of wealth and to the gratification of their desires to those who seek the knowledge of the sacred law the supreme authority is the revelation sruti
but when two sacred texts sruti are conflicting both are held to be law for both are pronounced by the wise to be valid law
thus the agnihotra sacrifice may be optionally performed at any time after the sun has risen before he has risen or when neither sun nor stars are visible that is declared by vedic texts
know that he for whom the performance of the ceremonies beginning with the rite of impregnation garbhadhana and ending with the funeral rite antyeshti is prescribed while sacred formulas are being recited is entitled to study these institutes but no other man whatsoever
that land created by the gods which lies between the two divine rivers sarasvati and drishadvati the sages call brahmavarta
the custom handed down in regular succession since time immemorial among the four chief castes varna and the mixed races of that country is called the conduct of virtuous men
the plain of the kurus the country of the matsyas pankalas and surasenakas these form indeed the country of the brahmarshis brahmanical sages which ranks immediately after brahmavarta
from a brahmana born in that country let all men on earth leam their several usages
that country which lies between the himavat and the vindhya mountains to the east of prayaga and to the west of vinasana the place where the river sarasvati disappears is called madhyadesa the central region
but the tract between those two mountains just mentioned which extends as far as the eastern and the western oceans the wise call aryavarta the country of the aryans
that land where the black antelope naturally roams one must know to be fit for the performance of sacrifices the tract different from that is the country of the mlekkhas barbarians
let twicebom men seek to dwell in those abovementioned countries but a sudra distressed for subsistence may reside anywhere
thus has the origin of the sacred law been succinctly described to you and the origin of this universe leam now the duties of the castes vama
with holy rites prescribed by the veda must the ceremony on conception and other sacraments be performed for twicebom men which sanctify the body and purify from sin in this life and after death
by burnt oblations during the mothers pregnancy by the gatakarman the ceremony after birth the kauda tonsure and the maungibandhana the tying of the sacred girdle of munga grass is the taint derived from both parents removed from twicebom men
by the study of the veda by vows by burnt oblations by the recitation of sacred texts by the acquisition of the threefold sacred science by offering to the gods rishis and manes by the procreation of sons by the great sacrifices and by srauta rites this human body is made fit for union with brahman
before the navelstring is cut the gatakarman birthrite must be performed for a male child and while sacred formulas are being recited he must be fed with gold honey and butter
but let the father perform or cause to be performed the namadheya the rite of naming the child on the tenth or twelfth day after birth or on a lucky lunar day in a lucky muhurta under an auspicious constellation
let the first part of a brahmanas name denote something auspicious a kshatriyas be connected with power and a vaisyas with wealth but a sudras express something contemptible
the second part of a brahmanas name shall be a word implying happiness of a kshatriyas a word implying protection of a vaisyas a term expressive of thriving and of a sudras an expression denoting service
the names of women should be easy to pronounce not imply anything dreadful possess a plain meaning be pleasing and auspicious end in long vowels and contain a word of benediction
in the fourth month the nishkramana the first leaving of the house of the child should be performed in the sixth month the annaprasana first feeding with rice and optionally any other auspicious ceremony required by the custom of the family
according to the teaching of the revealed texts the kudakarman tonsure must be performed for the sake of spiritual merit by all twiceborn men in the first or third year
in the eighth year after conception one should perform the initiation upanayana of a brahmana in the eleventh after conception that of a kshatriya but in the twelfth that of a vaisya
the initiation of a brahmana who desires proficiency in sacred learning should take place in the fifth year after conception that of a kshatriya who wishes to become powerful in the sixth and that of a vaisya who longs for success in his business in the eighth
the time for the savitri initiation of a brahmana does not pass until the completion of the sixteenth year after conception of a kshatriya until the completion of the twenty second and of a vaisya until the completion of the twentyfourth
after those periods men of these three castes who have not received the sacrament at the proper time become vratyas outcasts excluded from the savitri initiation and despised by the aryans
with such men if they have not been purified according to the rule let no brahmana ever even in times of distress form a connexion either through the veda or by marriage
let students according to the order of their castes wear as upper dresses the skins of black antelopes spotted deer and hegoats and lower garments made of hemp flax or wool
the girdle of a brahmana shall consist of a of a triple cord of munga grass smooth and soft that of a kshatriya of a bowstring made of murva fibres that of a vaisya of hempen threads
if munga grass and so forth be not procurable the girdles may be made of kusa asmantaka and balbaga fibres with a single threefold knot or with three or five knots according to the custom of the family
the sacrificial string of a brahmana shall be made of cotton shall be twisted to the right and consist of three threads that of a kshatriya of hempen threads and that of a vaisya of woollen threads
a brahmana shall carry according to the sacred law a staff of bilva or palasa a kshatriya of vata or khadira and a vaisya of pilu or udumbara
the staff of a brahmana shall be made of such length as to reach the end of his hair that of a kshatriya to reach his forehead and that of a vaisya to reach the tip of his nose
let all the staves be straight without a blemish handsome to look at not likely to terrify men with their bark perfect unhurt by fire
having taken a staff according to his choice having worshipped the sun and walked round the fire turning his right hand towards it the student should beg alms according to the prescribed rule
an initiated brahmana should beg beginning his request with the word lady bhavati a kshatriya placing the word lady in the middle but a vaisya placing it at the end of the formula
let him first beg food of his mother or of his sister or of his own maternal aunt or of some other female who will not disgrace him by a refusal
having collected as much food as is required from several persons and having announced it without guile to his teacher let him eat turning his face towards the east and having purified himself by sipping water
his meal will procure long life if he eats facing the east fame if he turns to the south prosperity if he turns to the west truthfulness if he faces the east
let a twicebom man always eat his food with concentrated mind after performing an ablution and after he has eaten let him duly cleanse himself with water and sprinkle the cavities of his head
let him always worship his food and eat it without contempt when he sees it let him rejoice show a pleased face and pray that he may always obtain it
food that is always worshipped gives strength and manly vigour but eaten irreverently it destroys them both
let him not give to any man what he leaves and beware of eating between the two mealtimes let him not overeat himself nor go anywhere without having purified himself after his meal
excessive eating is prejudicial to health to fame and to bliss in heaven it prevents the acquisition of spiritual merit and is odious among men one ought for these reasons to avoid it carefully
let a brahmana always sip water out of the part of the hand tirtha sacred to brahman or out of that sacred to ka pragapati or out of that sacred to the gods never out of that sacred to the manes
they call the part at the root of the thumb the tirtha sacred to brahman that at the root of the little finger the tirtha sacred to ka pragapati that at the tips of the fingers the tirtha sacred to the gods and that below between the index and the thumb the tirtha sacred to the manes
let him first sip water thrice next twice wipe his mouth and lastly touch with water the cavities of the head the seat of the soul and the head
he who knows the sacred law and seeks purity shall always perform the rite of sipping with water neither hot nor frothy with the prescribed tirtha in a lonely place and turning to the east or to the north
a brahmana is purified by water that reaches his heart a kshatriya by water reaching his throat a vaisya by water taken into his mouth and a sudra by water touched with the extremity of his lips
a twiceborn man is called upavitin when his right arm is raised and the sacrificial string or the dress passed under it rests on the left shoulder when his left arm is raised and the string or the dress passed under it rests on the right shoulder he is called prakinavitin and nivitin when it hangs down straight from the neck
his girdle the skin which serves as his upper garment his staff his sacrificial thread and his waterpot he must throw into water when they have been damaged and take others reciting sacred formulas
the ceremony called kesanta clipping the hair is ordained for a brahmana in the sixteenth year from conception for a kshatriya in the twenty second and for a vaisya two years later than that
this whole series of ceremonies must be performed for females also in order to sanctify the body at the proper time and in the proper order but without the recitation of sacred texts
the nuptial ceremony is stated to be the vedic sacrament for women and to be equal to the initiation serving the husband equivalent to the residence in the house of the teacher and the household duties the same as the daily worship of the sacred fire
thus has been described the rule for the initiation of the twicebom which indicates a new birth and sanctifies learn now to what duties they must afterwards apply themselves
having performed the rite of initiation the teacher must first instruct the pupil in the rules of personal purification of conduct of the fireworship and of the twilight devotions
but a student who is about to begin the study of the veda shall receive instruction after he has sipped water in accordance with the institutes of the sacred law has made the brahmangali has put on a clean dress and has brought his organs under due control
at the beginning and at the end of a lesson in the veda he must always clasp both the feet of his teacher and he must study joining his hands that is called the brahmangali joining the palms for the sake of the veda
with crossed hands he must clasp the feet of the teacher and touch the left foot with his left hand the right foot with his right hand
but to him who is about to begin studying the teacher always unwearied must say ho recite he shall leave off when the teacher says let a stoppage take place
let him always pronounce the syllable om at the beginning and at the end of a lesson in the veda for unless the syllable om precede the lesson will slip away from him and unless it follow it will fade away
seated on blades of kusa grass with their points to the east purified by pavitras blades of kusa grass and sanctified by three suppressions of the breath pranayama he is worthy to pronounce the syllable om
pragapati the lord of creatures milked out as it were from the three vedas the sounds a u and m and the vyahritis bhuh bhuvah svah
moreover from the three vedas pragapati who dwells in the highest heaven parameshthin milked out as it were that rikverse sacred to savitri savitri which begins with the word tad one foot from each
a brahmana learned in the veda who recites during both twilights that syllable and that verse preceded by the vyahritis gains the whole merit which the recitation of the vedas confers
a twiceborn man who daily repeats those three one thousand times outside the village will be freed after a month even from great guilt as a snake from its slough
the brahmana the kshatriya and the vaisya who neglect the recitation of that rikverse and the timely performance of the rites prescribed for them will be blamed among virtuous men
know that the three imperishable mahavyahritis preceded by the syllable om and followed by the threefooted savitri are the portal of the veda and the gate leading to union with brahman
he who daily recites that verse untired during three years will enter after death the highest brahman move as free as air and assume an ethereal form
the monosyllable om is the highest brahman three suppressions of the breath are the best form of austerity but nothing surpasses the savitri truthfulness is better than silence
all rites ordained in the veda burnt oblations and other sacrifices pass away but know that the syllable om is imperishable and it is brahman and the lord of creatures pragapati
an offering consisting of muttered prayers is ten times more efficacious than a sacrifice performed according to the rules of the veda a prayer which is inaudible to others surpasses it a hundred times and the mental recitation of sacred texts a thousand times
the four pakayagnas and those sacrifices which are enjoined by the rules of the veda are all together not equal in value to a sixteenth part of the sacrifice consisting of muttered prayers
but undoubtedly a brahmana reaches the highest goal by muttering prayers only whether he perform other rites or neglect them he who befriends all creatures is declared to be a true brahmana
a wise man should strive to restrain his organs which run wild among alluring sensual objects like a charioteer his horses
those eleven organs which former sages have named i will properly and precisely enumerate in due order
viz the ear the skin the eyes the tongue and the nose as the fifth the anus the organ of generation hands and feet and the organ of speech named as the tenth
five of them the ear and the rest according to their order they call organs of sense and five of them the anus and the rest organs of action
know that the internal organ manas is the eleventh which by its quality belongs to both sets when that has been subdued both those sets of five have been conquered
through the attachment of his organs to sensual pleasure a man doubtlessly will incur guilt but if he keep them under complete control he will obtain success in gaining all his aims
desire is never extinguished by the enjoyment of desired objects it only grows stronger like a fire fed with clarified butter
if one man should obtain all those sensual enjoyments and another should renounce them all the renunciation of all pleasure is far better than the attainment of them
those organs which are strongly attached to sensual pleasures cannot so effectually be restrained by abstinence from enjoyments as by a constant pursuit of true knowledge
neither the study of the vedas nor liberality nor sacrifices nor any selfimposed restraint nor austerities ever procure the attainment of rewards to a man whose heart is contaminated by sensuality
that man may be considered to have really subdued his organs who on hearing and touching and seeing on tasting and smelling anything neither rejoices nor repines
but when one among all the organs slips away from control thereby mans wisdom slips away from him even as the water flows through the one open foot of a watercarriers skin
if he keeps all the ten organs as well as the mind in subjection he may gain all his aims without reducing his body by the practice of yoga
let him stand during the morning twilight muttering the savitri until the sun appears but let him recite it seated in the evening until the constellations can be seen distinctly
he who stands during the morning twilight muttering the savitri removes the guilt contracted during the previous night but he who recites it seated in the evening destroys the sin he committed during the day
but he who does not worship standing in the morning nor sitting in the evening shall be excluded just like a sudra from all the duties and rights of an aryan
he who desires to perform the ceremony of the daily recitation may even recite the savitri near water retiring into the forest controlling his organs and concentrating his mind
both when one studies the supplementary treatises of the veda and when one recites the daily portion of the veda no regard need be paid to forbidden days likewise when one repeats the sacred texts required for a burnt oblation
there are no forbidden days for the daily recitation since that is declared to be a brahmasattra an everlasting sacrifice offered to brahman at that the veda takes the place of the burnt oblations and it is meritorious even when natural phenomena requiring a cessation of the vedastudy take the place of the exclamation vashat
for him who being pure and controlling his organs during a year daily recites the veda according to the rule that daily recitation will ever cause sweet and sour milk clarified butter and honey to flow
let an aryan who has been initiated daily offer fuel in the sacred fire beg food sleep on the ground and do what is beneficial to this teacher until he performs the ceremony of samavartana on returning home
according to the sacred law the following ten persons viz the teachers son one who desires to do service one who imparts knowledge one who is intent on fulfilling the law one who is pure a person connected by marriage or friendship one who possesses mental ability one who makes presents of money one who is honest and a relative may be instructed in the veda
unless one be asked one must not explain anything to anybody nor must one answer a person who asks improperly let a wise man though he knows the answer behave among men as if he were an idiot
of the two persons him who illegally explains anything and him who illegally asks a question one or both will die or incur the others enmity
where merit and wealth are not obtained by teaching nor at least due obedience in such soil sacred knowledge must not be sown just as good seed must not be thrown on barren land
even in times of dire distress a teacher of the veda should rather die with his knowledge than sow it in barren soil
sacred learning approached a brahmana and said to him i am thy treasure preserve me deliver me not to a scorner so preserved i shall become supremely strong
but deliver me as to the keeper of thy treasure to a brahmana whom thou shalt know to be pure of subdued senses chaste and attentive
but he who acquires without permission the veda from one who recites it incurs the guilt of stealing the veda and shall sink into hell
a student shall first reverentially salute that teacher from whom he receives knowledge referring to worldly affairs to the veda or to the brahman
a brahmana who completely governs himself though he know the savitri only is better than he who knows the three vedas but does not control himself eats all sorts of food and sells all sorts of goods
one must not sit down on a couch or seat which a superior occupies and he who occupies a couch or seat shall rise to meet a superior and afterwards salute him
for the vital airs of a young man mount upwards to leave his body when an elder approaches but by rising to meet him and saluting he recovers them
he who habitually salutes and constantly pays reverence to the aged obtains an increase of four things viz length of life knowledge fame and strength
after the word of salutation a brahmana who greets an elder must pronounce his name saying i am n n
to those persons who when a name is pronounced do not understand the meaning of the salutation a wise man should say it is i and he should address in the same manner all women
in saluting he should pronounce after his name the word bhoh for the sages have declared that the nature of bhoh is the same as that of all proper names
a brahmana should thus be saluted in return mayst thou be longlived o gentle one and the vowel a must be added at the end of the name of the person addressed the syllable preceding it being drawn out to the length of three moras
a brahmana who does not know the form of returning a salutation must not be saluted by a learned man as a sudra even so is he
let him ask a brahmana on meeting him after his health with the word kusala a kshatriya with the word anamaya a vaisya with the word kshema and a sudra with the word anarogya
he who has been initiated to perform a srauta sacrifice must not be addressed by his name even though he be a younger man he who knows the sacred law must use in speaking to such a man the particle bhoh and the pronoun bhavat your worship
but to a female who is the wife of another man and not a bloodrelation he must say lady bhavati or beloved sister
to his maternal and paternal uncles fathersinlaw officiating priests and other venerable persons he must say am n n and rise to meet them even though they be younger than himself
a maternal aunt the wife of a maternal uncle a motherinlaw and a paternal aunt must be honoured like the wife of ones teacher they are equal to the wife of ones teacher
the feet of the wife of ones brother if she be of the same caste vama must be clasped every day but the feet of wives of other paternal and maternal relatives need only be embraced on ones return from a journey
towards a sister of ones father and of ones mother and towards ones own elder sister one must behave as towards ones mother but the mother is more venerable than they
fellowcitizens are called friends and equals though one be ten years older than the other men practising the same fine art though one be five years older than the other srotriyas though three years intervene between their ages but bloodrelations only if the difference of age be very small
know that a brahmana of ten years and kshatriya of a hundred years stand to each other in the relation of father and son but between those two the brahmana is the father
wealth kindred age the due performance of rites and fifthly sacred learning are titles to respect but each laternamed cause is more weighty than the preceding ones
whatever man of the three highest castes possesses most of those five both in number and degree that man is worthy of honour among them and so is also a sudra who has entered the tenth decade of his life
way must be made for a man in a carriage for one who is above ninety years old for one diseased for the carrier of a burden for a woman for a snataka for the king and for a bridegroom
among all those if they meet at one time a snataka and the king must be most honoured and if the king and a snataka meet the latter receives respect from the king
they call that brahmana who initiates a pupil and teaches him the veda together with the kalpa and the rahasyas the teacher akarya of the latter
but he who for his livelihood teaches a portion only of the veda or also the angas of the veda is called the subteacher upadhyaya
that brahmana who performs in accordance with the rules of the veda the rites the garbhadhana conceptionrite and so forth and gives food to the child is called the guru the venerable one
he who being duly chosen for the purpose performs the agnyadheya the pakayagnas and the srauta sacrifices such as the agnishtoma for another man is called his officiating priest
that man who truthfully fills both his ears with the veda the pupil shall consider as his father and mother he must never offend him
the teacher akarya is ten times more venerable than a subteacher upadhyaya the father a hundred times more than the teacher but the mother a thousand times more than the father
of him who gives natural birth and him who gives the knowledge of the veda the giver of the veda is the more venerable father for the birth for the sake of the veda ensures eternal rewards both in this life and after death
let him consider that he received a mere animal existence when his parents begat him through mutual affection and when he was born from the womb of his mother
but that birth which a teacher acquainted with the whole veda in accordance with the law procures for him through the savitri is real exempt from age and death
the pupil must know that that man also who benefits him by instruction in the veda be it little or much is called in these institutes his guru in consequence of that benefit conferred by instruction in the veda
that brahmana who is the giver of the birth for the sake of the veda and the teacher of the prescribed duties becomes by law the father of an aged man even though he himself be a child
young kavi the son of angiras taught his relatives who were old enough to be fathers and as he excelled them in sacred knowledge he called them little sons
they moved with resentment asked the gods concerning that matter and the gods having assembled answered the child has addressed you properly
tor a man destitute of sacred knowledge is indeed a child and he who teaches him the veda is his father for the sages have always said child to an ignorant man and father to a teacher of the veda
neither through years nor through white hairs nor through wealth nor through powerful kinsmen comes greatness the sages have made this law he who has learnt the veda together with the angas anukana is considered great by us
the seniority of brahmanas is from sacred knowledge that of kshatriyas from valour that of vaisyas from wealth in grain and other goods but that of sudras alone from age
a man is not therefore considered venerable because his head is gray him who though young has learned the veda the gods consider to be venerable
as an elephant made of wood as an antelope made of leather such is an unlearned brahmana those three have nothing but the names of their kind
as a eunuch is unproductive with women as a cow with a cow is unprolific and as a gift made to an ignorant man yields no reward even so is a brahmana useless who does not know the rikas
created beings must be instructed in what concerns their welfare without giving them pain and sweet and gentle speech must be used by a teacher who desires to abide by the sacred law
he forsooth whose speech and thoughts are pure and ever perfectly guarded gains the whole reward which is conferred by the vedanta
let him not even though in pain speak words cutting others to the quick let him not injure others in thought or deed let him not utter speeches which make others afraid of him since that will prevent him from gaining heaven
a brahmana should always fear homage as if it were poison and constantly desire to suffer scorn as he would long for nectar
for he who is scorned nevertheless may sleep with an easy mind awake with an easy mind and with an easy mind walk here among men but the scomer utterly perishes
a twiceborn man who has been sanctified by the employment of the means described above in due order shall gradually and cumulatively perform the various austerities prescribed for those who study the veda
an aryan must study the whole veda together with the rahasyas performing at the same time various kinds of austerities and the vows prescribed by the rules of the veda
let a brahmana who desires to perform austerities constantly repeat the veda for the study of the veda is declared to be in this world the highest austerity for a brahmana
verily that twiceborn man performs the highest austerity up to the extremities of his nails who though wearing a garland daily recites the veda in private to the utmost of his ability
a twiceborn man who not having studied the veda applies himself to other and worldly study soon falls even while living to the condition of a sudra and his descendants after him
according to the injunction of the revealed texts the first birth of an aryan is from his natural mother the second happens on the tying of the girdle of munga grass and the third on the initiation to the performance of a srauta sacrifice
among those three the birth which is symbolised by the investiture with the girdle of munga grass is his birth for the sake of the veda they declare that in that birth the sivitri verse is his mother and the teacher his father
they call the teacher the pupils father because he gives the veda for nobody can perform a sacred rite before the investiture with the girdle of munga grass
he who has not been initiated should not pronounce any vedic text excepting those required for the performance of funeral rites since he is on a level with a sudra before his birth from the veda
the student who has been initiated must be instructed in the performance of the vows and gradually learn the veda observing the prescribed rules
whatever dress of skin sacred thread girdle staff and lower garment are prescribed for a student at the initiation the like must again be used at the performance of the vows
but a student who resides with his teacher must observe the following restrictive rules duly controlling all his organs in order to increase his spiritual merit
every day having bathed and being purified he must offer libations of water to the gods sages and manes worship the images of the gods and place fuel on the sacred fire
let him abstain from honey meat perfumes garlands substances used for flavouring food women all substances turned acid and from doing injury to living creatures
from anointing his body applying collyrium to his eyes from the use of shoes and of an umbrella or parasol from sensual desire anger covetousness dancing singing and playing musical instruments
from gambling idle disputes backbiting and lying from looking at and touching women and from hurting others
let him always sleep alone let him never waste his manhood for he who voluntarily wastes his manhood breaks his vow
a twiceborn student who has involuntarily wasted his manly strength during sleep must bathe worship the sun and afterwards thrice mutter the rikverse which begins again let my strength return to me
let him fetch a pot full of water flowers cowdung earth and kusa grass as much as may be required by his teacher and daily go to beg food
a student being pure shall daily bring food from the houses of men who are not deficient in the knowledge of the veda and in performing sacrifices and who are famous for following their lawful occupations
let him not beg from the relatives of his teacher nor from his own or his mothers bloodrelations but if there are no houses belonging to strangers let him go to one of those named above taking the lastnamed first
or if there are no virtuous men of the kind mentioned above he may go to each house in the village being pure and remaining silent but let him avoid abhisastas those accused of mortal sin
having brought sacred fuel from a distance let him place it anywhere but on the ground and let him unwearied make with it burnt oblations to the sacred fire both evening and morning
he who without being sick neglects during seven successive days to go out begging and to offer fuel in the sacred fire shall perform the penance of an avakimin one who has broken his vow
he who performs the vow of studentship shall constantly subsist on alms but not eat the food of one person only the subsistence of a student on begged food is declared to be equal in merit to fasting
at his pleasure he may eat when invited the food of one man at a rite in honour of the gods observing however the conditions on his vow or at a funeral meal in honor of the manes behaving however like a hermit
this duty is prescribed by the wise for a brahmana only but no such duty is ordained for a kshatriya and a vaisya
both when ordered by his teacher and without a special command a student shall always exert himself in studying the veda and in doing what is serviceable to his teacher
controlling his body his speech his organs of sense and his mind let him stand with joined hands looking at the face of his teacher
let him always keep his right arm uncovered behave decently and keep his body well covered and when he is addressed with the words te seated he shall sit down facing his teacher
in the presence of his teacher let him always eat less wear a less valuable dress and ornaments than the former and let him rise earlier from his bed and go to rest later
let him not answer or converse with his teacher reclining on a bed nor sitting nor eating nor standing nor with an averted face
let him do that standing up if his teacher is seated advancing towards him when he stands going to meet him if he advances and running after him when he runs
going round to face the teacher if his face is averted approaching him if he stands at a distance but bending towards him if he lies on a bed and if he stands in a lower place
when his teacher is nigh let his bed or seat be low but within sight of his teacher he shall not sit carelessly at ease
let him not pronounce the mere name of his teacher without adding an honorific title behind his back even and let him not mimic his gait speech and deportment
wherever people justly censure or falsely defame his teacher there he must cover his ears or depart thence to another place
by censuring his teacher though justly he will become in his next birth an ass by falsely defaming him a dog he who lives on his teachers substance will become a worm and he who is envious of his merit a larger insect
he must not serve the teacher by the intervention of another while he himself stands aloof nor when he himself is angry nor when a woman is near if he is seated in a carriage or on a raised seat he must descend and afterwards salute his teacher
let him not sit with his teacher to the leeward or to the windward of him nor let him say anything which his teacher cannot hear
he may sit with his teacher in a carriage drawn by oxen horses or camels on a terrace on a bed of grass or leaves on a mat on a rock on a wooden bench or in a boat
if his teachers teacher is near let him behave towards him as towards his own teacher but let him unless he has received permission from his teacher not salute venerable persons of his own family
this is likewise ordained as his constant behaviour towards other instructors in science towards his relatives to whom honour is due towards all who may restrain him from sin or may give him salutary advice
towards his betters let him always behave as towards his teacher likewise towards sons of his teacher bom by wives of equal caste and towards the teachers relatives both on the side of the father and of the mother
the son of the teacher who imparts instruction in his fathers stead whether younger or of equal age or a student of the science of sacrifices or of other angas deserves the same honour as the teacher
a student must not shampoo the limbs of his teachers son nor assist him in bathing nor eat the fragments of his food nor wash his feet
the wives of the teacher who belong to the same caste must be treated as respectfully as the teacher but those who belong to a different caste must be honoured by rising and salutation
let him not perform for a wife of his teacher the offices of anointing her assisting her in the bath shampooing her limbs or arranging her hair
a pupil who is full twenty years old and knows what is becoming and unbecoming shall not salute a young wife of his teacher by clasping her feet
it is the nature of women to seduce men in this world for that reason the wise are never unguarded in the company of females
for women are able to lead astray in this world not only a fool but even a learned man and to make him a slave of desire and anger
one should not sit in a lonely place with ones mother sister or daughter for the senses are powerful and master even a learned man
but at his pleasure a young student may prostrate himself on the ground before the young wife of a teacher in accordance with the rule and say n n worship thee o lady
on returning from a journey he must clasp the feet of his teachers wife and daily salute her in the manner just mentioned remembering the duty of the virtuous
as the man who digs with a spade into the ground obtains water even so an obedient pupil obtains the knowledge which lies hidden in his teacher
a student may either shave his head or wear his hair in braids or braid one lock on the crown of his head the sun must never set or rise while he lies asleep in the village
if the sun should rise or set while he is sleeping be it that he offended intentionally or unintentionally he shall fast during the next day muttering the savitri
for he who lies sleeping while the sun sets or rises and does not perform that penance is tainted by great guilt
purified by sipping water he shall daily worship during both twilights with a concentrated mind in a pure place muttering the prescribed text according to the rule
if a woman or a man of low caste perform anything leading to happiness let him diligently practise it as well as any other permitted act in which his heart finds pleasure
some declare that the chief good consists in the acquisition of spiritual merit and wealth others place it in the gratification of desire and the acquisition of wealth others in the acquisition of spiritual merit alone and others say that the acquisition of wealth alone is the chief good here below but the correct decision is that it consists of the aggregate of those three
the teacher the father the mother and an elder brother must not be treated with disrespect especially by a brahmana though one be grievously offended by them
the teacher is the image of brahman the father the image of pragipati the lord of created beings the mother the image of the earth and an elder full brother the image of oneself
that trouble and pain which the parents undergo on the birth of their children cannot be compensated even in a hundred years
let him always do what is agreeable to those two and always what may please his teacher when those three are pleased he obtains all those rewards which austerities yield
obedience towards those three is declared to be the best form of austerity let him not perform other meritorious acts without their permission
for they are declared to be the three worlds they the three principal orders they the three vedas and they the three sacred fires
the father forsooth is stated to be the garhapatya fire the mother the dakshinagni but the teacher the ahavaniya fire this triad of fires is most venerable
he who neglects not those three even after he has become a householder will conquer the three worlds and radiant in body like a god he will enjoy bliss in heaven
by honouring his mother he gains this nether world by honouring his father the middle sphere but by obedience to his teacher the world of brahman
all duties have been fulfilled by him who honours those three but to him who honours them not all rites remain fruitless
as long as those three live so long let him not independently perform any other meritorious acts let him always serve them rejoicing to do what is agreeable and beneficial to them
he shall inform them of everything that with their consent he may perform in thought word or deed for the sake of the next world
by honouring these three all that ought to be done by man is accomplished that is clearly the highest duty every other act is a subordinate duty
he who possesses faith may receive pure learning even from a man of lower caste the highest law even from the lowest and an excellent wife even from a base family
even from poison nectar may be taken even from a child good advice even from a foe a lesson in good conduct and even from an impure substance gold
excellent wives learning the knowledge of the law the rules of purity good advice and various arts may be acquired from anybody
it is prescribed that in times of distress a student may leam the veda from one who is not a brahmana and that he shall walk behind and serve such a teacher as long as the instruction lasts
he who desires incomparable bliss in heaven shall not dwell during his whole life in the house of a nonbrahmanical teacher nor with a brahmana who does not know the whole veda and the angas
but if a student desires to pass his whole life in the teachers house he must diligently serve him until he is freed from this body
a brahmana who serves his teacher till the dissolution of his body reaches forthwith the eternal mansion of brahman
he who knows the sacred law must not present any gift to his teacher before the samavartana but when with the permission of his teacher he is about to take the final bath let him procure a present for the venerable man according to his ability
viz a field gold a cow a horse a parasol and shoes a seat grain even vegetables and thus give pleasure to his teacher
a perpetual student must if his teacher dies serve his son provided he be endowed with good qualities or his widow or his sapinda in the same manner as the teacher
should none of these be alive he must serve the sacred fire standing by day and sitting during the night and thus finish his life
a brahmana who thus passes his life as a student without breaking his vow reaches after death the highest abode and will not be bom again in this world
the vow of studying the three vedas under a teacher must be kept for thirtysix years or for half that time or for a quarter or until the student has perfectly leamt them
a student who has studied in due order the three vedas or two or even one only without breaking the rules of studentship shall enter the order of householders
he who is famous for the strict performance of his duties and has received his heritage the veda from his father shall be honoured sitting on a couch and adorned with a garland with the present of a cow and the honeymixture
having bathed with the permission of his teacher and performed according to the rule the samavartana the rite on returning home a twiceborn man shall marry a wife of equal caste who is endowed with auspicious bodily marks
a damsel who is neither a sapinda on the mothers side nor belongs to the same family on the fathers side is recommended to twicebom men for wedlock and conjugal union
in connecting himself with a wife let him carefully avoid the ten following families be they ever so great or rich in kine horses sheep grain or other property
viz one which neglects the sacred rites one in which no male children are born one in which the veda is not studied one the members of which have thick hair on the body those which are subject to hemorrhoids phthisis weakness of digestion epilepsy or white or black leprosy
let him not marry a maiden with reddish hair nor one who has a redundant member nor one who is sickly nor one either with no hair on the body or too much nor one who is garrulous or has red eyes
nor one named after a constellation a tree or a river nor one bearing the name of a low caste or of a mountain nor one named after a bird a snake or a slave nor one whose name inspires terror
let him wed a female free from bodily defects who has an agreeable name the graceful gait of a hamsa or of an elephant a moderate quantity of hair on the body and on the head small teeth and soft limbs
but a prudent man should not marry a maiden who has no brother nor one whose father is not known through fear lest in the former case she be made an appointed daughter and in the latter lest he should commit sin
for the first marriage of twicebom men wives of equal caste are recommended but for those who through desire proceed to marry again the following females chosen according to the direct order of the castes are most approved
it is declared that a sudra woman alone can be the wife of a sudra she and one of his own caste the wives of a vaisya those two and one of his own caste the wives of a kshatriya those three and one of his own caste the wives of a brahmana
a sudra woman is not mentioned even in any ancient story as the first wife of a brahmana or of a kshatriya though they lived in the greatest distress
twicebom men who in their folly wed wives of the low sudra caste soon degrade their families and their children to the state of sudras
according to atri and to gautama the son of utathya he who weds a sudra woman becomes an outcast according to saunaka on the birth of a son and according to bhrigu he who has male offspring from a sudra female alone
a brahmana who takes a sudra wife to his bed will after death sink into hell if he begets a child by her he will lose the rank of a brahmana
the manes and the gods will not eat the offerings of that man who performs the rites in honour of the gods of the manes and of guests chiefly with a sudra wifes assistance and such a man will not go to heaven
for him who drinks the moisture of a sudras lips who is tainted by her breath and who begets a son on her no expiation is prescribed
now listen to the brief description of the following eight marriage rites used by the four castes varna which partly secure benefits and partly produce evil both in this life and after death
they are the rite of brahman brahma that of the gods daiva that of the rishis arsha that of pragapati pragapatya that of the asuras asura that of the gandharvas gandharva that of the rhashasas rakshasa and that of the pisakas paisaka
which is lawful for each caste vama and which are the virtues or faults of each rite all this i will declare to you as well as their good and evil results with respect to the offspring
one may know that the first six according to the order followed above are lawful for a brahmana the four last for a kshatriya and the same four excepting the rakshasa rite for a vaisya and a sudra
the sages state that the first four are approved in the case of a brahmana one the rakshasa rite in the case of a kshatriya and the asura marriage in that of a vaisya and of a sudra
but in these institutes of the sacred law three of the five last are declared to be lawful and two unlawful the paisaka and the asura rites must never be used
for kshatriyas those beforementioned two rites the gandharva and the rakshasa whether separate or mixed are permitted by the sacred tradition
the gift of a daughter after decking her with costly garments and honouring her by presents of jewels to a man learned in the veda and of good conduct whom the father himself invites is called the brahma rite
the gift of a daughter who has been decked with ornaments to a priest who duly officiates at a sacrifice during the course of its performance they call the daiva rite
when the father gives away his daughter according to the rule after receiving from the bridegroom for the fulfilment of the sacred law a cow and a bull or two pairs that is named the arsha rite
the gift of a daughter by her father after he has addressed the couple with the text may both of you perform together your duties and has shown honour to the bridegroom is called in the smriti the pragapatya rite
when the bridegroom receives a maiden after having given as much wealth as he can afford to the kinsmen and to the bride herself according to his own will that is called the asura rite
the voluntary union of a maiden and her lover one must know to be the gandharva rite which springs from desire and has sexual intercourse for its purpose
the forcible abduction of a maiden from her home while she cries out and weeps after her kinsmen have been slain or wounded and their houses broken open is called the rakshasa rite
when a man by stealth seduces a girl who is sleeping intoxicated or disordered in intellect that is the eighth the most base and sinful rite of the pisakas
the gift of daughters among brahmanas is most approved if it is preceded by a libation of water but in the case of other castes it may be performed by the expression of mutual consent
listen now to me ye brahmanas while i fully declare what quality has been ascribed by manu to each of these marriagerites
the son of a wife wedded according to the brahma rite if he performs meritorious acts liberates from sin ten ancestors ten descendants and himself as the twentyfirst
the son born of a wife wedded according to the daiva rite likewise saves seven ancestors and seven descendants the son of a wife married by the arsha rite three in the ascending and descending lines and the son of a wife married by the rite of ka pragapati six in either line
from the four marriages enumerated successively which begin with the brahma rite spring sons radiant with knowledge of the veda and honoured by the sishtas good men
endowded with the qualities of beauty and goodness possessing wealth and fame obtaining as many enjoyments as they desire and being most righteous they will live a hundred years
but from the remaining four blamable marriages spring sons who are cruel and speakers of untruth who hate the veda and the sacred law
in the blameless marriages blameless children are born to men in blamable marriages blamable offspring one should therefore avoid the blamable forms of marriage
the ceremony of joining the hands is prescribed for marriages with women of equal caste varna know that the following rule applies to weddings with females of a different caste varna
on marrying a man of a higher caste a kshatriya bride must take hold of an arrow a vaisya bride of a goad and a sudra female of the hem of the bridegrooms garment
let the husband approach his wife in due season being constantly satisfied with her alone he may also being intent on pleasing her approach her with a desire for conjugal union on any day excepting the parvans
sixteen days and nights in each month including four days which differ from the rest and are censured by the virtuous are called the natural season of women
but among these the first four the eleventh and the thirteenth are declared to be forbidden the remaining nights are recommended
on the even nights sons are conceived and daughters on the uneven ones hence a man who desires to have sons should approach his wife in due season on the even nights
a male child is produced by a greater quantity of male seed a female child by the prevalence of the female if both are equal a hermaphrodite or a boy and a girl if both are weak or deficient in quantity a failure of conception results
he who avoids women on the six forbidden nights and on eight others is equal in chastity to a student in whichever order he may live
no father who knows the law must take even the smallest gratuity for his daughter for a man who through avarice takes a gratuity is a seller of his offspring
but those male relations who in their folly live on the separate property of women eg appropriate the beasts of burden carriages and clothes of women commit sin and will sink into hell
some call the cow and the bull given at an arsha wedding a gratuity but that is wrong since the acceptance of a fee be it small or great is a sale of the daughter
when the relatives do not appropriate for their use the gratuity given it is not a sale in that case the gift is only a token of respect and of kindness towards the maidens
women must be honoured and adorned by their fathers brothers husbands and brothersinlaw who desire their own welfare
where women are honoured there the gods are pleased but where they are not honoured no sacred rite yields rewards
where the female relations live in grief the family soon wholly perishes but that family where they are not unhappy ever prospers
the houses on which female relations not being duly honoured pronounce a curse perish completely as if destroyed by magic
hence men who seek their own welfare should always honour women on holidays and festivals with gifts of ornaments clothes and dainty food
in that family where the husband is pleased with his wife and the wife with her husband happiness will assuredly be lasting
for if the wife is not radiant with beauty she will not attract her husband but if she has no attractions for him no children will be born
if the wife is radiant with beauty the whole house is bright but if she is destitute of beauty all will appear dismal
by low marriages by omitting the performance of sacred rites by neglecting the study of the veda and by irreverence towards brahmanas great families sink low
by practising handicrafts by pecuniary transactions by begetting children on sudra females only by trading in cows horses and carriages by the pursuit of agriculture and by taking service under a king
by sacrificing for men unworthy to offer sacrifices and by denying the future rewards for good works families deficient in the knowledge of the veda quickly perish
but families that are rich in the knowledge of the veda though possessing little wealth are numbered among the great and acquire great fame
with the sacred fire kindled at the wedding a householder shall perform according to the law the domestic ceremonies and the five great sacrifices and with that he shall daily cook his food
a householder has five slaughterhouses as it were viz the hearth the grindingstone the broom the pestle and mortar the watervessel by using which he is bound with the fetters of sin
in order to successively expiate the offences committed by means of all these five the great sages have prescribed for householders the daily performance of the five great sacrifices
teaching and studying is the sacrifice offered to brahman the offerings of water and food called tarpana the sacrifice to the manes the burnt oblation the sacrifice offered to the gods the bali offering that offered to the bhutas and the hospitable reception of guests the offering to men
he who neglects not these five great sacrifices while he is able to perform them is not tainted by the sins committed in the five places of slaughter though he constantly lives in the order of house holders
but he who does not feed these five the gods his guests those whom he is bound to maintain the manes and himself lives not though he breathes
they call these five sacrifices also ahuta huta prahuta brahmyahuta and prasita
ahuta not offered in the fire is the muttering of vedic texts huta the burnt oblation offered to the gods prahuta offered by scattering it on the ground the bali offering given to the bhutas brahmyahuta offered in the digestive fire of brahmanas the respectful reception of brahmana guests and prasita eaten the daily oblation to the manes called tarpana
let every man in this second order at least daily apply himself to the private recitation of the veda and also to the performance of the offering to the gods for he who is diligent in the performance of sacrifices supports both the movable and the immovable creation
an oblation duly thrown into the fire reaches the sun from the sun comes rain from rain food therefrom the living creatures derive their subsistence
as all living creatures subsist by receiving support from air even so the members of all orders subsist by receiving support from the householder
because men of the three other orders are daily supported by the householder with gifts of sacred knowledge and food therefore the order of householders is the most excellent order
the duties of this order which cannot be practised by men with weak organs must be carefully observed by him who desires imperishable bliss in heaven and constant happiness in this life
the sages the manes the gods the bhutas and guests ask the householders for offerings and gifts hence he who knows the law must give to them what is due to each
let him worship according to the rule the sages by the private recitation of the veda the gods by burnt oblations the manes by funeral offerings sraddha men by gifts of food and the bhutas by the bali offering
let him daily perform a funeral sacrifice with food or with water or also with milk roots and fruits and thus please the manes
let him feed even one brahmana in honour of the manes at the sraddha which belongs to the five great sacrifices but let him not feed on that occasion any brahmana on account of the vaisvadeva offering
a brahmana shall offer according to the rule of his grihyasutra a portion of the cooked food destined for the vaisvadeva in the sacred domestic fire to the following deities
first to agni and next to soma then to both these gods conjointly further to all the gods visve devah and then to dhanvantari
further to kuhu the goddess of the newmoon day to anumati the goddess of the fullmoon day to pragapati the lord of creatures to heaven and earth conjointly and finally to agni svishtakrit the fire which performs the sacrifice well
after having thus duly offered the sacrificial food let him throw bali offerings in all directions of the compass proceeding from the east to the south to indra yama varuna and soma as well as to the servants of these deities
saying adoration to the marutshe shall scatter some food near the door and some in water saying adoration to the waters he shall throw some on the pestle and the mortar speaking thus adoration to the trees
near the head of the bed he shall make an offering to sri fortune and near the foot of his bed to bhadrakali in the centre of the house let him place a bali for brahman and for vastoshpati the lord of the dwelling conjointly
let him throw up into the air a bali for all the gods and in the daytime one for the goblins roaming about by day and in the evening one for the goblins that walk at night
in the upper story let him offer a bali to sarvatmabhuti but let him throw what remains from these offerings in a southerly direction for the manes
let him gently place on the ground some food for dogs outcasts kandalas svapak those afflicted with diseases that are punishments of former sins crows and insects
that brahmana who thus daily honours all beings goes endowed with a resplendent body by a straight road to the highest dwellingplace ie brahman
having performed this bali offering he shall first feed his guest and according to the rule give alms to an ascetic and to a student
a twiceborn householder gains by giving alms the same reward for his meritorious act which a student obtains for presenting in accordance with the rule a cow to his teacher
let him give in accordance with the rule to a brahmana who knows the true meaning of the veda even a small portion of food as alms or a pot full of water having garnished the food with seasoning or the pot with flowers and fruit
the oblations to gods and manes made by men ignorant of the law of gifts are lost if the givers in their folly present shares of them to brahmanas who are mere ashes
an offering made in the mouthfire of brahmanas rich in sacred learning and austerities saves from misfortune and from great guilt
but let him offer in accordance with the rule to a guest who has come of his own accord a seat and water as well as food garnished with seasoning according to his ability
a brahmana who stays unhonoured in the house takes away with him all the spiritual merit even of a man who subsists by gleaning ears of corn or offers oblations in five fires
grass room for resting water and fourthly a kind word these things never fail in the houses of good men
but a brahmana who stays one night only is declared to be a guest atithi for because he stays sthita not long anityam he is called atithi a guest
one must not consider as a guest a brahmana who dwells in the same village nor one who seeks his livelihood by social intercourse even though he has come to a house where there is a wife and where sacred fires are kept
those foolish householders who constantly seek to live on the food of others become in consequence of that baseness after death the cattle of those who give them food
a guest who is sent by the setting sun in the evening must not be driven away by a householder whether he have come at supper time or at an inopportune moment he must not stay in the house without entertainment
let him not eat any dainty food which he does not offer to his guest the hospitable reception of guests procures wealth fame long life and heavenly bliss
let him offer to his guests seats rooms beds attendance on departure and honour while they stay to the most distinguished in the best form to the lower ones in a lower form to equals in an equal manner
but if another guest comes after the vaisvadeva offering has been finished the householder must give him food according to his ability but not repeat the bali offering
a brahmana shall not name his family and vedic gotra in order to obtain a meal for he who boasts of them for the sake of a meal is called by the wise a foul feeder vantasin
but a kshatriya who comes to the house of a brahmana is not called a guest atithi nor a vaisya nor a sudra nor a personal friend nor a relative nor the teacher
but if a kshatriya comes to the house of a brahmana in the manner of a guest the householder may feed him according to his desire after the abovementioned brahmanas have eaten
even a vaisya and a sudra who have approached his house in the manner of guests he may allow to eat with his servants showing thereby his compassionate disposition
even to others personal friends and so forth who have come to his house out of affection he may give food garnished with seasoning according to his ability at the same time with his wife
without hesitation he may give food even before his guests to the following persons viz to newly married women to infants to the sick and to pregnant women
but the foolish man who eats first without having given food to these persons does while he crams not know that after death he himself will be devoured by dogs and vultures
after the brahmanas the kinsmen and the servants have dined the householder and his wife may afterwards eat what remains
having honoured the gods the sages men the manes and the guardian deities of the house the householder shall eat afterwards what remains
he who prepares food for himself alone eats nothing but sin for it is ordained that the food which remains after the performance of the sacrifices shall be the meal of virtuous men
let him honour with the honeymixture a king an officiating priest a snataka the teacher a soninlaw a fatherinlaw and a maternal uncle if they come again after a full year has elapsed since their last visit
a king and a srotriya who come on the performance of a sacrifice must be honoured with the honey mixture but not if no sacrifice is being performed that is a settled rule
but the wife shall offer in the evening a portion of the dressed food as a balioblation without the recitation of sacred formulas for that rite which is called the vaisvadeva is prescribed both for the morning and the evening
after performing the pitriyagna a brahmana who keeps a sacred fire shall offer month by month on the newmoon day the funeral sacrifice sraddha called pindanvaharyaka
the wise call the monthly funeral offering to the manes anvaharya to be offered after the cakes and that must be carefully performed with the approved sorts of flesh mentioned below
will fully declare what and how many brahmanas must be fed on that occasion who must be avoided and on what kinds of food they shall dine
one must feed two brahmanas at the offering to the gods and three at the offering to the manes or one only on either occasion even a very wealthy man shall not be anxious to entertain a large company
a large company destroys these five advantages the respectful treatment of the invited the propriety of place and time purity and the selection of virtuous brahmana guests he therefore shall not seek to entertain a large company
famed is this rite for the dead called the sacrifice sacred to the manes and performed on the new moon day if a man is diligent in performing that the reward of the rite for the dead which is performed according to smarta rules reaches him constantly
oblations to the gods and manes must be presented by the givers to a srotriya alone what is given to such a most worthy brahmana yields great reward
let him feed even one learned man at the sacrifice to the gods and one at the sacrifice to the manes thus he will gain a rich reward not if he entertains many who are unacquainted with the veda
let him make inquiries even regarding the remote ancestors of a brahmana who has studied an entire recension of the veda if descended from a virtuous race such a man is a worthy recipient of gifts consisting of food offered to the gods or to the manes he is declared to procure as great rewards as a guest atithi
though a million of men unaquainted with the rikas were to dine at a funeral sacrifice yet a single man learned in the veda who is satisfied with his entertainment is worth them all as far as the production of spiritual merit is concerned
food sacred to the manes or to the gods must be given to a man distinguished by sacred knowledge for hands smeared with blood cannot be cleansed with blood
as many mouthfuls as an ignorant man swallows at a sacrifice to the gods or to the manes so many red hot spikes spears and iron balls must the giver of the repast swallow after death
some brahmanas are devoted to the pursuit of knowledge and others to the performance of austerities some to austerities and to the recitation of the veda and others to the performance of sacred rites
oblations to the manes ought to be carefully presented to those devoted to knowledge but offerings to the gods in accordance with the reason of the sacred law to men of all the four abovementioned classes
if there is a father ignorant of the sacred texts whose son has learned one whole recension of the veda and the angas and a son ignorant of the sacred texts whose father knows an entire recension of the veda and the angas
know that he whose father knows the veda is the more venerable one of the two yet the other one is worthy of honour because respect is due to the veda which he has learned
let him not entertain a personal friend at a funeral sacrifice he may gain his affection by other valuable gifts let him feed at a sraddha a brahmana whom he considers neither as a foe nor as a friend
he who performs funeral sacrifices and offerings to the gods chiefly for the sake of gaining friends reaps after death no reward for sraddhas and sacrifices
that meanest among twicebom men who in his folly contracts friendships through a funeral sacrifice loses heaven because he performed a sraddha for the sake of friendship
a gift of food by twiceborn men consumed with friends and relatives is said to be offered to the pisakas it remains in this world alone like a blind cow in one stable
as a husbandman reaps no harvest when he has sown the seed in barren soil even so the giver of sacrificial food gains no reward if he presented it to a man unacquainted with the rikas
but a present made in accordance with the rules to a learned man makes the giver and the recipient partakers of rewards both in this life and after death
if no learned brahmana be at hand he may rather honour a virtuous friend than an enemy though the latter may be qualified by learning and so forth for sacrificial food eaten by a foe bears no reward after death
let him take pains to feed at a sraddha an adherent of the rigveda who has studied one entire recension of that veda or a follower of the yagurveda who has finished one sakha or a singer of samans who likewise has completed the study of an entire recension
if one of these three dines duly honoured at a funeral sacrifice the ancestors of him who gives the feast as far as the seventh person will be satisfied for a very long time
this is the chief rule to be followed in offering sacrifices to the gods and manes know that the virtuous always observe the following subsidiary rule
one may also entertain on such occasions ones maternal grandfather a maternal uncle a sisters son a fatherinlaw ones teacher a daughters son a daughters husband a cognate kinsman ones own officiating priest or a man for whom one offers sacrifices
for a rite sacred to the gods he who knows the law will not make too close inquiries regarding an invited brahmana but when one performs a ceremony in honour of the manes one must carefully examine the qualities and parentage of the guest
manu has declared that those brahmanas who are thieves outcasts eunuchs or atheists are unworthy to partake of oblations to the gods and manes
let him not entertain at a sraddha one who wears his hair in braids a student one who has not studied the veda one afflicted with a skindisease a gambler nor those who sacrifice for a multitude of sacrifices
physicians templepriests sellers of meat and those who subsist by shopkeeping must be avoided at sacrifices offered to the gods and to the manes
a paid servant of a village or of a king man with deformed nails or black teeth one who opposes his teacher one who has forsaken the sacred fire and a usurer
one suffering from consumption one who subsists by tending cattle a younger brother who marries or kindles the sacred fire before the elder one who neglects the five great sacrifices an enemy of the brahmana race an elder brother who marries or kindles the sacred fire after the younger and one who belongs to a company or corporation
an actor or singer one who has broken the vow of studentship one whose only or first wife is a sudra female the son of a remarried woman a oneeyed man and he in whose house a paramour of his wife resides
he who teaches for a stipulated fee and he who is taught on that condition he who instructs sudra pupils and he whose teacher is a sudra he who speaks rudely the son of an adulteress and the son of a widow
he who forsakes his mother his father or a teacher without a sufficient reason he who has contracted an alliance with outcasts either through the veda or through a marriage
an incendiary a prisoner he who eats the food given by the son of an adulteress a seller of soma he who undertakes voyages by sea a bard an oilman a suborner to perjury
he who wrangles or goes to law with his father the keeper of a gamblinghouse a drunkard he who is afflicted with a disease in punishment of former crimes he who is accused of a mortal sin a hypocrite a seller of substances used for flavouring food
a maker of bows and of arrows he who lasciviously dallies with a brothers widow the betrayer of a friend one who subsists by gambling he who learns the veda from his son
an epileptic man who suffers from scrofulous swellings of the glands one afflicted with white leprosy an informer a madman a blind man and he who cavils at the veda must all be avoided
a trainer of elephants oxen horses or camels he who subsists by astrology a birdfancier and he who teaches the use of arms
he who diverts watercourses and he who delights in obstructing them an architect a messenger and he who plants trees for money
a breeder of sportingdogs a falconer one who defiles maidens he who delights in injuring living creatures he who gains his subsistence from sudras and he who offers sacrifices to the ganas
he who does not follow the rule of conduct a man destitute of energy like a eunuch one who constantly asks for favours he who lives by agriculture a clubfooted man and he who is censured by virtuous men
a shepherd a keeper of buffaloes the husband of a remarried woman and a carrier of dead bodies all these must be carefully avoided
a brahmana who knows the sacred law should shun at sacrifices both to the gods and to the manes these lowest of twiceborn men whose conduct is reprehensible and who are unworthy to sit in the company at a repast
as a fire of dry grass is unable to consume the offerings and is quickly extinguished even so is it with an unlearned brahmana sacrificial food must not be given to him since it would be offered in ashes
will fully declare what result the giver obtains after death if he gives food destined for the gods or manes to a man who is unworthy to sit in the company
the rakshasas indeed consume the food eaten by brahmanas who have not fulfilled the vow of studentship by a parivettri and so forth and by other men not admissible into the company
he must be considered as a parivettri who marries or begins the performance of the agnihotra before his elder brother but the latter as a parivitti
the elder brother who marries after the younger the younger brother who marries before the elder the female with whom such a marriage is contracted he who gives her away and the sacrificing priest as the fifth all fall into hell
he who lasciviously dallies with the widow of a deceased brother though she be appointed to bear a child by him in accordance with the sacred law must be known to be a didhishupati
two kinds of sons a kunda and a golaka are born by wives of other men he who is bom while the husband lives will be a kunda and he who is begotten after the husbands death a golaka
but those two creatures who are bom of wives of other men cause to the giver the loss of the rewards both in this life and after death for the food sacred to gods or manes which has been given to them
the foolish giver of a funeral repast does not reap the reward for as many worthy guests as a man inadmissible into company can look on while they are feeding
a blind man by his presence causes to the giver of the feast the loss of the reward for ninety guests a oneeyed man for sixty one who suffers from white leprosy for a hundred and one punished by a terrible disease for a thousand
the giver of a sraddha loses the reward due for such a non sacrificial gift for as many brahmanas as a guest who sacrifices for sudras may touch during the meal with his limbs
and if a brahmana though learned in the veda accepts through covetousness a gift from such a man he will quickly perish like a vessel of unburnt clay in water
food given to a seller of soma becomes ordure that given to a physician pus and blood but that presented to a templepriest is lost and that given to a usurer finds no place in the world of the gods
what has been given to a brahmana who lives by trade that is not useful in this world and the next and a present to a brahmana bom of a remarried woman resembles an oblation thrown into ashes
but the wise declare that the food which is offered to other unholy inadmissible men enumerated above is turned into adipose secretions blood flesh marrow and bone
now heai by what chief of twicebom men a company defiled by the presence of unworthy guests is purified and the full description of the brahmanas who sanctify a company
those men must be considered as the sanctifiers of a company who are most learned in all the vedas and in all the angas and who are the descendants of srotriyas
a trinakiketa one who keeps five sacred fires a trisupama one who is versed in the six angas the son of a woman married according to the brahma rite one who sings the gyeshthasaman
one who knows the meaning of the veda and he who expounds it a student one who has given a thousand cows and a centenarian must be considered as brahmanas who sanctify a company
on the day before the sraddharite is performed or on the day when it takes place let him invite with due respect at least three brahmanas such as have been mentioned above
a brahmana who has been invited to a rite in honour of the manes shall always control himself and not recite the veda and he who performs the sraddha must act in the same manner
for the manes attend the invited brahmanas follow them when they walk like the wind and sit near them when they are seated
but a brahmana who being duly invited to a rite in honour of the gods or of the manes in any way breaks the appointment becomes guilty of a crime and in his next birth a hog
but he who being invited to a sraddha dallies with a sudra woman takes upon himself all the sins which the giver of the feast committed
the manes are primeval deities free from anger careful of purity ever chaste averse from strife and endowed with great virtues
now learn fully from whom all these manes derive their origin and with what ceremonies they ought to be worshipped
the various classes of the manes are declared to be the sons of all those sages mariki and the rest who are children of manu the son of hiranyagarbha
the somasads the sons of virag are stated to be the manes of the sadhyas and the agnishvattas the children of mariki are famous in the world as the manes of the gods
the barhishads bom of atri are recorded to be the manes of the daityas danavas yakshas gandharvas snakedeities rakshasas supamas and a kimnaras
the somapas those of the brahmanas the havirbhugs those of the kshatriyas the agyapas those of the vaisyas but the sukalins those of the sudras
the somapas are the sons of kavi bhrigu the havishmats the children of angiras the agyapas the offspring of pulastya but the sukalins the issue of vasishtha
one should know that other classes the agnidagdhas the anagnidagdhas the kavyas the barhishads the agnishvattas and the saumyas are the manes of the brahmanas alone
but know also that there exist in this world countless sons and grandsons of those chief classes of manes which have been enumerated
from the sages sprang the manes from the manes the gods and the danavas but from the gods the whole world both the movable and the immovable in due order
even water offered with faith to the manes in vessels made of silver or adorned with silver produces endless bliss
for twicebom men the rite in honour of the manes is more important than the rite in honour of the gods for the offering to the gods which precedes the sraddhas has been declared to be a means of fortifying the latter
let him first invite a brahmana in honour of the gods as a protection for the offering to the manes for the rakshasas destroy a funeral sacrifice which is left without such a protection
let him make the sraddha begin and end with a rite in honour of the gods it shall not begin and end with a rite to the manes for he who makes it begin and end with a rite in honour of the manes soon perishes together with his progeny
let him smear a pure and secluded place with cowdung and carefully make it sloping towards the south
the manes are always pleased with offerings made in open naturally pure places on the banks of rivers and in secluded spots
the sacrificer shall make the invited brahmanas who have duly performed their ablutions sit down on separate prepared seats on which blades of kusa grass have been placed
having placed those blameless brahmanas on their seats he shall honour them with fragrant garlands and perfumes beginning with those who are invited in honour of the gods
having presented to them water sesamum grains and blades of kusa grass the brahmana sacrificer shall offer oblations in the sacred fire after having received permission to do so from all the brahmana guests conjointly
having first according to the rule performed as a means of protecting the sraddha oblations to agni to soma and to yama let him afterwards satisfy the manes by a gift of sacrificial food
but if no sacred fire is available he shall place the offerings into the hand of a brahmana for brahmanas who know the sacred texts declare what fire is even such is a brahmana
they also call those first of twiceborn men the ancient deities of the funeral sacrifice free from anger easily pleased employed in making men prosper
after he has performed the oblations in the fire and the whole series of ceremonies in such a manner that they end in the south let him sprinkle water with his right hand on the spot where the cakes are to be placed
but having made three cakes out of the remainder of that sacrificial food he must concentrating his mind and turning towards the south place them on kusa grass exactly in the same manner in which he poured out the libations of water
having offered those cakes according to the prescribed rule being pure let him wipe the same hand with the roots of those blades of kusa grass for the sake of the three ancestors who partake of the wipings lepa
having next sipped water turned round towards the north and thrice slowly suppressed his breath the sacrificer who knows the sacred texts shall worship the guardian deities of the six seasons and the manes
let him gently pour out the remainder of the water near the cakes and with fixed attention smell those cakes in the order in which they were placed on the ground
but taking successively very small portions from the cakes he shall make those seated brahmana eat them in accordance with the rule before their dinner
but if the sacrificers father is living he must offer the cakes to three remoter ancestors or he may also feed his father at the funeral sacrifice as one of the brahmana guests
but he whose father is dead while his grandfather lives shall after pronouncing his fathers name mention that of his greatgrandfather
manu has declared that either the grandfather may eat at that sraddha as a guest or the grandson having received permission may perform it as he desires
having poured water mixed with sesamum in which a blade of kusa grass has been placed into the hands of the guests he shall give to each that abovementioned portion of the cake saying to those svadha
but carrying the vessel filled with food with both hands the sacrificer himself shall gently place it before the brahmanas meditating on the manes
the malevolent asuras forcibly snatch away that food which is brought without being held with both hands
let him being pure and attentive carefully place on the ground the seasoning for the rice such as broths and pot herbs sweet and sour milk and honey
as well as various kinds of hard food which require mastication and of soft food roots fruits savoury meat and fragrant drinks
all this he shall present to his guests being pure and attentive successively invite them to partake of each dish proclaiming its qualities
let him on no account drop a tear become angry or utter an untruth nor let him touch the food with his foot nor violently shake it
a tear sends the food to the pretas anger to his enemies a falsehood to the dogs contact with his foot to the rakshasas a shaking to the sinners
whatever may please the brahmanas let him give without grudging it let him give riddles from the veda for that is agreeable to the manes
at a sacrifice in honour of the manes he must let his guests hear the veda the institutes of the sacred law legends tales puranas and khilas
himself being delighted let him give delight to the brahmanas cause them to partake gradually and slowly of each dish and repeatedly invite them to eat by offering the food and praising its qualities
let him eagerly entertain at a funeral sacrifice a daughters son though he be a student and let him place a nepal blanket on the on the seat of each guest scattering sesamum grains on the ground
there are three means of sanctification to be used at a sraddha a daughters son a nepal blanket and sesamum grains and they recommend three other things for it cleanliness suppression of anger and absence of haste
all the food must be very hot and the guests shall eat in silence even though asked by the giver of the feast the brahmanas shall not proclaim the qualities of the sacrificial food
as long as the food remains warm as long as they eat in silence as long as the qualities of the food are not proclaimed so long the manes partake of it
what a guest eats covering his head what he eats with his face turned towards the south what he eats with sandals on his feet that the rakshasas consume
a kandala a village pig a cock a dog a menstruating woman and a eunuch must not look at the brahmanas while they eat
what any of these sees at a burntoblation at a solemn gift at a dinner given to brahmanas or at any rite in honour of the gods and manes that produces not the intended result
a boar makes the rite useless by inhaling the smell of the offerings a cock by the air of his wings a dog by throwing his eye on them a lowcaste man by touching them
if a lame man a oneeyed man one deficient in a limb or one with a redundant limb be even the servant of the performer of the sraddha he must be removed from that place where the sraddha is held
to a brahmana householder or to an ascetic who comes for food he may with the permission of his brahmana guests show honour according to his ability
let him mix all the kinds of food together sprinkle them with water and put them scattering them on kusa grass down on the ground in front of his guests when they have finished their meal
the remnant in the dishes and the portion scattered on kusa grass shall be the share of deceased children who received not the sacrament of cremation and of those who unjustly forsook noble wives
they declare the fragments which have fallen on the ground at a sraddha to the manes to be the share of honest dutiful servants
but before the performance of the sapindikarana one must feed at the funeral sacrifice in honour of a recently deceased aryan one brahmana without making an offering to the gods and give one cake only
but after the sapindikarana of the deceased father has been performed according to the sacred law the sons must offer the cakes with those ceremonies described above
the foolish man who after having eaten a sraddha dinner gives the leavings to a sudra falls headlong into the kalasutra hell
if the partaker of a sraddha dinner enters on the same day the bed of a sudra female the manes of his ancestors will lie during that month in her ordure
having addressed the question have you dined well to his guests let him give water for sipping to them who are satisfied and dismiss them after they have sipped water with the words rest either here or at home
the brahmana guests shall then answer him let there be svadha for at all rites in honour of the manes the word svadha is the highest benison
next let him inform his guests who have finished their meal of the food which remains with the permission of the brahmanas let him dispose of that as they may direct
at a sraddha in honour of the manes one must use in asking of the guests if they are satisfied the word svaditam at a goshthi sraddha the word susrutam at a vriddhi sraddha the word sampannam and at a rite in honour of the gods the word rukitam
the afternoon kusa grass the due preparation of the dwelling sesamum grains liberality the careful preparation of the food and the company of distinguished brahmanas are true riches at all funeral sacrifices
know that kusa grass purificatory texts the morning sacrificial viands of all kinds and those means of purification mentioned above are blessings at a sacrifice to the gods
the food eaten by hermits in the forest milk somajuice meat which is not prepared with spices and salt unprepared by art are called on account of their nature sacrificial food
having dismissed the invited brahmanas let him with a concentrated mind silent and pure look towards the south and ask these blessings of the manes
may liberal men abound with us may our knowledge of the vedas and our progeny increase may faith not forsake us may we have much to give to the needy
having thus offered the cakes let him after the prayer cause a cow a brahmana a goat or the sacred fire to consume those cakes or let him throw them into water
some make the offering of the cakes after the dinner some cause them to be eaten by birds or throw them into fire or into water
the sacrificers first wife who is faithful and intent on the worship of the manes may eat the middle most cake if she be desirous of bearing a son
thus she will bring forth a son who will be longlived famous intelligent rich the father of numerous offspring endowed with the quality of goodness and righteous
having washed his hands and sipped water let him prepare food for his paternal relations and after giving it to them with due respect let him feed his maternal relatives also
but the remnants shall be left where they lie until the brahmanas have been dismissed afterwards he shall perform the daily domestic balioffering that is a settled rule of the sacred law
will now fully declare what kind of sacrificial food given to the manes according to the rule will serve for a long time or for eternity
the ancestors of men are satisfied for one month with sesamum grains rice barley masha beans water roots and fruits which have been given according to the prescribed rule
two months with fish three months with the meat of gazelles four with mutton and five indeed with the flesh of birds
six months with the flesh of kids seven with that of spotted deer eight with that of the black antelope but nine with that of the deer called ruru
ten months they are satisfied with the meat of boars and buffaloes but eleven months indeed with that of hares and tortoises
one year with cowmilk and milkrice from the flesh of a longeared white hegoat their satisfaction endures twelve years
the vegetable called kalasaka the fish called mahasalka the flesh of a rhinoceros and that of a red goat and all kinds of food eaten by hermits in the forest serve for an endless time
whatever food mixed with honey one gives on the thirteenth lunar day in the rainy season under the asterism of maghah that also procures endless satisfaction
may such a man the manes say be bom in our family who will give us milkrice with honey and clarified butter on the thirteenth lunar day of the month of bhadrapada and in the afternoon when the shadow of an elephant falls towards the east
whatever a man full of faith duly gives according to the prescribed rule that becomes in the other world a perpetual and imperishable gratification for the manes
the days of the dark half of the month beginning with the tenth but excepting the fourteenth are recommended for a funeral sacrifice it is not thus with the others
he who performs it on the even lunar days and under the even constellations gains the fulfilment of all his wishes he who honours the manes on odd lunar days and under odd constellations obtains distinguished offspring
as the second half of the month is preferable to the first half even so the afternoon is better for the performance of a funeral sacrifice than the forenoon
let him untired duly perform the rites in honour of the manes in accordance with the prescribed rule passing the sacred thread over the right shoulder proceeding from the left to the right and holding kusa grass in his hands up to the end of the ceremony
let him not perform a funeral sacrifice at night because the night is declared to belong to the rakshasas nor in the twilight nor when the sun has just risen
let him offer here below a funeral sacrifice according to the rule given above at least thrice a year in winter in summer and in the rainy season but that which is included among the five great sacrifices every day
the burntoblation offered at a sacrifice to the manes must not be made in a common fire a brahmana who keeps a sacred fire shall not perform a funeral sacrifice except on the newmoon day
even when a brahmana after bathing satisfies the manes with water he obtains thereby the whole reward for the performance of the daily sraddha
they call the manes of fathers vasus those of grandfathers rudras and those of greatgrandfathers adityas thus speaks the eternal veda
let him daily partake of the vighasa and daily eat amrita ambrosia but vighasa is what remains from the meal of brahmana guests and the remainder of a sacrifice is called amrita
thus all the ordinances relating to the five daily great sacrifices have been declared to you hear now the law for the manner of living fit for brahmanas
having dwelt with a teacher during the fourth part of a mans life a brahmana shall live during the second quarter of his existence in his house after he has wedded a wife
a brahmana must seek a means of subsistence which either causes no or at least little pain to others and live by that except in times of distress
for the purpose of gaining bare subsistence let him accumulate property by following those irreproachable occupations which are prescribed for his caste without unduly fatiguing his body
he may subsist by rita truth and amrita ambrosia or by mrita death and by pramrita what causes many deaths or even by the mode called satyanrita a mixture of truth and falsehood but never by svavritti a dogs mode of life
by rita shall be understood the gleaning of corn by amrita what is given unasked by mrita food obtained by begging and agriculture is declared to be pramrita
but trade and moneylending are satyanrita even by that one may subsist service is called svavritti therefore one should avoid it
he may either possess enough to fill a granary or a store filling a grainjar or he may collect what suffices for three days or make no provision for the morrow
moreover among these four brahmana householders each laternamed must be considered more distinguished and through his virtue to have conquered the world more completely
one of these follows six occupations another subsists by three one by two but the fourth lives by the brahmasattra
he who maintains himself by picking up grains and ears of corn must be always intent on the performance of the agnihotra and constantly offer those ishtis only which are prescribed for the days of the conjunction and opposition of the moon and for the solstices
let him never for the sake of subsistence follow the ways of the world let him live the pure straightforward honest life of a brahmana
he who desires happiness must strive after a perfectly contented disposition and control himself for happiness has contentment for its root the root of unhappiness is the contrary disposition
a brahmana who is a snataka and subsists by one of the abovementioned modes of life must discharge the following duties which secure heavenly bliss long life and fame
let him untired perform daily the rites prescribed for him in the veda for he who performs those according to his ability attains to the highest state
whether he be rich or even in distress let him not seek wealth through pursuits to which men cleave nor by forbidden occupations nor let him accept presents from any giver whosoever he may be
let him not out of desire for enjoyments attach himself to any sensual pleasures and let him carefully obviate an excessive attachment to them by reflecting on their worthlessness in his heart
let him avoid all means of acquiring wealth which impede the study of the veda let him maintain himself anyhow but study because that devotion to the vedastudy secures the realisation of his aims
let him walk here on earth bringing his dress speech and thoughts to a conformity with his age his occupation his wealth his sacred learning and his race
let him daily pore over those institutes of science which soon give increase of wisdom those which teach the acquisition of wealth those which are beneficial for other worldly concerns and likewise over the nigamas which explain the veda
for the more a man completely studies the institutes of science the more he fully understands them and his great learning shines brightly
let him never if he is able to perform them neglect the sacrifices to the sages to the gods to the bhutas to men and to the manes
some men who know the ordinances for sacrificial rites always offer these great sacrifices in their organs of sensation without any external effort
knowing that the performance of the sacrifice in their speech and their breath yields imperishable rewards some always offer their breath in their speech and their speech in their breath
other brahmanas seeing with the eye of knowledge that the performance of those rites has knowledge for its root always perform them through knowledge alone
a brahmana shall always offer the agnihotra at the beginning or at the end of the day and of the night and the darsa and paumamasa ishtis at the end of each halfmonth
when the old grain has been consumed the agrayana ishti with new grain at the end of the three seasons the katurmasya sacrifices at the solstices an animal sacrifice at the end of the year soma offerings
a brahmana who keeps sacred fires shall if he desires to live long not eat new grain or meat without having offered the agrayana ishti with new grain and an animalsacrifice
for his fires not being worshipped by offerings of new grain and of an animal seek to devour his vital spirits because they are greedy for new grain and flesh
no guest must stay in his house without being honoured according to his ability with a seat food a couch water or roots and fruits
let him not honour even by a greeting heretics men who follow forbidden occupations men who live like cats rogues logicians arguing against the veda and those who live like herons
those who have become snatakas after studying the veda or after completing their vows and householders who are srotriyas one must worship by gifts of food sacred to gods and manes but one must avoid those who are different
a householder must give as much food as he is able to spare to those who do not cook for themselves and to all beings one must distribute food without detriment to ones own interest
a snataka who pines with hunger may beg wealth of a king of one for whom he sacrifices and of a pupil but not of others that is a settled rule
a snataka who is able to procure food shall never waste himself with hunger nor shall he wear old or dirty clothes if he possesses property
keeping his hair nails and beard clipped subduing his passions by austerities wearing white garments and keeping himself pure he shall be always engaged in studying the veda and such acts as are conducive to his welfare
he shall carry a staff of bamboo a pot full of water a sacred string a bundle of kusa grass and wear two bright golden earrings
let him never look at the sun when he sets or rises is eclipsed or reflected in water or stands in the middle of the sky
let him not step over a rope to which a calf is tied let him not run when it rains and let him not look at his own image in water that is a settled rule
let him pass by a mound of earth a cow an idol a brahmana clarified butter honey a crossway and wellknown trees turning his right hand towards them
let him though mad with desire not approach his wife when her courses appear nor let him sleep with her in the same bed
for the wisdom the energy the strength the sight and the vitality of a man who approaches a woman covered with menstrual excretions utterly perish
if he avoids her while she is in that condition his wisdom energy strength sight and vitality will increase
let him not eat in the company of his wife nor look at her while she eats sneezes yawns or sits at her ease
a brahmana who desires energy must not look at a woman who applies collyrium to her eyes has anointed or uncovered herself or brings forth a child
let him not eat dressed with one garment only let him not bathe naked let him not void urine on a road on ashes or in a cowpen
nor on ploughed land in water on an altar of bricks on a mountain on the ruins of a temple nor ever on an anthill
nor in holes inhabited by living creatures nor while he walks or stands nor on reaching the bank of a river nor on the top of a mountain
let him never void faeces or urine facing the wind or a fire or looking towards a brahmana the sun water or cows
he may ease himself having covered the ground with sticks clods leaves grass and the like restraining his speech keeping himself pure wrapping up his body and covering his head
let him void faeces and urine in the daytime turning to the north at night turning towards the south during the two twilights in the same position as by day
in the shade or in darkness a brahmana may both by day and at night do it assuming any position he pleases likewise when his life is in danger
the intellect of a man who voids urine against a fire the sun the moon in water against a brahmana a cow or the wind perishes
let him not blow a fire with his mouth let him not look at a naked woman let him not throw any impure substance into the fire and let him not warm his feet at it
let him not place fire under a bed or the like nor step over it nor place it when he sleeps at the foot end of his bed let him not torment living creatures

the morning sun the smoke rising from a burning corpse and a broken seat must be avoided let him not clip his nails or hair and not tear his nails with his teeth
let him not crush earth or clods nor tear off grass with his nails let him not do anything that is useless or will have disagreeable results in the future

let him not give to a sudra advice nor the remnants of his meal nor food offered to the gods nor let him explain the sacred law to such a man nor impose upon him a penance
for he who explains the sacred law to a sudra or dictates to him a penance will sink together with that man into the hell called asamvrita
let him not scratch his head with both hands joined let him not touch it while he is impure nor bathe without submerging it
let him avoid in anger to lay hold of his own or other mens hair or to strike himself or others on the head when he has bathed submerging his head he shall not touch any of his limbs with oil
let him not accept presents from a king who is not descended from the kshatriya race nor from butchers oilmanufacturers and publicans nor from those who subsist by the gain of prostitutes
one oilpress is as bad as ten slaughterhouses one tavern as bad as ten oilpresses one brothel as bad as ten taverns one king as bad as ten brothels
a king is declared to be equal in wickedness to a butcher who keeps a hundred thousand slaughter houses to accept presents from him is a terrible crime
he who accepts presents from an avaricious king who acts contrary to the institutes of the sacred law will go in succession to the following twentyone hells
tamisra andhatamisra maharaurava raurava the kalasutra hell mahanaraka
samgivana mahaviki tapana sampratapana samghata sakakola kudmala putimrittika
lohasanku rigisha pathin the flaming river salmala asipatravana and lohakaraka
learned brahmanas who know that who study the veda and desire bliss after death do not accept presents from a king
let him wake in the muhurta sacred to brahman and think of the acquisition of spiritual merit and wealth of the bodily fatigue arising therefrom and of the true meaning of the veda
when he has risen has relieved the necessities of nature and carefully purified himself let him stand during the morning twilight muttering for a long time the gayatri and at the proper time he must similarly perform the evening devotion
by prolonging the twilight devotions the sages obtained long life wisdom honour fame and excellence in vedic knowledge
having performed the upakarman according to the prescribed rule on the full moon of the month sravana or on that of praushthapada bhadrapada a brahmana shall diligently study the vedas during four months and a half
when the pushyaday of the month pausha or the first day of the bright half of magha has come a brahmana shall perform in the forenoon the utsargana of the vedas
having performed the utsarga outside the village as the institutes of the sacred law prescribe he shall stop reading during two days and the intervening night or during that day of the utsarga and the following night
afterwards he shall diligently recite the vedas during the bright halves of the months and duly study all the angas of the vedas during the dark fortnights
let him not recite the texts indistinctly nor in the presence of sudras nor let him if in the latter part of the night he is tired with reciting the veda go again to sleep
according to the rule declared above let him recite the daily portion of the mantras and a zealous brahmana who is not in distress shall study the brahmana and the mantrasamhita
let him who studies always avoid reading on the following occasions when the vedastudy is forbidden and let him who teaches pupils according to the prescribed rule do it likewise
those who know the rules of recitation declare that in the rainy season the vedastudy must be stopped on these two occasions when the wind is audible at night and when it whirls up the dust in the daytime
manu has stated that when lightning thunder and rain are observed together or when large fiery meteors fall on all sides the recitation must be interrupted until the same hour on the next day counting from the occurrence of the event
when one perceives these phenomena all together in the twilight after the sacred fires have been made to blaze for the performance of the agnihotra then one must know the recitation of the veda to be forbidden and also when clouds appear out of season
on the occasion of a preternatural sound from the sky of an earthquake and when the lights of heaven are surrounded by a halo let him know that the vedastudy must be stopped until the same hour on the next day even if these phenomena happen in the rainy season
but when lightning and the roar of thunder are observed after the sacred fires have been made to blaze the stoppage shall last as long as the light of the sun or of the stars is visible if the remaining abovenamed phenomenon rain occurs the reading shall cease both in the daytime and at night
for those who wish to acquire exceedingiy great merit a continual interruption of the vedastudy is prescribed in villages and in towns and the vedastudy must always cease when any kind of foul smell is perceptible
in a village where a corpse lies in the presence of a man who lives as unrighteously as a sudra while the sound of weeping is heard and in a crowd of men the recitation of the veda must be stopped
in water during the middle part of the night while he voids excrements or is impure and after he has partaken of a funeral dinner a man must not even think in his heart of the sacred texts
a learned brahmana shall not recite the veda during three days when he has accepted an invitation to a funeral rite in honour of one ancestor ekoddishta or when the king has become impure through a birth or death in his family sutaka or when rahu by an eclipse makes the moon impure
as long as the smell and the stains of the food given in honour of one ancestor remain on the body of a learned brahmana so long he must not recite the veda
while lying on a bed while his feet are raised on a bench while he sits on his hams with a cloth tied round his knees let him not study nor when he has eaten meat or food given by a person impure on account of a birth or a death
nor during a fog nor while the sound of arrows is audible nor during both the twilights nor on the new moon day nor on the fourteenth and the eighth days of each halfmonth nor on the fullmoon day
the newmoon day destroys the teacher the fourteenth day the pupil the eighth and the fullmoon days destroy all remembrance of the veda let him therefore avoid reading on those days
a brahmana shall not recite the veda during a duststorm nor while the sky is pretematurally red nor while jackals howl nor while the barking of dogs the braying of donkeys or the grunting of camels is heard nor while he is seated in a company
let him not study near a burialground nor near a village nor in a cowpen nor dressed in a garment which he wore during conjugal intercourse nor after receiving a present at a funeral sacrifice
be it an animal or a thing inanimate whatever be the gift at a sraddha let him not having just accepted it recite the veda for the hand of a brahmana is his mouth
when the village has been beset by robbers and when an alarm has been raised by fire let him know that the veda study must be interrupted until the same hour on the next day and on the occurrence of all portents
on the occasion of the upakarman and of the vedotsarga an omission of the vedastudy for three days has been prescribed but on the ashtakas and on the last nights of the seasons for a day and a night
let him not recite the veda on horseback nor on a tree nor on an elephant nor in a boat or ship nor on a donkey nor on camel nor standing on barren ground nor riding in a carriage
nor during a verbal altercation nor during a mutual assault nor in a camp nor during a battle nor when he has just eaten nor during an indigestion nor after vomiting nor with sour eructations
nor without receiving permission from a guest who stays in his house nor while the wind blows vehemently nor while blood flows from his body nor when he is wounded by a weapon
let him never recite the rigveda or the yagurveda while the saman melodies are heard let him stop all vedastudy for a day and a night after finishing a veda or after reciting an aranyaka
the rigveda is declared to be sacred to the gods the yagurveda sacred to men and the samaveda sacred to the manes hence the sound of the latter is impure as it were
knowing this the learned daily repeat first in due order the essence of the three vedas and afterwards the text of the veda
know that the vedastudy must be interrupted for a day and a night when cattle a frog a cat a dog a snake an ichneumon or a rat pass between the teacher and his pupil
let a twicebom man always carefully interrupt the vedastudy on two occasions viz when the place where he recites is impure and when he himself is unpurified
a twiceborn man who is a snataka shall remain chaste on the newmoon day on the eighth lunar day of each halfmonth on the fullmoon day and on the fourteenth even if they fall in the period proper for conjugal intercourse
let him not bathe immediately after a meal nor when he is sick nor in the middle of the night nor frequently dressed in all his garments nor in a pool which he does not perfectly know
let him not intentionally step on the shadow of images of the gods of a guru of a king of a snataka of his teacher of a reddishbrown animal or of one who has been initiated to the performance of a srauta sacrifice dikshita
at midday and at midnight after partaking of meat at a funeral dinner and in the two twilights let him not stay long on a crossroad
let him not step intentionally on things used for cleansing the body on water used for a bath on urine or ordure on blood on mucus and on anything spat out or vomited
let him not show particular attention to an enemy to the friend of an enemy to a wicked man to a thief or to the wife of another man
for in this world there is nothing so detrimental to long life as criminal conversation with another mans wife
let him who desires prosperity indeed never despise a kshatriya a snake and a learned brahmana be they ever so feeble
because these three when treated with disrespect may utterly destroy him hence a wise man must never despise them
let him not despise himself on account of former failures until death let him seek fortune nor despair of gaining it
let him say what is true let him say what is pleasing let him utter no disagreeable truth and let him utter no agreeable falsehood that is the eternal law
what is well let him call well or let him say well only let him not engage in a useless enmity or dispute with anybody
let him not journey too early in the morning nor too late in the evening nor just during the midday heat nor with an unknown companion nor alone nor with sudras
let him not insult those who have redundant limbs or are deficient in limbs nor those destitute of knowledge nor very aged men nor those who have no beauty or wealth nor those who are of low birth
a brahmana who is impure must not touch with his hand a cow a brahmana or fire nor being in good health let him look at the luminaries in the sky while he is impure
if he has touched these while impure let him always sprinkle with his hand water on the organs of sensation all his limbs and the navel
except when sick he must not touch the cavities of the body without a reason and he must avoid to touch the hair on the secret parts
let him eagerly follow the customs which are auspicious and the rule of good conduct be careful of purity and control all his organs let him mutter prayers and untired daily offer oblations in the fire
no calamity happens to those who eagerly follow auspicious customs and the rule of good conduct to those who are always careful of purity and to those who mutter sacred texts and offer burntoblations
let him without tiring daily mutter the veda at the proper time for they declare that to be ones highest duty all other observances are called secondary duties
by daily reciting the veda by the observance of the rules of purification by practising austerities and by doing no injury to created beings one obtains the faculty of remembering former births
he who recollecting his former existences again recites the veda gains endless bliss by the continual study of the veda
let him always offer on the parvadays oblations to savitri and such as avert evil omens and on the ashtakas and anvashtakas let him constantly worship the manes
far from his dwelling let him remove urine and ordure far let him remove the water used for washing his feet and far the remnants of food and the water from his bath
early in the morning only let him void faeces decorate his body bathe clean his teeth apply collyrium to his eyes and worship the gods
but on the parvadays let him go to visit the images of the gods and virtuous brahmanas and the ruler of the country for the sake of protection as well as his gurus
let him reverentially salute venerable men who visit him give them his own seat let him sit near them with joined hands and when they leave accompany them walking behind them
let him untired follow the conduct of virtuous men connected with his occupations which has been fully declared in the revealed texts and in the sacred tradition smriti and is the root of the sacred law
through virtuous conduct he obtains long life through virtuous conduct desirable offspring through virtuous conduct imperishable wealth virtuous conduct destroys the effect of inauspicious marks
lor a man of bad conduct is blamed among people constantly suffers misfortunes is afflicted with diseases and shortlived
a man who follows the conduct of the virtuous has faith and is free from envy lives a hundred years though he be entirely destitute of auspicious marks
let him carefully avoid all undertakings the success of which depends on others but let him eagerly pursue that the accomplishment of which depends on himself
everything that depends on others gives pain everything that depends on oneself gives pleasure know that this is the short definition of pleasure and pain
when the performance of an act gladdens his heart let him perform it with diligence but let him avoid the opposite
let him never offend the teacher who initiated him nor him who explained the veda nor his father and mother nor any other guru nor cows nor brahmanas nor any men performing austerities
let him avoid atheism cavilling at the vedas contempt of the gods hatred want of modesty pride anger and harshness
let him when angry not raise a stick against another man nor strike anybody except a son or a pupil those two he may beat in order to correct them
a twiceborn man who has merely threatened a brahmana with the intention of doing him a corporal injury will wander about for a hundred years in the tamisra hell
having intentionally struck him in anger even with a blade of grass he will be bom during twentyone existences in the wombs of such beings where men are born in punishment of their sins
a man who in his folly caused blood to flow from the body of a brahmana who does not attack him will suffer after death exceedingly great pain
as many particles of dust as the blood takes up from the ground during so many years the spiller of the blood will be devoured by other animals in the next world
a wise man should therefore never threaten a brahmana nor strike him even with a blade of grass nor cause his blood to flow
neither a man who lives unrighteously nor he who acquires wealth by telling falsehoods nor he who always delights in doing injury ever attain happiness in this world
let him though suffering in consequence of his righteousness never turn his heart to unrighteousness for he will see the speedy overthrow of unrighteous wicked men
unrighteousness practised in this world does not at once produce its fruit like a cow but advancing slowly it cuts off the roots of him who committed it
if the punishment falls not on the offender himself it falls on his sons if not on the sons at least on his grandsons but an iniquity once committed never fails to produce fruit to him who wrought it
he prospers for a while through unrighteousness then he gains great good fortune next he conquers his enemies but at last he perishes branch and root
let him always delight in truthfulness obedience to the sacred law conduct worthy of an aryan and purity let him chastise his pupils according to the sacred law let him keep his speech his arms and his belly under control
let him avoid the acquisition of wealth and the gratification of his desires if they are opposed to the sacred law and even lawful acts which may cause pain in the future or are offensive to men
let him not be uselessly active with his hands and feet or with his eyes nor crooked in his ways nor talk idly nor injure others by deeds or even think of it
let him walk in that path of holy men which his fathers and his grandfathers followed while he walks in that he will not suffer harm
with an officiating or a domestic priest with a teacher with a maternal uncle a guest and a dependant with infants aged and sick men with learned men with his paternal relatives connexions by marriage and maternal relatives
with his father and his mother with female relatives with a brother with his son and his wife with his daughter and with his slaves let him not have quarrels
if he avoids quarrels with these persons he will be freed from all sins and by suppressing all such quarrels a householder conquers all the following worlds
the teacher is the lord of the world of brahman the father has power over the world of the lord of created beings pragapati a guest rules over the world of indra and the priests over the world of the gods
the female relatives have power over the world of the apsarases the maternal relatives over that of the visve devas the connexions by marriage over that of the waters the mother and the maternal uncle over the earth
infants aged poor and sick men must be considered as rulers of the middle sphere the eldest brother as equal to ones father ones wife and ones son as ones own body
ones slaves as ones shadow ones daughter as the highest object of tenderness hence if one is offended by any one of these one must bear it without resentment
though by his learning and sanctity he may be entitled to accept presents let him not attach himself too much to that habit for through his accepting many presents the divine light in him is soon extinguished
without a full knowledge of the rules prescribed by the sacred law for the acceptance of presents a wise man should not take anything even though he may pine with hunger
but an ignorant man who accepts gold land a horse a cow food a dress sesamumgrains or clarified butter is reduced to ashes like a piece of wood
gold and food destroy his longevity land and a cow his body a horse his eye sight a garment his skin clarified butter his energy sesamumgrains his offspring
a brahmana who neither performs austerities nor studies the veda yet delights in accepting gifts sinks with the donor into hell just as he who attempts to cross over in a boat made of stone is submerged in the water
hence an ignorant man should be afraid of accepting any presents for by reason of a very small gift even a fool sinks into hell as a cow into a morass
a man who knows the law should not offer even water to a brahmana who acts like a cat nor to a brahmana who acts like a heron nor to one who is unacquainted with the veda
for property though earned in accordance with prescribed rules which is given to these three persons causes in the next world misery both to the giver and to the recipient
as he who attempts to cross water in a boat of stone sinks to the bottom even so an ignorant donor and an ignorant donee sink low
a man who ever covetous displays the flag of virtue who is a hypocrite a deceiver of the people intent on doing injury and a detractor from the merits of all men one must know to be one who acts like a cat
that brahmana who with downcast look of a cruel disposition is solely intent on attaining his own ends dishonest and falsely gentle is one who acts like a heron
those brahmanas who act like herons and those who display the characteristics of cats fall in consequence of that wicked mode of acting into the hell called andhatamisra
when he has committed a sin let him not perform a penance under the pretence that the act is intended to gain spiritual merit thus hiding his sin under the pretext of a vow and deceiving women and sudras
such brahmanas are reprehended after death and in this life by those who expound the veda and a vow performed under a false pretence goes to the rakshasas
he who without being a student gains his livelihood by wearing the dress of a student takes upon himself the guilt of all students and is bom again in the womb of an animal
let him never bathe in tanks belonging to other men if he bathes in such a one he is tainted by a portion of the guilt of him who made the tank
he who uses without permission a carriage a bed a seat a well a garden or a house belonging to an other man takes upon himself one fourth of the owners guilt
let him always bathe in rivers in ponds dug by the gods themselves in lakes and in waterholes or springs
a wise man should constantly discharge the paramount duties called yama but not always the minor ones called niyama for he who does not discharge the former while he obeys the latter alone becomes an outcast
a brahmana must never eat a dinner given at a sacrifice that is offered by one who is not a srotriya by one who sacrifices for a multitude of men by a woman or by a eunuch
when those persons offer sacrificial viands in the fire it is unlucky for holy men it displeases the gods let him therefore avoid it
let him never eat food given by intoxicated angry or sick men nor that in which hair or insects are found nor what has been touched intentionally with the foot
nor that at which the slayer of a learned brahmana has looked nor that which has been touched by a menstruating woman nor that which has been pecked at by birds or touched by a dog
nor food at which a cow has smelt nor particularly that which has been offered by an invitation to all comers nor that given by a multitude or by harlots nor that which is declared to be had by a learned man
nor the food given by a thief a musician a carpenter a usurer one who has been initiated for the performance of a srauta sacrifice a miser one bound with fetters
by one accused of a mortal sin abhisasta a hermaphrodite an unchaste woman or a hypocrite nor any sweet thing that has turned sour nor what has been kept a whole night nor the food of a sudra nor the leavings of another man
nor the food given by a physician a hunter a cruel man one who eats the fragments of anothers meal nor the food of an ugra nor that prepared for a woman in childbed nor that given at a dinner where a guest rises prematurely and sips water nor that given by a woman whose ten days of impurity have not elapsed
nor food given without due respect nor that which contains meat eaten for no sacred purpose nor that given by a female who has no male relatives nor the food of an enemy nor that given by the lord of a town nor that given by outcasts nor that on which anybody has sneezed
nor the food given by an informer by one who habitually tells falsehoods or by one who sells the rewards for sacrifices nor the food given by an actor a tailor or an ungrateful man
by a blacksmith a nishada a stageplayer a goldsmith a basketmaker or a dealer in weapons
by trainers of hunting dogs publicans a washerman a dyer a pitiless man and a man in whose house lives a paramour of his wife
nor the food given by those who knowingly bear with paramours of their wives and by those who in all matters are ruled by women nor food given by men whose ten days of impurity on account of a death have not passed nor that which is unpalatable
the food of a king impairs his vigour the food of a sudra his excellence in sacred learning the food of a goldsmith his longevity that of a leathercutter his fame
the food of an artisan destroys his offspring that of a washerman his bodily strength the food of a multitude and of harlots excludes him from the higher worlds
the food of a physician is as vile as pus that of an unchaste woman equal to semen that of a usurer as vile as ordure and that of a dealer in weapons as bad as dirt
the food of those other persons who have been successively enumerated as such whose food must not be eaten the wise declare to be as impure as skin bones and hair
if he has unwittingly eaten the food of one of those he must fast for three days if he has eaten it intentionally or has swallowed semen ordure or urine he must perform a krikkhra penance
a brahmana who knows the law must not eat cooked food given by a sudra who performs no sraddhas but on failure of other means of subsistence he may accept raw grain sufficient for one night and day
the gods having considered the respective merits of a niggardly srotriya and of a liberal usurer declared the food of both to be equal in quality
the lord of created beings pragapati came and spake to them do not make that equal which is unequal the food of that liberal usurer is purified by faith that of the of the other man is defiled by a want of faith
let him without tiring always offer sacrifices and perform works of charity with faith for offerings and charitable works made with faith and with lawfullyearned money procure endless rewards
let him always practise according to his ability with a cheerful heart the duty of liberality both by sacrifices and by charitable works if he finds a worthy recipient for his gifts
if he is asked let him always give something be it ever so little without grudging for a worthy recipient will perhaps be found who saves him from all guilt
a giver of water obtains the satisfaction of his hunger and thirst a giver of food imperishable happiness a giver of sesamum desirable offspring a giver of a lamp a most excellent eyesight
a giver of land obtains land a giver of gold long life a giver of a house most excellent mansions a giver of silver rupya exquisite beauty rupa
a giver of a garment a place in the world of the moon a giver of a horse asva a place in the world of the asvins a giver of a draughtox great good fortune a giver of a cow the world of the sun
a giver of a carriage or of a bed a wife a giver of protection supreme dominion a giver of grain eternal bliss a giver of the veda brahman union with brahman
the gift of the veda surpasses all other gifts water food cows land clothes sesamum gold and clarified butter
for whatever purpose a man bestows any gift for that same purpose he receives in his next birth with due honour its reward
both he who respectfully receives a gift and he who respectfully bestows it go to heaven in the contrary case they both fall into hell
let him not be proud of his austerities let him not utter a falsehood after he has offered a sacrifice let him not speak ill of brahmanas though he be tormented by them when he has bestowed a gift let him not boast of it
by falsehood a sacrifice becomes vain by selfcomplacency the reward for austerities is lost longevity by speaking evil of brahmanas and the reward of a gift by boasting
giving no pain to any creature let him slowly accumulate spiritual merit for the sake of acquiring a companion to the next world just as the white ant gradually raises its hill
for in the next world neither father nor mother nor wife nor sons nor relations stay to be his companions spiritual merit alone remains with him
single is each being bom single it dies single it enjoys the reward of its virtue single it suffers the punishment of its sin
leaving the dead body on the ground like a log of wood or a clod of earth the relatives depart with averted faces but spiritual merit follows the soul
let him therefore always slowly accumulate spiritual merit in order that it may be his companion after death for with merit as his companion he will traverse a gloom difficult to traverse
that companion speedily conducts the man who is devoted to duty and effaces his sins by austerities to the next world radiant and clothed with an ethereal body
let him who desires to raise his race ever form connexions with the most excellent men and shun all low ones
a brahmana who always connects himself with the most excellent ones and shuns all inferior ones himself becomes most distinguished by an opposite conduct he becomes a sudra
he who is persevering gentle and patient shuns the company of men of cruel conduct and does no injury to living creatures gains if he constantly lives in that manner by controlling his organs and by liberality heavenly bliss
he may accept from any man fuel water roots fruit food offered without asking and honey likewise a gift which consists in a promise of protection
the lord of created beings pragapati has declared that alms freely offered and brought by the giver himself may be accepted even from a sinful man provided the gift had not been asked for or promised beforehand
during fifteen years the manes do not eat the food of that man who disdains a freelyoffered gift nor does the fire carry his offerings to the gods
a couch a house kusa grass perfumes water flowers jewels sour milk grain fish sweet milk meat and vegetables let him not reject if they are voluntarily offered
he who desires to relieve his gurus and those whom he is bound to maintain or wishes to honour the gods and guests may accept gifts from anybody but he must not satisfy his own hunger with such presents
but if his gurus are dead or if he lives separate from them in another house let him when he seeks a subsistence accept presents from good men alone
his labourer in tillage a friend of his family his cowherd his slave and his barber are among sudras those whose food he may eat likewise a poor man who offers himself to be his slave
as his character is as the work is which he desires to perform and as the manner is in which he means to serve even so a voluntary slave must offer himself
he who describes himself to virtuous men in a manner contrary to truth is the most sinful wretch in this world he is a thief who makes away with his own self
all things have their nature determined by speech speech is their root and from speech they proceed but he who is dishonest with respect to speech is dishonest in everything
when he has paid according to the law his debts to the great sages to the manes and to the gods let him make over everything to his son and dwell in his house not caring for any worldly concerns
alone let him constantly meditate in solitude on that which is salutary for his soul for he who meditates in solitude attains supreme bliss
thus have been declared the means by which a brahmana householder must always subsist and the summary of the ordinances for a snataka which cause an increase of holiness and are praiseworthy
a brahmana who being learned in the lore of the vedas conducts himself in this manner and daily destroys his sins will be exalted in brahmans world
the sages having heard the duties of a snataka thus declared spoke to greatsouled bhrigu who sprang from fire
how can death have power over brahmanas who know the sacred science the veda and who fulfil their duties as they have been explained by thee o lord
righteous bhrigu the son of manu thus answered the great sages hear in punishment of what faults death seeks to shorten the lives of brahmanas
through neglect of the vedastudy through deviation from the rule of conduct through remissness in the fulfilment of duties and through faults committed by eating forbidden food death becomes eager to shorten the lives of brahmanas
garlic leeks and onions mushrooms and all plants springing from impure substances are unfit to be eaten by twicebom men
one should carefully avoid red exudations from trees and juices flowing from incisions the selu fruit and the thickened milk of a cow which she gives after calving
rice boiled with sesamum wheat mixed with butter milk and sugar milkrice and flourcakes which are not prepared for a sacrifice meat which has not been sprinkled with water while sacred texts were recited food offered to the gods and sacrificial viands
the milk of a cow or other female animal within ten days after her calving that of camels of onehoofed animals of sheep of a cow in heat or of one that has no calf with her
the milk of all wild animals excepting buffalocows that of women and all substances turned sour must be avoided
among things turned sour sour milk and all food prepared of it may be eaten likewise what is extracted from pure flowers roots and fruit
let him avoid all carnivorous birds and those living in villages and onehoofed animals which are not specially permitted to be eaten and the tittibha parra jacana
the sparrow the plava the hamsa the brahmani duck the villagecock the sarasa crane the raggudala the woodpecker the parrot and the starling
those which feed striking with their beaks webfooted birds the koyashti those which scratch with their toes those which dive and live on fish meat from a slaughterhouse and dried meat
the baka and the balaka crane the raven the khangaritaka animals that eat fish villagepigs and all kinds of fishes
he who eats the flesh of any animal is called the eater of the flesh of that particular creature he who eats fish is an eater of every kind of flesh let him therefore avoid fish
but the fish called pathina and that called rohita may be eaten if used for offerings to the gods or to the manes one may eat likewise ragivas simhatundas and sasalkas on all occasions
let him not eat solitary or unknown beasts and birds though they may fall under the categories of eatable creatures nor any fivetoed animals
the porcupine the hedgehog the iguana the rhinoceros the tortoise and the hare they declare to be eatable likewise those domestic animals that have teeth in one jaw only excepting camels
a twiceborn man who knowingly eats mushrooms a village pig garlic a villagecock onions or leeks will become an outcast
he who unwittingly partakes of any of these six shall perform a samtapana krikkhra or the lunar penance kandrayana of ascetics in case he who has eaten any other kind of forbidden food he shall fast for one day and a night
once a year a brahmana must perform a krikkhra penance in order to atone for unintentionally eating forbidden food but for intentionally eating forbidden food he must perform the penances prescribed specially
beasts and birds recommended for consumption may be slain by brahmanas for sacrifices and in order to feed those whom they are bound to maintain for agastya did this of old
for in ancient times the sacrificial cakes were made of the flesh of eatable beasts and birds at the sacrifices offered by brahmanas and kshatriyas
all lawful hard or soft food may be eaten though stale after having been mixed with fatty substances and so may the remains of sacrificial viands
but all preparations of barley and wheat as well as preparations of milk may be eaten by twicebom men without being mixed with fatty substances though they may have stood for a long time
thus has the food allowed and forbidden to twicebom men been fully described i will now propound the rules for eating and avoiding meat
one may eat meat when it has been sprinkled with water while mantras were recited when brahmanas desire ones doing it when one is engaged in the performance of a rite according to the law and when ones life is in danger
the lord of creatures pragapati created this whole world to be the sustenance of the vital spirit both the immovable and the movable creation is the food of the vital spirit
what is destitute of motion is the food of those endowed with locomotion animals without fangs are the food of those with fangs those without hands of those who possess hands and the timid of the bold
the eater who daily even devours those destined to be his food commits no sin for the creator himself created both the eaters and those who are to be eaten for those special purposes
the consumption of meat is befitting for sacrifices that is declared to be a rule made by the gods but to persist in using it on other occasions is said to be a proceeding worthy of rakshasas
he who eats meat when he honours the gods and manes commits no sin whether he has bought it or himself has killed the animal or has received it as a present from others
a twiceborn man who knows the law must not eat meat except in conformity with the law for if he has eaten it unlawfully he will unable to save himself be eaten after death by his victims
after death the guilt of one who slays deer for gain is not as great as that of him who eats meat for no sacred purpose
but a man who being duly engaged to officiate or to dine at a sacred rite refuses to eat meat becomes after death an animal during twentyone existences
a brahmana must never eat the flesh of animals unhallowed by mantras but obedient to the primeval law he may eat it consecrated with vedic texts
if he has a strong desire for meat he may make an animal of clarified butter or one of flour and eat that but let him never seek to destroy an animal without a lawful reason
as many hairs as the slain beast has so often indeed will he who killed it without a lawful reason suffer a violent death in future births
svayambhu the selfexistent himself created animals for the sake of sacrifices sacrifices have been instituted for the good of this whole world hence the slaughtering of beasts for sacrifices is not slaughtering in the ordinary sense of the word
herbs trees cattle birds and other animals that have been destroyed for sacrifices receive being reborn higher existences
on offering the honeymixture to a guest at a sacrifice and at the rites in honour of the manes but on these occasions only may an animal be slain that rule manu proclaimed
a twiceborn man who knowing the true meaning of the veda slays an animal for these purposes causes both himself and the animal to enter a most blessed state
a twiceborn man of virtuous disposition whether he dwells in his own house with a teacher or in the forest must never even in times of distress cause an injury to any creature which is not sanctioned by the veda
know that the injury to moving creatures and to those destitute of motion which the veda has prescribed for certain occasions is no injury at all for the sacred law shone forth from the veda
he who injures innoxious beings from a wish to give himself pleasure never finds happiness neither living nor dead
he who does not seek to cause the sufferings of bonds and death to living creatures but desires the good of all beings obtains endless bliss
he who does not injure any creature attains without an effort what he thinks of what he undertakes and what he fixes his mind on
meat can never be obtained without injury to living creatures and injury to sentient beings is detrimental to the attainment of heavenly bliss let him therefore shun the use of meat
having well considered the disgusting origin of flesh and the cruelty of fettering and slaying corporeal beings let him entirely abstain from eating flesh
he who disregarding the rule given above does not eat meat like a pisaka becomes dear to men and will not be tormented by diseases
he who permits the slaughter of an animal he who cuts it up he who kills it he who buys or sells meat he who cooks it he who serves it up and he who eats it must all be considered as the slayers of the animal
there is no greater sinner than that man who though not worshipping the gods or the manes seeks to increase the bulk of his own flesh by the flesh of other beings
he who during a hundred years annually offers a horsesacrifice and he who entirely abstains from meat obtain the same reward for their meritorious conduct
by subsisting on pure fruit and roots and by eating food fit for ascetics in the forest one does not gain so great a reward as by entirely avoiding the use of flesh
me he mam sah will devour in the next world whose flesh i eat in this life the wise declare this to be the real meaning of the word flesh mamsah
there is no sin in eating meat in drinking spirituous liquor and in carnal intercourse for that is the natural way of created beings but abstention brings great rewards
will now in due order explain the purification for the dead and the purification of things as they are prescribed for the four castes varna
when a child dies that has teethed or that before teething has received the sacrament of the tonsure kudakarana or of the initiation all relatives become impure and on the birth of a child the same rule is prescribed
it is ordained that among sapindas the impurity on account of a death shall last ten days or until the bones have been collected or three days or one day only
but the sapindarelationship ceases with the seventh person in the ascending and descending lines the samanodakarelationship when the common origin and the existence of a common familyname are no longer known
as this impurity on account of a death is prescribed for all sapindas even so it shall be held on a birth by those who desire to be absolutely pure
or while the impurity on account of a death is common to all sapindas that caused by a birth falls on the parents alone or it shall fall on the mother alone and the father shall become pure by bathing
but a man having spent his strength is purified merely by bathing after begetting a child on a remarried female he shall retain the impurity during three days
those who have touched a corpse are purified after one day and night added to three periods of three days those who give libations of water after three days
a pupil who performs the pitrimedha for his deceased teacher becomes also pure after ten days just like those who carry the corpse out to the burialground
a woman is purified on a miscarriage in as many days and nights as months elapsed after conception and a menstruating female becomes pure by bathing after the menstrual secretion has ceased to flow
on the death of children whose tonsure kudakarman has not been performed the sapindas are declared to become pure in one day and night on the death of those who have received the tonsure but not the initiation the law ordains that the purification takes place after three days
a child that has died before the completion of its second year the relatives shall carry out of the village decked with flowers and bury it in pure ground without collecting the bones afterwards
such a child shall not be burnt with fire and no libations of water shall be offered to it leaving it like a log of wood in the forest the relatives shall remain impure during three days only
the relatives shall not offer libations to a child that has not reached the third year but if it had teeth or the ceremony of naming it namakarman had been performed the offering of water is optional
if a fellow student has died the smriti prescribes an impurity of one day on a birth the purification of the samanodakas is declared to take place after three days and nights
on the death of females betrothed but not married the bridegroom and his relatives are purified after three days and the paternal relatives become pure according to the same rule
let mourners eat food without factitious salt bathe during three days abstain from meat and sleep separate on the ground
the above rule regarding impurity on account of a death has been prescribed for cases where the kinsmen live near the deceased sapinda kinsmen and samanodaka relatives must know the following rule to refer to cases where deceased lived at a distance from them
he who may hear that a relative residing in a distant country has died before ten days after his death have elapsed shall be impure for the remainder of the period of ten days and nights only
if the ten days have passed he shall be impure during three days and nights but if a year has elapsed since the occurrence of the death he becomes pure merely by bathing
a man who hears of a sapinda relatives death or of the birth of a son after the ten days of impurity have passed becomes pure by bathing dressed in his garments
if an infant that has not teethed or a grownup relative who is not a sapinda die in a distant country one becomes at once pure after bathing in ones clothes
if within the ten days of impurity another birth or death happens a brahmana shall remain impure only until the first period of ten days has expired
they declare that when the teacher akarya has died the impurity lasts three days if the teachers son or wife is dead it lasts a day and a night that is a settled rule
for a srotriya who resides with him out of affection a man shall be impure for three days for a maternal uncle a pupil an officiating priest or a maternal relative for one night together with the preceding and following days
if the king in whose realm he resides is dead he shall be impure as long as the light of the sun or stars shines but for an intimate friend who is not a srotriya the impurity lasts for a whole day likewise for a guru who knows the veda and the angas
a brahmana shall be pure after ten days a kshatriya after twelve a vaisya after fifteen and a sudra is purified after a month
let him not unnecessarily lengthen the period of impurity nor interrupt the rites to be performed with the sacred fires for he who performs that agnihotra rite will not be impure though he be a sapinda relative
when he has touched a kandala a menstruating woman an outcast a woman in childbed a corpse or one who has touched a corpse he becomes pure by bathing
he who has purified himself by sipping water shall on seeing any impure thing or person always mutter the sacred texts addressed to surya and the pavamani verses
a brahmana who has touched a human bone to which fat adheres becomes pure by bathing if it be free from fat by sipping water and by touching afterwards a cow or looking at the sun
he who has undertaken the performance of a vow shall not pour out libations to the dead until the vow has been completed but when he has offered water after its completion he becomes pure in three days only
libations of water shall not be offered to those who neglect the prescribed rites and may be said to have been born in vain to those bom in consequence of an illegal mixture of the castes to those who are ascetics of heretical sects and to those who have committed suicide
to women who have joined a heretical sect who through lust live with many men who have caused an abortion have killed their husbands or drink spirituous liquor
a student does not break his vow by carrying out to the place of cremation his own dead teacher akarya subteacher upadhyaya father mother or guru
let him carry out a dead sudra by the southern gate of the town but the corpses of twiceborn men as is proper by the western northern or eastern gates
the taint of impurity does not fall on kings and those engaged in the performance of a vow or of a sattra for the first are seated on the throne of indra and the last two are ever pure like brahman
for a king on the throne of magnanimity immediate purification is prescribed and the reason for that is that he is seated there for the protection of his subjects
the same rule applies to the kinsmen of those who have fallen in a riot or a battle of those who have been killed by lightning or by the king and of those who perished fighting for cows and brahmanas and to those whom the king wishes to be pure
a king is an incarnation of the eight guardian deities of the world the moon the fire the sun the wind indra the lords of wealth and water kubera and varuna and yama
because the king is pervaded by those lords of the world no impurity is ordained for him for purity and impurity of mortals is caused and removed by those lords of the world
by him who is slain in battle with brandished weapons according to the law of the kshatriyas a srauta sacrifice is instantly completed and so is the period of impurity caused by his death that is a settled rule
at the end of the period of impurity a brahmana who has performed the necessary rites becomes pure by touching water a kshatriya by touching the animal on which he rides and his weapons a vaisya by touching his goad or the nosestring of his oxen a sudra by touching his staff
thus the purification required on the death of sapindas has been explained to you o best of twice born men hear now the manner in which men are purified on the death of any relative who is not a sapinda
a brahmana having carried out a dead brahmana who is not a sapinda as if he were a near relative or a near relative of his mother becomes pure after three days
but if he eats the food of the sapindas of the deceased he is purified in ten days but in one day if he does not eat their food nor dwells in their house
having voluntarily followed a corpse whether that of a paternal kinsman or of a stranger he becomes pure by bathing dressed in his clothes by touching fire and eating clarified butter
let him not allow a dead brahmana to be carried out by a sudra while men of the same caste are at hand for that burntoffering which is defiled by a sudra s touch is detrimental to the deceaseds passage to heaven
the knowledge of brahman austerities fire holy food earth restraint of the internal organ water smearing with cowdung the wind sacred rites the sun and time are the purifiers of corporeal beings
among all modes of purification purity in the acquisition of wealth is declared to be the best for he is pure who gains wealth with clean hands not he who purifies himself with earth and water
the learned are purified by a forgiving disposition those who have committed forbidden actions by liberality secret sinners by muttering sacred texts and those who best know the veda by austerities
by earth and water is purified what ought to be made pure a river by its current a woman whose thoughts have been impure by the menstrual secretion a brahmana by abandoning the world samnyasa
the body is cleansed by water the internal organ is purified by truthfulness the individual soul by sacred learning and austerities the intellect by true knowledge
thus the precise rules for the purification of the body have been declared to you hear now the decision of the law regarding the purification of the various inanimate things
the wise ordain that all objects made of metal gems and anything made of stone are to be cleansed with ashes earth and water
a golden vessel which shows no stains becomes pure with water alone likewise what is produced in water as shells and coral what is made of stone and a silver vessel not enchased
from the union of water and fire arose the glittering gold and silver those two therefore are best purified by the elements from which they sprang
copper iron brass pewter tin and lead must be cleansed as may be suitable for each particular case by alkaline substances acids or water
the purification prescribed for all sorts of liquids is by passing two blades of kusa grass through them for solid things by sprinkling them with water for objects made of wood by planing them
at sacrifices the purification of the soma cups called kamasas and grahas and of other sacrificial vessels takes place by rubbing them with the hand and afterwards rinsing them with water
the kaiu and the spoons called sruk and sruva must be cleaned with hot water likewise the wooden sword called sphya the winnowingbasket surpa the cart for bringing the grain the pestle and the mortar
the manner of purifying large quantities of grain and of cloth is to sprinkle them with water but the purification of small quantities is prescribed to take place by washing them

silk and woollen stuffs with alkaline earth blankets with pounded arishta fruit amsupattas with bel fruit linen cloth with a paste of yellow mustard
a man who knows the law must purify conchshells hom bone and ivory like linen cloth or with a mixture of cows urine and water
grass wood and straw become pure by being sprinkled with water a house by sweeping and smearing it with cowdung or whitewash an earthen vessel by a second burning
an earthen vessel which has been defiled by spirituous liquor urine ordure saliva pus or blood cannot be purified by another burning
land is purified by the following five modes viz by sweeping by smearing it with cowdung by sprinkling it with cows urine or milk by scraping and by cows staying on it during a day and night
food which has been pecked at by birds smelt at by cows touched with the foot sneezed on or defiled by hair or insects becomes pure by scattering earth over it
as long as the foul smell does not leave an object defiled by impure substances and the stain caused by them does not disappear so long must earth and water be applied in cleansing inanimate things
the gods declared three things to be pure to brahmanas that on which no taint is visible what has been washed with water and what has been commended as pure by the word of a brahmana
water sufficient in quantity in order to slake the thirst of a cow possessing the proper smell colour and taste and unmixed with impure substances is pure if it is collected on pure ground
the hand of an artisan is always pure so is every vendible commodity exposed for sale in the market and food obtained by begging which a student holds in his hand is always fit for use that is a settled rule
the mouth of a woman is always pure likewise a bird when he causes a fmit to fall a calf is pure on the flowing of the milk and a dog when he catches a deer
manu has declared that the flesh of an animal killed by dogs is pure likewise that of a beast slain by carnivorous animals or by men of low caste dasyu such as kandalas
all those cavities of the body which lie above the navel are pure but those which are below the navel are impure as well as excretions that fall from the body
flies drops of water a shadow a cow a horse the rays of the sun dust earth the wind and fire one must know to be pure to the touch
in order to cleanse the organs by which urine and faeces are ejected earth and water must be used as they may be required likewise in removing the remaining ones among twelve impurities of the body
oily exudations semen blood the fatty substance of the brain urine faeces the mucus of the nose earwax phlegm tears the rheum of the eyes and sweat are the twelve impurities of human bodies
he who desires to be pure must clean the organ by one application of earth the anus by applying earth three times the left hand alone by applying it ten times and both hands by applying it seven times
such is the purification ordained for householders it shall be double for students treble for hermits but quadruple for ascetics
when he has voided urine or faeces let him after sipping water sprinkle the cavities likewise when he is going to recite the veda and always before he takes food
let him who desires bodily purity first sip water three times and then twice wipe his mouth but a woman and a sudra shall perform each act once only
sudras who live according to the law shall each month shave their heads their mode of purification shall be the same as that of vaisyas and their food the fragments of an aryans meal
drops of water from the mouth which do not fall on a limb do not make a man impure nor the hair of the moustache entering the mouth nor what adheres to the teeth
drops which trickle on the feet of him who offers water for sipping to others must be considered as equal to water collected on the ground they render him not impure
he who while carrying anything in any manner is touched by an impure person or thing shall become pure if he performs an ablution without putting down that object
he who has vomited or purged shall bathe and afterwards eat clarified butter but if the attack comes on after he has eaten let him only sip water bathing is prescribed for him who has had intercourse with a woman
though he may be already pure let him sip water after sleeping sneezing eating spitting telling untruths and drinking water likewise when he is going to study the veda
thus the rules of personal purification for men of all castes and those for cleaning inanimate things have been fully declared to you hear now the duties of women
by a girl by a young woman or even by an aged one nothing must be done independently even in her own house
in childhood a female must be subject to her father in youth to her husband when her lord is dead to her sons a woman must never be independent
she must not seek to separate herself from her father husband or sons by leaving them she would make both her own and her husbands families contemptible
she must always be cheerful clever in the management of her household affairs careful in cleaning her utensils and economical in expenditure
him to whom her father may give her or her brother with the fathers permission she shall obey as long as he lives and when he is dead she must not insult his memory
for the sake of procuring good fortune to brides the recitation of benedictory texts svastyayana and the sacrifice to the lord of creatures pragapati are used at weddings but the betrothal by the father or guardian is the cause of the husbands dominion over his wife
the husband who wedded her with sacred texts always gives happiness to his wife both in season and out of season in this world and in the next
though destitute of virtue or seeking pleasure elsewhere or devoid of good qualities yet a husband must be constantly worshipped as a god by a faithful wife
no sacrifice no vow no fast must be performed by women apart from their husbands if a wife obeys her husband she will for that reason alone be exalted in heaven
a faithful wife who desires to dwell after death with her husband must never do anything that might displease him who took her hand whether he be alive or dead
at her pleasure let her emaciate her body by living on pure flowers roots and fruit but she must never even mention the name of another man after her husband has died
until death let her be patient of hardships selfcontrolled and chaste and strive to fulfil that most excellent duty which is prescribed for wives who have one husband only
many thousands of brahmanas who were chaste from their youth have gone to heaven without continuing their race
a virtuous wife who after the death of her husband constantly remains chaste reaches heaven though she have no son just like those chaste men
but a woman who from a desire to have offspring violates her duty towards her deceased husband brings on herself disgrace in this world and loses her place with her husband in heaven
offspring begotten by another man is here not considered lawful nor does offspring begotten on another mans wife belong to the begetter nor is a second husband anywhere prescribed for virtuous women
she who cohabits with a man of higher caste forsaking her own husband who belongs to a lower one will become contemptible in this world and is called a remarried woman parapurva
by violating her duty towards her husband a wife is disgraced in this world after death she enters the womb of a jackal and is tormented by diseases the punishment of her sin
she who controlling her thoughts words and deeds never slights her lord resides after death with her husband in heaven and is called a virtuous wife
in reward of such conduct a female who controls her thoughts speech and actions gains in this life highest renown and in the next world a place near her husband
a twiceborn man versed in the sacred law shall bum a wife of equal caste who conducts herself thus and dies before him with the sacred fires used for the agnihotra and with the sacrificial implements
having thus at the funeral given the sacred fires to his wife who dies before him he may marry again and again kindle the fires
living according to the preceding rules he must never neglect the five great sacrifices and having taken a wife he must dwell in his own house during the second period of his life
a twiceborn snataka who has thus lived according to the law in the order of householders may taking a firm resolution and keeping his organs in subjection dwell in the forest duly observing the rules given below
when a householder sees his skin wrinkled and his hair white and the sons of his sons then he may resort to the forest
abandoning all food raised by cultivation and all his belongings he may depart into the forest either committing his wife to his sons or accompanied by her
taking with him the sacred fire and the implements required for domestic sacrifices he may go forth from the village into the forest and reside there duly controlling his senses
let him offer those five great sacrifices according to the rule with various kinds of pure food fit for ascetics or with herbs roots and fruit
let him wear a skin or a tattered garment let him bathe in the evening or in the morning and let him always wear his hair in braids the hair on his body his beard and his nails being unclipped
let him perform the balioffering with such food as he eats and give alms according to his ability let him honour those who come to his hermitage with alms consisting of water roots and fruit
let him be always industrious in privately reciting the veda let him be patient of hardships friendly towards all of collected mind ever liberal and never a receiver of gifts and compassionate towards all living creatures
let him offer according to the law the agnihotra with three sacred fires never omitting the newmoon and fullmoon sacrifices at the proper time
let him also offer the nakshatreshti the agrayana and the katurmasya sacrifices as well as the turayana and likewise the dakshayana in due order
with pure grains fit for ascetics which grow in spring and in autumn and which he himself has collected let him severally prepare the sacrificial cakes purodasa and the boiled messes karu as the law directs
having offered those most pure sacrificial viands consisting of the produce of the forest he may use the remainder for himself mixed with salt prepared by himself
let him eat vegetables that grow on dry land or in water flowers roots and fruits the productions of pure trees and oils extracted from forestfruits
let him avoid honey flesh and mushrooms growing on the ground or elsewhere the vegetables called bhustrina and sigruka and the sleshmantaka fruit
let him throw away in the month of asvina the food of ascetics which he formerly collected likewise his womout clothes and his vegetables roots and fruit
let him not eat anything grown on ploughed land though it may have been thrown away by somebody nor roots and fruit grown in a village though he may be tormented by hunger
he may eat either what has been cooked with fire or what has been ripened by time he either may use a stone for grinding or his teeth may be his mortar
he may either at once after his daily meal cleanse his vessel for collecting food or lay up a store sufficient for a month or gather what suffices for six months or for a year
having collected food according to his ability he may either eat at night only or in the daytime only or at every fourth mealtime or at every eighth
or he may live according to the rule of the lunar penance kandrayana daily diminishing the quantity of his food in the bright half of the month and increasing it in the dark half or he may eat on the last days of each fortnight once a day only boiled barleygruel
or he may constantly subsist on flowers roots and fruit alone which have been ripened by time and have fallen spontaneously following the rule of the institutes of vikhanas
let him either roll about on the ground or stand during the day on tiptoe or let him alternately stand and sit down going at the savanas at sunrise at midday and at sunset to water in the forest in order to bathe
in summer let him expose himself to the heat of five fires during the rainy season live under the open sky and in winter be dressed in wet clothes thus gradually increasing the rigour of his austerities
when he bathes at the three savanas sunrise midday and sunset let him offer libations of water to the manes and the gods and practising harsher and harsher austerities let him dry up his bodily frame
having reposited the three sacred fires in himself according to the prescribed rule let him live without a fire without a house wholly silent subsisting on roots and fruit
making no effort to procure things that give pleasure chaste sleeping on the bare ground not caring for any shelter dwelling at the roots of trees
from brahmanas who live as ascetics let him receive alms barely sufficient to support life or from other householders of the twicebom castes who reside in the forest
or the hermit who dwells in the forest may bring food from a village receiving it either in a hollow dish of leaves in his naked hand or in a broken earthen dish and may eat eight mouthfuls
these and other observances must a brahmana who dwells in the forest diligently practise and in order to attain complete union with the supreme soul he must study the various sacred texts contained in the upanishads
as well as those rites and texts which have been practised and studied by the sages rishis and by brahmana householders in order to increase their knowledge of brahman and their austerity and in order to sanctify their bodies
or let him walk fully determined and going straight on in a northeasterly direction subsisting on water and air until his body sinks to rest
a brahmana having got rid of his body by one of those modes practised by the great sages is exalted in the world of brahman free from sorrow and fear
but having thus passed the third part of a mans natural term of life in the forest he may live as an ascetic during the fourth part of his existence after abandoning all attachment to worldly objects
he who after passing from order to order after offering sacrifices and subduing his senses becomes tired with giving alms and offerings of food an ascetic gains bliss after death
when he has paid the three debts let him apply his mind to the attainment of final liberation he who seeks it without having paid his debts sinks downwards
having studied the vedas in accordance with the rule having begat sons according to the sacred law and having offered sacrifices according to his ability he may direct his mind to the attainment of final liberation
a twiceborn man who seeks final liberation without having studied the vedas without having begotten sons and without having offered sacrifices sinks downwards
having performed the ishti sacred to the lord of creatures pragapati where he gives all his property as the sacrificial fee having reposited the sacred fires in himself a brahmana may depart from his house as an ascetic
worlds radiant in brilliancy become the portion of him who recites the texts regarding brahman and departs from his house as an ascetic after giving a promise of safety to all created beings
for that twiceborn man by whom not the smallest danger even is caused to created beings there will be no danger from any quarter after he is freed from his body
departing from his house fully provided with the means of purification pavitra let him wander about absolutely silent and caring nothing for enjoyments that may be offered to him
let him always wander alone without any companion in order to attain final liberation fully understanding that the solitary man who neither forsakes nor is forsaken gains his end
he shall neither possess a fire nor a dwelling he may go to a village for his food he shall be indifferent to everything firm of purpose meditating and concentrating his mind on brahman
a potsherd instead of an almsbowl the roots of trees for a dwelling coarse womout garments life in solitude and indifference towards everything are the marks of one who has attained liberation
let him not desire to die let him not desire to live let him wait for his appointed time as a servant waits for the payment of his wages
let him put down his foot purified by his sight let him drink water purified by straining with a cloth let him utter speech purified by truth let him keep his heart pure
let him patiently bear hard words let him not insult anybody and let him not become anybodys enemy for the sake of this perishable body
against an angry man let him not in return show anger let him bless when he is cursed and let him not utter speech devoid of truth scattered at the seven gates
delighting in what refers to the soul sitting in the postures prescribed by the yoga independent of external help entirely abstaining from sensual enjoyments with himself for his only companion he shall live in this world desiring the bliss of final liberation
neither by explaining prodigies and omens nor by skill in astrology and palmistry nor by giving advice and by the exposition of the sastras let him ever seek to obtain alms
let him not in order to beg go near a house filled with hermits brahmanas birds dogs or other mendicants
his hair nails and beard being clipped carrying an almsbowl a staff and a waterpot let him continually wander about controlling himself and not hurting any creature
his vessels shall not be made of metal they shall be free from fractures it is ordained that they shall be cleansed with water like the cups called kamasa at a sacrifice
a gourd a wooden bowl an earthen dish or one made of split cane manu the son of svayambhu has declared to be vessels suitable for an ascetic
let him go to beg once a day let him not be eager to obtain a large quantity of alms for an ascetic who eagerly seeks alms attaches himself also to sensual enjoyments
when no smoke ascends from the kitchen when the pestle lies motionless when the embers have been extinguished when the people have finished their meal when the remnants in the dishes have been removed let the ascetic always go to beg
let him not be sorry when he obtains nothing nor rejoice when he obtains something let him accept so much only as will sustain life let him not care about the quality of his utensils
let him disdain all food obtained in consequence of humble salutations for even an ascetic who has attained final liberation is bound with the fetters of the samsara by accepting food given in consequence of humble salutations
by eating little and by standing and sitting in solitude let him restrain his senses if they are attracted by sensual objects
by the restraint of his senses by the destruction of love and hatred and by the abstention from injuring the creatures he becomes fit for immortality
let him reflect on the transmigrations of men caused by their sinful deeds on their falling into hell and on the torments in the world of yama
on the separation from their dear ones on their union with hated men on their being overpowered by age and being tormented with diseases
on the departure of the individual soul from this body and its new birth in another womb and on its wanderings through ten thousand millions of existences
on the infliction of pain on embodied spirits which is caused by demerit and the gain of eternal bliss which is caused by the attainment of their highest aim gained through spiritual merit
by deep meditation let him recognise the subtile nature of the supreme soul and its presence in all organisms both the highest and the lowest
to whatever order he may be attached let him though blemished by a want of the external marks fulfil his duty equalminded towards all creatures for the external mark of the order is not the cause of the acquisition of merit
though the fruit of the kataka tree the clearingnut makes water clear yet the latter does not become limpid in consequence of the mention of the fruits name
in order to preserve living creatures let him always by day and by night even with pain to his body walk carefully scanning the ground
in order to expiate the death of those creatures which he unintentionally injures by day or by night an ascetic shall bathe and perform six suppressions of the breath
three suppressions of the breath even performed according to the rule and accompanied with the recitation of the vyahritis and of the syllable om one must know to be the highest form of austerity for every brahmana
for as the impurities of metallic ores melted in the blast of a furnace are consumed even so the taints of the organs are destroyed through the suppression of the breath
let him destroy the taints through suppressions of the breath the production of sin by fixed attention all sensual attachments by restraining his senses and organs and all qualities that are not lordly by meditation
let him recognise by the practice of meditation the progress of the individual soul through beings of various kinds a progress hard to understand for unregenerate men
he who possesses the true insight into the nature of the world is not fettered by his deeds but he who is destitute of that insight is drawn into the circle of births and deaths
by not injuring any creatures by detaching the senses from objects of enjoyment by the rites prescribed in the veda and by rigorously practising austerities men gain that state even in this world
let him quit this dwelling composed of the five elements where the bones are the beams which is held together by tendons instead of cords where the flesh and the blood are the mortar
which is thatched with the skin which is foulsmelling filled with urine and ordure infested by old age and sorrow the seat of disease harassed by pain gloomy with passion and perishable
he who leaves this body be it by necessity as a tree that is torn from the riverbank or freely like a bird that quits a tree is freed from the misery of this world dreadful like a shark
making over the merit of his own good actions to his friends and the guilt of his evil deeds to his enemies he attains the eternal brahman by the practice of meditation
when by the disposition of his heart he becomes indifferent to all objects he obtains eternal happiness both in this world and after death
he who has in this manner gradually given up all attachments and is freed from all the pairs of opposites reposes in brahman alone
all that has been declared above depends on meditation for he who is not proficient in the knowledge of that which refers to the soul reaps not the full reward of the performance of rites
let him constantly recite those texts of the veda which refer to the sacrifice those referring to the deities and those which treat of the soul and are contained in the concluding portions of the veda vedanta
that is the refuge of the ignorant and even that the refuse of those who know the meaning of the veda that is the protection of those who seek bliss in heaven and of those who seek endless beatitude
a twiceborn man who becomes an ascetic after the successive performance of the abovementioned acts shakes off sin here below and reaches the highest brahman
thus the law valid for selfrestrained ascetics has been explained to you now listen to the particular duties of those who give up the rites prescribed by the veda
the student the householder the hermit and the ascetic these constitute four separate orders which all spring from the order of householders
but all or even any of these orders assumed successively in accordance with the institutes of the sacred law lead the brahmana who acts by the preceding rules to the highest state
and in accordance with the precepts of the veda and of the smriti the housekeeper is declared to be superior to all of them for he supports the other three
as all rivers both great and small find a restingplace in the ocean even so men of all orders find protection with householders
by twiceborn men belonging to any of these four orders the tenfold law must be ever carefully obeyed
contentment forgiveness selfcontrol abstention from unrighteously appropriating anything obedience to the rules of purification coercion of the organs wisdom knowledge of the supreme soul truthfulness and abstention from anger form the tenfold law
those brahmanas who thoroughly study the tenfold law and after studying obey it enter the highest state
a twiceborn man who with collected mind follows the tenfold law and has paid his three debts may after learning the vedanta according to the prescribed rule become an ascetic
having given up the performance of all rites throwing off the guilt of his sinful acts subduing his organs and having studied the veda he may live at his ease under the protection of his son
he who has thus given up the performance of all rites who is solely intent on his own particular object and free from desires destroys his guilt by his renunciation and obtains the highest state
thus the fourfold holy law of brahmanas which after death yields imperishable rewards has been declared to you now learn the duty of kings
a king desirous of investigating law cases must enter his court of justice preserving a dignified demeanour together with brahmanas and with experienced councillors
there either seated or standing raising his right arm without ostentation in his dress and ornaments let him examine the business of suitors
daily deciding one after another all cases which fall under the eighteen titles of the law according to principles drawn from local usages and from the institutes of the sacred law
of those titles the first is the nonpayment of debts then follow deposit and pledge sale without ownership concerns among partners and resumption of gifts
nonpayment of wages nonperformance of agreements rescission of sale and purchase disputes between the owner of cattle and his servants
disputes regarding boundaries assault and defamation theft robbery and violence adultery
duties of man and wife partition of inheritance gambling and betting these are in this world the eighteen topics which give rise to lawsuits
depending on the eternal law let him decide the suits of men who mostly contend on the titles just mentioned
but if the king does not personally investigate the suits then let him appoint a learned brahmana to try them
that man shall enter that most excellent court accompanied by three assessors and fully consider all causes brought before the king either sitting down or standing
where three brahmanas versed in the vedas and the learned judge appointed by the king sit down they call that the court of fourfaced brahman
but where justice wounded by injustice approaches and the judges do not extract the dart there they also are wounded by that dart of injustice
either the court must not be entered or the truth must be spoken a man who either says nothing or speaks falsely becomes sinful
where justice is destroyed by injustice or truth by falsehood while the judges look on there they shall also be destroyed
justice being violated destroys justice being preserved preserves therefore justice must not be violated lest violated justice destroy us
for divine justice is said to be a bull vrisha that man who violates it kurute lam the gods consider to be a man despicable like a sudra vrishala let him therefore beware of violating justice
the only friend who follows men even after death is justice for everything else is lost at the same time when the body perishes
one quarter of the guilt of an unjust decision falls on him who committed the crime one quarter on the false witness one quarter on all the judges one quarter on the king
but where he who is worthy of condemnation is condemned the king is free from guilt and the judges are saved from sin the guilt falls on the perpetrator of the crime alone
a brahmana who subsists only by the name of his caste gati or one who merely calls himself a brahmana though his origin be uncertain may at the kings pleasure interpret the law to him but never a sudra
the kingdom of that monarch who looks on while a sudra settles the law will sink low like a cow in a morass
that kingdom where sudras are very numerous which is infested by atheists and destitute of twicebom inhabitants soon entirely perishes afflicted by famine and disease
having occupied the seat of justice having covered his body and having worshipped the guardian deities of the world let him with a collected mind begin the trial of causes
knowing what is expedient or inexpedient what is pure justice or injustice let him examine the causes of suitors according to the order of the castes varna
by external signs let him discover the internal disposition of men by their voice their colour their motions their aspect their eyes and their gestures
the internal working of the mind is perceived through the aspect the motions the gait the gestures the speech and the changes in the eye and of the face
the king shall protect the inherited and other property of a minor until he has returned from his teachers house or until he has passed his minority
in like manner care must be taken of barren women of those who have no sons of those whose family is extinct of wives and widows faithful to their lords and of women afflicted with diseases
a righteous king must punish like thieves those relatives who appropriate the property of such females during their lifetime
property the owner of which has disappeared the king shall cause to be kept as a deposit during three years within the period of three years the owner may claim it after that term the king may take it
he who says this belongs to me must be examined according to the rule if he accurately describes the shape and the number of the articles found and so forth he is the owner and ought to receive that property
but if he does not really know the time and the place where it was lost its colour shape and size he is worthy of a fine equal in value to the object claimed
now the king remembering the duty of good men may take onesixth part of property lost and afterwards found or onetenth or at least onetwelfth
property lost and afterwards found by the kings servants shall remain in the keeping of special officials those whom the king may convict of stealing it he shall cause to be slain by an elephant
from that man who shall truly say with respect to treasuretrove this belongs to me the king may take onesixth or onetwelfth part
but he who falsely says so shall be fined in oneeighth of his property or a calculation of the value of the treasure having been made in some smaller portion of that
when a learned brahmana has found treasure deposited in former times he may take even the whole of it for he is master of everything
when the king finds treasure of old concealed in the ground let him give one half to brahmanas and place the other half in his treasury
the king obtains one half of ancient hoards and metals found in the ground by reason of his giving protection and because he is the lord of the soil
property stolen by thieves must be restored by the king to men of all castes varna a king who uses such property for himself incurs the guilt of a thief
a king who knows the sacred law must inquire into the laws of castes gati of districts of guilds and of families and thus settle the peculiar law of each
for men who follow their particular occupations and abide by their particular duty become dear to people though they may live at a distance
neither the king nor any servant of his shall themselves cause a lawsuit to be begun or hush up one that has been brought before them by some other man
as a hunter traces the lair of a wounded deer by the drops of blood even so the king shall discover on which side the right lies by inferences from the facts
when engaged injudicial proceedings he must pay full attention to the truth to the object of the dispute and to himself next to the witnesses to the place to the time and to the aspect
what may have been practised by the virtuous by such twiceborn men as are devoted to the law that he shall establish as law if it be not opposed to the customs of countries families and castes gati
when a creditor sues before the king for the recovery of money from a debtor let him make the debtor pay the sum which the creditor proves to be due
by whatever means a creditor may be able to obtain possession of his property even by those means may he force the debtor and make him pay
by moral suasion by suit of law by artful management or by the customary proceeding a creditor may recover property lent and fifthly by force
a creditor who himself recovers his property from his debtor must not be blamed by the king for retaking what is his own
but him who denies a debt which is proved by good evidence he shall order to pay that debt to the creditor and a small fine according to his circumstances
on the denial of a debt by a debtor who has been required in court to pay it the complainant must call a witness who was present when the loan was made or adduce other evidence
the plaintiff who calls a witness not present at the transaction who retracts his statements or does not perceive that his statements are confused or contradictory
or who having stated what he means to prove afterwards varies his case or who being questioned on a fact duly stated by himself does not abide by it
or who converses with the witnesses in a place improper for such conversation or who declines to answer a question properly put or leaves the court
or who being ordered to speak does not answer or does not prove what he has alleged or who does not know what is the first point and what the second fails in his suit
him also who says d have witnesses and being ordered to produce them produces them not the judge must on these same grounds declare to be nonsuited
if a plaintiff does not speak he may be punished corporally or fined according to the law if a defendant does not plead within three fortnights he has lost his cause
in the double of that sum which a defendant falsely denies or on which the plaintiff falsely declares shall those two men offending against justice be fined by the king
a defendant who being brought into court by the creditor and being questioned denies the debt shall be convicted of his falsehood by at least three witnesses who must depose in the presence of the brahmana appointed by the king
will fully declare what kind of men may be made witnesses in suits by creditors and in what manner those witnesses must give true evidence
householders men with male issue and indigenous inhabitants of the country be they kshatriyas vaisyas or sudras are competent when called by a suitor to give evidence not any persons whatever their condition may be except in cases of urgency
trustworthy men of all the four castes varna may be made witnesses in lawsuits men who know their whole duty and are free from covetousness but let him reject those of an opposite character
those must not be made witnesses who have an interest in the suit nor familiar friends companions and enemies of the parties nor men formerly convicted of perjury nor persons suffering under severe illness nor those tainted by mortal sin
the king cannot be made a witness nor mechanics and actors nor a srotriya nor a student of the veda nor an ascetic who has given up all connexion with the world
nor one wholly dependent nor one of bad fame nor a dasyu nor one who follows forbidden occupations nor an aged man nor an infant nor one man alone nor a man of the lowest castes nor one deficient in organs of sense
nor one extremely grieved nor one intoxicated nor a madman nor one tormented by hunger or thirst nor one oppressed by fatigue nor one tormented by desire nor a wrathful man nor a thief
women should give evidence for women and for twicebom men twiceborn men of the same kind virtuous sudras for sudras and men of the lowest castes for the lowest
but any person whatsoever who has personal knowledge of an act committed in the interior apartments of a house or in a forest or of a crime causing loss of life may give evidence between the parties
on failure of qualified witnesses evidence may given in such cases by a woman by an infant by an aged man by a pupil by a relative by a slave or by a hired servant
but the judge should consider the evidence of infants aged and diseased men who are apt to speak untruly as untrustworthy likewise that of men with disordered minds
in all cases of violence of theft and adultery of defamation and assault he must not examine the competence of witnesses too strictly
on a conflict of the witnesses the king shall accept as true the evidence of the majority if the conflicting parties are equal in number that of those distinguished by good qualities on a difference between equally distinguished witnesses that of the best among the twicebom
evidence in accordance with what has actually been seen or heard is admissible a witness who speaks truth in those cases neither loses spiritual merit nor wealth
a witness who deposes in an assembly of honourable men arya anything else but what he has seen or heard falls after death headlong into hell and loses heaven
when a man originally not appointed to be a witness sees or hears anything and is afterwards examined regarding it he must declare it exactly as he saw or heard it
one man who is free from covetousness may be accepted as witness but not even many pure women because the understanding of females is apt to waver nor even many other men who are tainted with sin
what witnesses declare quite naturally that must be received on trials depositions differing from that which they make improperly are worthless for the purposes of justice
the witnesses being assembled in the court in the presence of the plaintiff and of the defendant let the judge examine them kindly exhorting them in the following manner
what ye know to have been mutually transacted in this matter between the two men before us declare all that in accordance with the truth for ye are witnesses in this cause
a witness who speaks the truth in his evidence gains after death the most excellent regions of bliss and here below unsurpassable fame such testimony is revered by brahman himself
he who gives false evidence is firmly bound by varunas fetters helpless during one hundred existences let men therefore give true evidence
by truthfulness a witness is purified through truthfulness his merit grows truth must therefore be spoken by witnesses of all castes vama
the soul itself is the witness of the soul and the soul is the refuge of the soul despise not thy own soul the supreme witness of men
the wicked indeed say in their hearts nobody sees us but the gods distinctly see them and the male within their own breasts
the sky the earth the waters the male in the heart the moon the sun the fire yama and the wind the night the two twilights and justice know the conduct of all corporeal beings
the judge being purified shall ask in the forenoon the twicebom witnesses who also have been purified and stand facing the north or the east to give true evidence in the presence of images of the gods and of brahmanas
let him examine a brahmana beginning with speak a kshatriya beginning with speak the truth a vaisya admonishing him by mentioning his kine grain and gold a sudra threatening him with the guilt of every crime that causes loss of caste
saying whatever places of torment are assigned by the sages to the slayer of a brahmana to the murderer of women and children to him who betrays a friend and to an ungrateful man those shall be thy portion if thou speakest falsely
the reward of all meritorious deeds which thou good man hast done since thy birth shall become the share of the dogs if in thy speech thou departest from the truth
if thou thinkest o friend of virtue with respect to thyself i am alone know that that sage who witnesses all virtuous acts and all crimes ever resides in thy heart
if thou art not at variance with that divine yama the son of vivasvat who dwells in thy heart thou needest neither visit the ganges nor the land of the kurus
naked and shorn tormented with hunger and thirst and deprived of sight shall the man who gives false evidence go with a potsherd to beg food at the door of his enemy
headlong in utter darkness shall the sinful man tumble into hell who being interrogated in a judicial inquiry answers one question falsely
that man who in a court of justice gives an untrue account of a transaction or asserts a fact of which he was not an eyewitness resembles a blind man who swallows fish with the bones
the gods are acquainted with no better man in this world than him of whom his conscious soul has no distrust when he gives evidence
learn now o friend from an enumeration in due order how many relatives he destroys who gives false evidence in several particular cases
he kills five by false testimony regarding small cattle he kills ten by false testimony regarding kine he kills a hundred by false evidence concerning horses and a thousand by false evidence concerning men
by speaking falsely in a cause regarding gold he kills the bom and the unborn by false evidence concerning land he kills everything beware therefore of false evidence concerning land
they declare false evidence concerning water concerning the carnal enjoyment of women and concerning all gems produced in water or consisting of stones to be equally wicked as a lie concerning land
marking well all the evils which are produced by perjury declare thou openly everything as thou hast heard or seen it
brahmanas who tend cattle who trade who are mechanics actors or singers menial servants or usurers the judge shall treat like sudras
in some cases a man who though knowing the facts to be different gives such false evidence from a pious motive does not lose heaven such evidence they call the speech of the gods
whenever the death of a sudra of a vaisya of a kshatriya or of a brahmana would be caused by a declaration of the truth a falsehood may be spoken for such falsehood is preferable to the truth
such witnesses must offer to sarasvati oblations of boiled rice karu which are sacred to the goddess of speech thus performing the best penance in order to expiate the guilt of that falsehood
or such a witness may offer according to the rule clarified butter in the fire reciting the kushmanda texts or the rik sacred to varuna untie o varuna the uppermost fetter or the three verses addressed to the waters
a man who without being ill does not give evidence in cases of loans and the like within three fortnights after the summons shall become responsible for the whole debt and pay a tenth part of the whole as a fine to the king
the witness to whom within seven days after he has given evidence happens a misfortune through sickness a fire or the death of a relative shall be made to pay the debt and a fine
if two parties dispute about matters for which no witnesses are available and the judge is unable to really ascertain the truth he may cause it to be discovered even by an oath
both by the great sages and the gods oaths have been taken for the purpose of deciding doubtful matters and vasishtha even swore an oath before king sudas the son of pigavana
let no wise man swear an oath falsely even in a trifling matter for he who swears an oath falsely is lost in this world and after death
no crime causing loss of caste is committed by swearing falsely to women the objects of ones desire at marriages for the sake of fodder for a cow or of fuel and in order to show favour to a brahmana
let the judge cause a brahmana to swear by his veracity a kshatriya by his chariot or the animal he rides on and by his weapons a vaisya by his kine grain and gold and a sudra by imprecating on his own head the guilt of all grievous offences pataka
or the judge may cause the party to carry fire or to dive under water or severally to touch the heads of his wives and children
he whom the blazing fire burns not whom the water forces not to come quickly up who meets with no speedy misfortune must be held innocent on the strength of his oath
for formerly when vatsa was accused by his younger brother the fire the spy of the world burned not even a hair of his by reason of his veracity
whenever false evidence has been given in any suit let the judge reverse the judgment and whatever has been done must be considered as undone
evidence given from covetousness distraction terror friendship lust wrath ignorance and childishness is declared to be invalid
will propound in due order the particular punishments for him who gives false evidence from any one of these motives
he who commits perjury through covetousness shall be fined one thousand panas he who does it through distraction in the lowest amercement if a man does it through fear two middling amercements shall be paid as a fine if he does it through friendship four times the amount of the lowest amercement
he who does it through lust shall pay ten times the lowest amercement but he who does it through wrath three times the next or second amercement he who does it through ignorance two full hundreds but he who does it through childishness one hundred panas
they declare that the wise have prescribed these fines for perjury in order to prevent a failure of justice and in order to restrain injustice
but a just king shall fine and banish men of the three lower castes varna who have given false evidence but a brahmana he shall only banish
manu the son of the selfexistent svayambhu has named ten places on which punishment may be made to fall in the cases of the three lower castes varna but a brahmana shall depart unhurt from the country
these are the organ the belly the tongue the two hands and fifthly the two feet the eye the nose the two ears likewise the whole body
let the king having fully ascertained the motive the time and place of the offence and having considered the ability of the criminal to suffer and the nature of the crime cause punishment to fall on those who deserve it
unjust punishment destroys reputation among men and fame after death and causes even in the next world the loss of heaven let him therefore beware of inflicting it
a king who punishes those who do not deserve it and punishes not those who deserve it brings great infamy on himself and after death sinks into hell
let him punish first by gentle admonition afterwards by harsh reproof thirdly by a fine after that by corporal chastisement
but when he cannot restrain such offenders even by corporal punishment then let him apply to them even all the four modes cojointly
those technical names of certain quantities of copper silver and gold which are generally used on earth for the purpose of business transactions among men i will fully declare
the very small mote which is seen when the sun shines through a lattice they declare to be the least of all quantities and to be called a trasarenu a floating particle of dust
know that eight trasarenus are equal in bulk to a liksha the egg of a louse three of those to one grain of black mustard ragasarshapa and three of the latter to a white mustardseed
six grains of white mustard are one middlesized barleycorn and three barleycorns one krishnala raktika or gungaberry five krishnalas are one masha bean and sixteen of those one suvarna
four suvamas are one pala and ten palas one dharana two krishnalas of silver weighed together must be considered one mashaka of silver
sixteen of those make a silver dharana or purana but know that a karsha of copper is a karshapana or pana
know that ten dharanas of silver make one satamana four suvamas must be considered equal in weight to a nishka
two hundred and fifty panas are declared to be the first or lowest amercement five hundred are considered as the mean or middlemost but one thousand as the highest
a debt being admitted as due the defendant shall pay five in the hundred as a fine if it be denied and proved twice as much that is the teaching of manu
a moneylender may stipulate as an increase of his capital for the interest allowed by vasishtha and take monthly the eightieth part of a hundred
or remembering the duty of good men he may take two in the hundred by the month for he who takes two in the hundred becomes not a sinner for gain
just two in the hundred three four and five and not more he may take as monthly interest according to the order of the castes vama
but if a beneficial pledge ie one from which profit accrues has been given he shall receive no interest on the loan nor can he after keeping such a pledge for a very long time give or sell it
a pledge to be kept only must not be used by force the creditor so using it shall give up his whole interest or if it has been spoilt by use he shall satisfy the owner by paying its original price else he commits a theft of the pledge
neither a pledge nor a deposit can be lost by lapse of time they are both recoverable though they have remained long with the bailee
things used with friendly assent a cow a camel a ridinghorse and a beast made over for breaking in are never lost to the owner
but in general whatever chattel an owner sees enjoyed by others during ten years while though present he says nothing that chattel he shall not recover
if the owner is neither an idiot nor a minor and if his chattel is enjoyed by another before his eyes it is lost to him by law the adverse possessor shall retain that property
a pledge a boundary the property of infants an open deposit a sealed deposit women the property of the king and the wealth of a srotriya are not lost in consequence of adverse enjoyment
the fool who uses a pledge without the permission of the owner shall remit half of his interest as a compensation for such use
in money transactions interest paid at one time not by instalments shall never exceed the double of the principal on grain fruit wool or hair and beasts of burden it must not be more than five times the original amount
stipulated interest beyond the legal rate being against the law cannot be recovered they call that a usurious way of lending the lender is in no case entitled to more than five in the hundred
let him not take interest beyond the year nor such as is unapproved nor compound interest periodical interest stipulated interest and corporal interest
he who unable to pay a debt at the fixed time wishes to make a new contract may renew the agreement after paying the interest which is due
if he cannot pay the money due as interest he may insert it in the renewed agreement he must pay as much interest as may be due
he who has made a contract to carry goods by a wheeled carriage for money and has agreed to a certain place or time shall not reap that reward if he does not keep to the place and the time stipulated
whatever rate men fix who are expert in sea voyages and able to calculate the profit according to the place the time and the objects carried that has legal force in such cases with respect to the payment to be made
the man who becomes a surety in this world for the appearance of a debtor and produces him not shall pay the debt out of his own property
but money due by a surety or idly promised or lost at play or due for spirituous liquor or what remains unpaid of a fine and a tax or duty the son of the party owing it shall not be obliged to pay
this just mentioned rule shall apply to the case of a surety for appearance only if a surety for payment should die the judge may compel even his heirs to discharge the debt
on what account then is it that after the death of a surety other than for payment whose affairs are fully known the creditor may in some cases afterwards demand the debt of the heirs
if the surety had received money from him for whom he stood bail and had money enough to pay then the heir of him who received it shall pay the debt out of his property that is the settled rule
a contract made by a person intoxicated or insane or grievously disordered by disease and so forth or wholly dependent by an infant or very aged man or by an unauthorised party is invalid
that agreement which has been made contrary to the law or to the settled usage of the virtuous can have no legal force though it be established by proofs
a fraudulent mortgage or sale a fraudulent gift or acceptance and any transaction where he detects fraud the judge shall declare null and void
if the debtor be dead and the money borrowed was expended for the family it must be paid by the relatives out of their own estate even if they are divided
should even a person wholly dependent make a contract for the behoof of the family the master of the house whether living in his own country or abroad shall not rescind it
what is given by force what is enjoyed by force also what has been caused to be written by force and all other transactions done by force manu has declared void
three suffer for the sake of others witnesses a surety and judges but four enrich themselves through others a brahmana a moneylender a merchant and a king
no king however indigent shall take anything that ought not to be taken nor shall he however wealthy decline taking that which he ought to take be it ever so small
in consequence of his talcing what ought not to be taken or of his refusing what ought to be received a king will be accused of weakness and perish in this world and after death
by taking his due by preventing the confusion of the castes vama and by protecting the weak the power of the king grows and he prospers in this world and after death
let the prince therefore like yama not heeding his own likings and dislikings behave exactly like yama suppressing his anger and controlling himself
but that evilminded king who in his folly decides causes unjustly his enemies soon subjugate
if subduing love and hatred he decides the causes according to the law the hearts of his subjects turn towards him as the rivers run towards the ocean
the debtor who complains to the king that his creditor recovers the debt independently of the court shall be compelled by the king to pay as a fine one quarter of the sum and to his creditor the money due
even by personal labour shall the debtor make good what he owes to his creditor if he be of the same caste or of a lower one but a debtor of a higher caste shall pay it gradually when he earns something
according to these rules let the king equitably decide between men who dispute with each other the matters which are proved by witnesses and other evidence
a sensible man should make a deposit only with a person of good family of good conduct well acquainted with the law veracious having many relatives wealthy and honourable arya
in whatever manner a person shall deposit anything in the hands of another in the same manner ought the same thing to be received back by the owner as the delivery was so must be the redelivery
he who restores not his deposit to the depositor at his request may be tried by the judge in the depositors absence
on failure of witnesses let the judge actually deposit gold with that defendant under some pretext or other through spies of suitable age and appearance and afterwards demand it back
if the defendant restores it in the manner and shape in which it was bailed there is nothing of that description in his hands for which others accuse him
but if he restores not that gold as be ought to those spies then he shall be compelled by force to restore both deposits that is a settled rule of law
an open or a sealed deposit must never be returned to a near relative of the depositor during the latters lifetime for if the recipient dies without delivering them they are lost but if he does not die they are not lost
but a depositary who of his own accord returns them to a near relative of a deceased depositor must not be harassed about them by the king or by the depositors relatives
and in doubtful cases he should try to obtain that object by friendly means without having recourse to artifice or having inquired into depositarys conduct he should settle the matter with gentle means
such is the rule for obtaining back all those open deposits in the case of a sealed deposit the depositary shall incur no censure unless he has taken out something
a deposit which has been stolen by thieves or washed away by water or burned by fire the bailee shall not make it good unless he took part of it for himself
him who appropriates a deposit and him who asks for it without having made it the judge shall try by all sorts of means and by the oaths prescribed in the veda
he who does not return a deposit and he who demands what he never bailed shall both be punished like thieves or be compelled to pay a fine equal to the value of the object retained or claimed
the king should compel him who does not restore an open deposit and in like manner him who retains a sealed deposit to pay a fine equal to its value
that man who by false pretences may possess himself of anothers property shall be publicly punished by various modes of corporal or capital chastisement together with his accomplices
if a deposit of a particular description or quantity is bailed by anybody in the presence of a number of witnesses it must be known to be of that particular description and quantity the depositary who makes a false statement regarding it is liable to a fine
but if anything is delivered or received privately it must be privately returned as the bailment was so should be the redelivery
thus let the king decide causes concerning a deposit and a friendly loan for use without showing undue rigour to the depositary
if anybody sells the property of another man without being the owner and without the assent of the owner the judge shall not admit him who is a thief though he may not consider himself as a thief as a witness in any case
if the offender is a kinsman of the owner he shall be fined six hundred panas if he is not a kinsman nor has any excuse he shall be guilty of theft
a gift or sale made by anybody else but the owner must be considered as null and void according to the rule injudicial proceedings
where possession is evident but no title is perceived there the title shall be a proof of ownership not possession such is the settled rule
he who obtains a chattel in the market before a number of witnesses acquires that chattel with a clear legal title by purchase
if the original seller be not producible the buyer being exculpated by a public sale must be dismissed by the king without punishment but the former owner who lost the chattel shall receive it back from the buyer
one commodity mixed with another must not be sold as pure nor a bad one as good nor less than the proper quantity or weight nor anything that is not at hand or that is concealed
if after one damsel has been shown another be given to the bridegroom he may marry them both for the same price that manu ordained
he who gives a damsel in marriage having first openly declared her blemishes whether she be insane or afflicted with leprosy or have lost her virginity is not liable to punishment
if an officiating priest chosen to perform a sacrifice abandons his work a share only of the fee in proportion to the work done shall be given to him by those who work with him
but he who abandons his work after the sacrificial fees have been given shall obtain his full share and cause to be performed what remains by another priest
but if specific fees are ordained for the several parts of a rite shall he who performs the part receive them or shall they all share them
the adhvaryu priest shall take the chariot and the brahman at the kindling of the fires agnyadhana a horse the hotri priest shall also take a horse and the udgatri the cart used when the soma is purchased
the four chief priests among all the sixteen who are entitled to one half shall receive a moiety of the fee the next four one half of that the set entitled to a third share one third and those entitled to a fourth a quarter
by the application of these principles the allotment of shares must be made among those men who here below perform their work conjointly
should money be given or promised for a pious purpose by one man to another who asks for it the gift shall be void if the money is afterwards not used in the manner stated
but if the recipient through pride or greed tries to enforce the fulfilment of the promise he shall be compelled by the king to pay one suvama as an expiation for his theft
thus the lawful subtraction of a gift has been fully explained i will next propound the law for the non payment of wages
a hired servant or workman who without being ill out of pride fails to perform his work according to the agreement shall be fined eight krishnalas and no wages shall be paid to him
but if he is really ill and after recovery performs his work according to the original agreement he shall receive his wages even after the lapse of a very long time
but if he whether sick or well does not perform or cause to be performed by others his work according to his agreement the wages for that work shall not be given to him even if it be only slightly incomplete
thus the law for the nonpayment of wages has been completely stated i will next explain the law concerning men who break an agreement
if a man belonging to a corporation inhabiting a village or a district after swearing to an agreement breaks it through avarice the king shall banish him from his realm
and having imprisoned such a breaker of an agreement he shall compel him to pay six nishkas each of four suvamas and one satamana of silver
a righteous king shall apply this law of fines in villages and castes gati to those who break an agreement
if anybody in this world after buying or selling anything repent of his bargain he may return or take back that chattel within ten days
but after the lapse of ten days he may neither give nor cause it to be given back both he who takes it back and he who gives it back except by consent shall be fined by the king six hundred panas
but the king himself shall impose a fine of ninetysix panas on him who gives a blemished damsel to a suitor without informing him of the blemish
but that man who out of malice says of a maiden she is not a maiden shall be fined one hundred panas if he cannot prove her blemish
the nuptial texts are applied solely to virgins and nowhere among men to females who have lost their virginity for such females are excluded from religious ceremonies
the nuptial texts are a certain proof that a maiden has been made a lawful wife but the learned should know that they and the marriage ceremony are complete with the seventh step of the bride around the sacred fire
if anybody in this world repent of any completed transaction the king shall keep him on the road of rectitude in accordance with the rules given above
will fully declare in accordance with the true law the rules concerning the disputes arising from the transgressions of owners of cattle and of herdsmen
during the day the responsibility for the safety of the cattle rests on the herdsman during the night on the owner provided they are in his house if it be otherwise the herdsman will be responsible for them also during the night
a hired herdsman who is paid with milk may milk with the consent of the owner the best cow out of ten such shall be his hire if no other wages are paid
the herdsman alone shall make good the loss of a beast strayed destroyed by worms killed by dogs or by falling into a pit if he did not duly exert himself to prevent it
but for an animal stolen by thieves though he raised an alarm the herdsman shall not pay provided he gives notice to his master at the proper place and time
if cattle die let him carry to his master their ears skin tails bladders tendons and the yellow concrete bile and let him point out their particular marks
but if goats or sheep are surrounded by wolves and the herdsman does not hasten to their assistance lie shall be responsible for any animal which a wolf may attack and kill
but if they kept in proper order graze together in the forest and a wolf suddenly jumping on one of them kills it the herdsman shall bear in that case no responsibility
on all sides of a village a space one hundred dhanus or three samyathrows in breadth shall be reserved for pasture and thrice that space round a town
if the cattle do damage to unfenced crops on that common the king shall in that case not punish the herdsmen
the owner of the field shall make there a hedge over which a camel cannot look and stop every gap through which a dog or a boar can thrust his head
if cattle do mischief in an enclosed field near a highway or near a village the herdsman shall be fined one hundred panas but cattle unattended by a herdsman the watchman in the field shall drive away
for damage in other fields each head of cattle shall pay a fine of one pana and a quarter and in all cases the value of the crop destroyed shall be made good to the owner of the field that is the settled rule
but manu has declared that no fine shall be paid for damage done by a cow within ten days after her calving by bulls and by cattle sacred to the gods whether they are attended by a herdsman or not
if the crops are destroyed by the husbandmans own fault the fine shall amount to ten times as much as the kings share but the fine shall be only half that amount if the fault lay with the servants and the farmer had no knowledge of it
to these rules a righteous king shall keep in all cases of transgressions by masters their cattle and herdsmen
if a dispute has arisen between two villages concerning a boundary the king shall settle the limits in the month of gyaishtha when the landmarks are most distinctly visible
let him mark the boundaries by trees eg nyagrodhas asvatthas kimsukas cottontrees salas palmyra palms and trees with milky juice
by clustering shrubs bamboos of different kinds samis creepers and raised mounds reeds thickets of kubgaka thus the boundary will not be forgotten
tanks wells cisterns and fountains should be built where boundaries meet as well as temples
and as he will see that through mens ignorance of the boundaries trespasses constantly occur in the world let him cause to be made other hidden marks for boundaries
stones bones cows hair chaff ashes potsherds dry cowdung bricks cinders pebbles and sand
and whatever other things of a similar kind the earth does not corrode even after a long time those he should cause to be buried where one boundary joins the other
by these signs by long continued possession and by constantly flowing streams of water the king shall ascertain the boundary of the land of two disputing parties
if there be a doubt even on inspection of the marks the settlement of a dispute regarding boundaries shall depend on witnesses
the witnesses giving evidence regarding a boundary shall be examined concerning the landmarks in the presence of the crowd of the villagers and also of the two litigants
as they being questioned unanimously decide even so he shall record the boundary in writing together with their names
let them putting earth on their heads wearing chaplets of red flowers and red dresses being sworn each by the rewards for his meritorious deeds settle the boundary in accordance with the truth
if they determine the boundary in the manner stated they are guiltless being veracious witnesses but if they determine it unjustly they shall be compelled to pay a fine of two hundred panas
on failure of witnesses from the two villages men of the four neighbouring villages who are pure shall make as witnesses a decision concerning the boundary in the presence of the king
on failure of neighbours who are original inhabitants of the country and can be witnesses with respect to the boundary the king may hear the evidence even of the following inhabitants of the forest
viz hunters fowlers herdsmen fishermen rootdiggers snakecatchers gleaners and other foresters
as they being examined declare the marks for the meeting of the boundaries to be even so the king shall justly cause them to be fixed between the two villages
the decision concerning the boundarymarks of fields wells tanks of gardens and houses depends upon the evidence of the neighbours
should the neighbours give false evidence when men dispute about a boundarymark the king shall make each of them pay the middlemost amercement as a fine
he who by intimidation possesses himself of a house a tank a garden or a field shall be fined five hundred panas if he trespassed through ignorance the fine shall be two hundred panas
if the boundary cannot be ascertained by any evidence let a righteous king with the intention of benefiting them all himself assign his land to each that is the settled rule
thus the law for deciding boundary disputes has been fully declared i will next propound the manner of deciding cases of defamation
a kshatriya having defamed a brahmana shall be fined one hundred panas a vaisya one hundred and fifty or two hundred a sudra shall suffer corporal punishment
a brahmana shall be fined fifty panas for defaming a kshatriya in the case of a vaisya the fine shall be twentyfive panas in the case of a sudra twelve
for offences of twicebom men against those of equal caste vama the fine shall be also twelve panas for speeches which ought not to be uttered that and every fine shall be double
a oncebom man a sudra who insults a twiceborn man with gross invective shall have his tongue cut out for he is of low origin
if he mentions the names and castes gati of the twicebom with contumely an iron nail ten fingers long shall be thrust redhot into his mouth
if he arrogantly teaches brahmanas their duty the king shall cause hot oil to be poured into his mouth and into his ears
he who through arrogance makes false statements regarding the learning of a castefellow his country his caste gati or the rites by which his body was sanctified shall be compelled to pay a fine of two hundred panas
he who even in accordance with the true facts contemptuously calls another man oneeyed lame or the like names shall be fined at least one karshapana
he who defames his mother his father his wife his brother his son or his teacher and he who gives not the way to his preceptor shall be compelled to pay one hundred panas
for mutual abuse by a brahmana and a kshatriya a fine must be imposed by a discerning king on the brahmana the lowest amercement but on the kshatriya the middlemost
a vaisya and a sudra must be punished exactly in the same manner according to their respective castes but the tongue of the sudra shall not be cut out that is the decision
thus the rules for punishments applicable to cases of defamation have been truly declared i will next propound the decision of cases of assault
with whatever limb a man of a low caste does hurt to a man of the three highest castes even that limb shall be cut off that is the teaching of manu
he who raises his hand or a stick shall have his hand cut off he who in anger kicks with his foot shall have his foot cut off
a lowcaste man who tries to place himself on the same seat with a man of a high caste shall be branded on his hip and be banished or the king shall cause his buttock to be gashed
if out of arrogance he spits on a superior the king shall cause both his lips to be cut off if he urines on him the penis if he breaks wind against him the anus
if he lays hold of the hair of a superior let the king unhesitatingly cut off his hands likewise if he takes him by the feet the beard the neck or the scrotum
he who breaks the skin of an equal or fetches blood from him shall be fined one hundred panas he who cuts a muscle six nishkas he who breaks a bone shall be banished
according to the usefulness of the several kinds of trees a fine must be inflicted for injuring them that is the settled rule
if a blow is struck against men or animals in order to give them pain the judge shall inflict a fine in proportion to the amount of pain caused
if a limb is injured a wound is caused or blood flows the assailant shall be made to pay to the sufferer the expenses of the cure or the whole both the usual amercement and the expenses of the cure as a fine to the king
he who damages the goods of another be it intentionally or unintentionally shall give satisfaction to the owner and pay to the king a fine equal to the damage
in the case of damage done to leather or to utensils of leather of wood or of clay the fine shall be five times their value likewise in the case of damage to flowers roots and fruit
they declare with respect to a carriage its driver and its owner that there are ten cases in which no punishment for damage done can be inflicted in other cases a fine is prescribed
when the nosestring is snapped when the yoke is broken when the carriage turns sideways or back when the axle or a wheel is broken
when the leatherthongs the rope around the neck or the bridle are broken and when the driver has loudly called out make waymanu has declared that in all these cases no punishment shall be inflicted
but if the cart turns off the road through the drivers want of skill the owner shall be fined if damage is done two hundred panas
if the driver is skilful but negligent he alone shall be fined if the driver is unskilful the occupants of the carriage also shall be each fined one hundred panas
but if he is stopped on his way by cattle or by another carriage and he causes the death of any living being a fine shall without doubt be imposed
if a man is killed his guilt will be at once the same as that of a thief for large animals such as cows elephants camels or horses half of that
for injuring small cattle the fine shall be two hundred panas the fine for beautiful wild quadrupeds and birds shall amount to fifty panas
for donkeys sheep and goats the fine shall be five mashas but the punishment for killing a dog or a pig shall be one masha
a wife a son a slave a pupil and a younger brother of the full blood who have committed faults may be beaten with a rope or a split bamboo
but on the back part of the body only never on a noble part he who strikes them otherwise will incur the same guilt as a thief
thus the whole law of assault and hurt has been declared completely i will now explain the rules for the decision in cases of theft
let the king exert himself to the utmost to punish thieves for if he punishes thieves his fame grows and his kingdom prospers
that king indeed is ever worthy of honour who ensures the safety of his subjects for the sacrificial session sattra which he as it were performs thereby ever grows in length the safety of his subjects representing the sacrificial fee
a king who duly protects his subjects receives from each and all the sixth part of their spiritual merit if he does not protect them the sixth part of their demerit also will fall on him
whatever merit a man gains by reading the veda by sacrificing by charitable gifts or by worshipping gurus and gods the king obtains a sixth part of that in consequence of his duly protecting his kingdom
a king who protects the created beings in accordance with the sacred law and smites those worthy of corporal punishment daily offers as it were sacrifices at which hundred thousands are given as fees
a king who does not afford protection yet takes his share in kind his taxes tolls and duties daily presents and fines will after death soon sink into hell
they declare that a king who affords no protection yet receives the sixth part of the produce takes upon himself all the foulness of his whole people
know that a king who heeds not the rules of the law who is an atheist and rapacious who does not protect his subjects but devours them will sink low after death
let him carefully restrain the wicked by three methods by imprisonment by putting them in fetters and by various kinds of corporal punishments
for by punishing the wicked and by favouring the virtuous kings are constantly sanctified just as twice born men by sacrifices
a king who desires his own welfare must always forgive litigants infants aged and sick men who inveigh against him
he who being abused by men in pain pardons them will in reward of that act be exalted in heaven but he who proud of his kingly state forgives them not will for that reason sink into hell
a thief shall running approach the king with flying hair confessing that theft and saying thus have i done punish me
and he must carry on his shoulder a pestle or a club of khadira wood or a spear sharp at both ends or an iron staff
whether he be punished or pardoned the thief is freed from the guilt of theft but the king if he punishes not takes upon himself the guilt of the thief
the killer of a learned brahmana throws his guilt on him who eats his food an adulterous wife on her negligent husband a sinning pupil or sacrificer on their negligent teacher or priest a thief on the king who pardons him
but men who have committed crimes and have been punished by the king go to heaven being pure like those who performed meritorious deeds
he who steals the rope or the waterpot from a well or damages a hut where water is distributed shall pay one masha as a fine and restore the article abstracted or damaged in its proper place
on him who steals more than ten kumbhas of grain corporal punishment shall be inflicted in other cases he shall be fined eleven times as much and shall pay to the owner the value of his property
so shall corporal punishment be inflicted for stealing more than a hundred palas of articles sold by the weight ie of gold silver and so forth and of most excellent clothes
for stealing more than fifty palas it is enacted that the hands of the offender shall be cut off but in other cases let him inflict a fine of eleven times the value
for stealing men of noble family and especially women and the most precious gems the offender deserves corporal or capital punishment
for stealing large animals weapons or medicines let the king fix a punishment after considering the time and the purpose for which they were destined
for stealing cows belonging to brahmanas piercing the nostrils of a barren cow and for stealing other cattle belonging to brahmanas the offender shall forthwith lose half his feet
for stealing thread cotton drugs causing fermentation cowdung molasses sour milk sweet milk butter milk water or grass
vessels made of bamboo or other cane salt of various kinds earthen vessels earth and ashes
fish birds oil clarified butter meat honey and other things that come from beasts
or other things of a similar kind spirituous liquor boiled rice and every kind of cooked food the fine shall be twice the value of the stolen article
for flowers green com shrubs creepers trees and other unhusked grain the fine shall be five krishnalas
for husked grain vegetables roots and fruit the fine shall be one hundred panas if there is no connexion between the owner and the thief fifty panas if such a connexion exists
an offence of this description which is committed in the presence of the owner and with violence will be robbery if it is committed in his absence it will be theft likewise if the possession of anything is denied after it has been taken
on that man who may steal any of the abovementioned articles when they are prepared for use let the king inflict the first or lowest amercement likewise on him who may steal a sacred fire out of the room in which it is kept
with whatever limb a thief in any way commits an offence against men even of that the king shall deprive him in order to prevent a repetition of the crime
neither a father nor a teacher nor a friend nor a mother nor a wife nor a son nor a domestic priest must be left unpunished by a king if they do not keep within their duty
where another common man would be fined one karshapana the king shall be fined one thousand that is the settled rule
in a case of theft the guilt of a sudra shall be eightfold that of a vaisya sixteenfold that of a kshatriya twoandthirtyfold
that of a brahmana sixtyfourfold or quite a hundredfold or even twice fourandsixtyfold each of them knowing the nature of the offence
the taking of roots and of fruit from trees of wood for a sacrificial fire and of grass for feeding cows manu has declared to be no theft
a brahmana seeking to obtain property from a man who took what was not given to him either by sacrificing for him or by teaching him is even like a thief
a twiceborn man who is travelling and whose provisions are exhausted shall not be fined if he takes two stalks of sugarcane or two esculent roots from the field of another man
he who ties up unbound or sets free tied up cattle of other men he who takes a slave a horse or a carriage will have incurred the guilt of a thief
a king who punishes thieves according to these rules will gain fame in this world and after death unsurpassable bliss
a king who desires to gain the throne of indra and imperishable eternal fame shall not even for a moment neglect to punish the man who commits violence
he who commits violence must be considered as the worst offender more wicked than a defamer than a thief and than he who injures another with a staff
but that king who pardons the perpetrator of violence quickly perishes and incurs hatred
neither for friendships sake nor for the sake of great lucre must a king let go perpetrators of violence who cause terror to all creatures
twicebom men may take up arms when they are hindered in the fulfilment of their duties when destruction threatens the twiceborn castes vama in evil times
in their own defence in a strife for the fees of officiating priests and in order to protect women and brahmanas he who under such circumstances kills in the cause of right commits no sin
one may slay without hesitation an assassin who approaches with murderous intent whether he be ones teacher a child or an aged man or a brahmana deeply versed in the vedas
by killing an assassin the slayer incurs no guilt whether he does it publicly or secretly in that case fury recoils upon fury
men who commit adultery with the wives of others the king shall cause to be marked by punishments which cause terror and afterwards banish
for by adultery is caused a mixture of the castes vama among men thence follows sin which cuts up even the roots and causes the destruction of everything
a man formerly accused of such offences who secretly converses with another mans wife shall pay the first or lowest amercement
but a man not before accused who thus speaks with a woman for some reasonable cause shall not incur any guilt since in him there is no transgression
he who addresses the wife of another man at a tirtha outside the village in a forest or at the confluence of rivers suffer the punishment for adulterous acts samgrahana
offering presents to a woman romping with her touching her ornaments and dress sitting with her on a bed all these acts are considered adulterous acts samgrahana
if one touches a woman in a place which ought not to be touched or allows oneself to be touched in such a spot all such acts done with mutual consent are declared to be adulterous samgrahana
a man who is not a brahmana ought to suffer death for adultery samgrahana for the wives of all the four castes even must always be carefully guarded
mendicants bards men who have performed the initiatory ceremony of a vedic sacrifice and artisans are not prohibited from speaking to married women
let no man converse with the wives of others after he has been forbidden to do so but he who converses with them in spite of a prohibition shall be fined one suvarna
this rule does not apply to the wives of actors and singers nor of those who live on the intrigues of their own wives for such men send their wives to others or concealing themselves allow them to hold criminal intercourse
yet he who secretly converses with such women or with female slaves kept by one master and with female ascetics shall be compelled to pay a small fine
he who violates an unwilling maiden shall instantly suffer corporal punishment but a man who enjoys a willing maiden shall not suffer corporal punishment if his caste be the same as hers
from a maiden who makes advances to a man of high caste he shall not take any fine but her who courts a man of low caste let him force to live confined in her house
a man of low caste who makes love to a maiden of the highest caste shall suffer corporal punishment he who addresses a maiden on equal caste shall pay the nuptial fee if her father desires it
but if any man through insolence forcibly contaminates a maiden two of his fingers shall be instantly cut off and he shall pay a fine of six hundred panas
a man of equal caste who defiles a willing maiden shall not suffer the amputation of his fingers but shall pay a fine of two hundred panas in order to deter him from a repetition of the offence
a damsel who pollutes another damsel must be fined two hundred panas pay the double of her nuptial fee and receive ten lashes with a rod
but a woman who pollutes a damsel shall instantly have her head shaved or two fingers cut off and be made to ride through the town on a donkey
if a wife proud of the greatness of her relatives or her own excellence violates the duty which she owes to her lord the king shall cause her to be devoured by dogs in a place frequented by many
let him cause the male offender to be burnt on a redhot iron bed they shall put logs under it until the sinner is burned to death
on a man once convicted who is again accused within a year a double fine must be inflicted even thus must the fine be doubled for repeated intercourse with a vratya and a kandali
a sudra who has intercourse with a woman of a twicebom caste varna guarded or unguarded shall be punished in the following manner if she was unguarded he loses the part offending and all his property if she was guarded everything even his life
for intercourse with a guarded brahmana a vaisya shall forfeit all his property after imprisonment for a year a kshatriya shall be fined one thousand panas and be shaved with the urine of an ass
if a vaisya or a kshatriya has connexion with an unguarded brahmana let him fine the vaisya five hundred panas and the kshatriya one thousand
but even these two if they offend with a brahmani not only guarded but the wife of an eminent man shall be punished like a sudra or be burnt in a fire of dry grass
a brahmana who carnally knows a guarded brahmani against her will shall be fined one thousand panas but he shall be made to pay five hundred if he had connexion with a willing one
tonsure of the head is ordained for a brahmana instead of capital punishment but men of other castes shall suffer capital punishment
let him never slay a brahmana though he have committed all possible crimes let him banish such an offender leaving all his property to him and his body unhurt
no greater crime is known on earth than slaying a brahmana a king therefore must not even conceive in his mind the thought of killing a brahmana
if a vaisya approaches a guarded female of the kshatriya caste or a kshatriya a guarded vaisya woman they both deserve the same punishment as in the case of an unguarded brahmana female
a brahmana shall be compelled to pay a fine of one thousand panas if he has intercourse with guarded females of those two castes for offending with a guarded sudra female a fine of one thousand panas shall be inflicted on a kshatriya or a vaisya
for intercourse with an unguarded kshatriya a fine of five hundred panas shall fall on a vaisya but for the same offence a kshatriya shall be shaved with the urine of a donkey or pay the same fine
a brahmana who approaches unguarded females of the kshatriya or vaisya castes or a sudra female shall be fined five hundred panas but for intercourse with a female of the lowest castes one thousand
that king in whose town lives no thief no adulterer no defamer no man guilty of violence and no committer of assaults attains the world of sakra indra
the suppression of those five in his dominions secures to a king paramount sovereignty among his peers and fame in the world
a sacrificer who forsakes an officiating priest and an officiating priest who forsakes a sacrifices each being able to perform his work and not contaminated by grievous crimes must each be fined one hundred panas
neither a mother nor a father nor a wife nor a son shall be cast off he who casts them off unless guilty of a crime causing loss of caste shall be fined six hundred panas
if twicebom men dispute among each other concerning the duty of the orders a king who desires his own welfare should not hastily decide what is the law
having shown them due honor he should with the assistance of brahmanas first soothe them by gentle speech and afterwards teach them their duty
a brahmana who does not invite his next neighbour and his neighbour next but one though both he worthy of the honour to a festival at which twenty brahmanas are entertained is liable to a fine of one masha
a srotriya who does not entertain a virtuous srotriya at auspicious festive rites shall be made to pay him twice the value of the meal and a masha of gold as a fine to the king
a blind man an idiot a cripple who moves with the help of a board a man full seventy years old and he who confers benefits on srotriyas shall not be compelled by any king to pay a tax
let the king always treat kindly a srotriya a sick or distressed man an infant and an aged or indigent man a man of high birth and an honourable man arya
a washerman shall wash the clothes of his employers gently on a smooth board of salmaliwood he shall not return the clothes of one person for those of another nor allow anybody but the owner to wear them
a weaver who has received ten palas of thread shall return cloth weighing one pala more he who acts differently shall be compelled to pay a fine of twelve panas
let the king take onetwentieth of that amount which men well acquainted with the settlement of tolls and duties and skilful in estimating the value of all kinds of merchandise may fix as the value for each saleable commodity
let the king confiscate the whole property of a trader who out of greed exports goods of which the king has a monopoly or the export of which is forbidden
he who avoids a customhouse or a toll he who buys or sells at an improper time or he who makes a false statement in enumerating his goods shall be fined eight times the amount of duty which he tried to evade
let the king fix the rates for the purchase and sale of all marketable goods having duly considered whence they come whither they go how long they have been kept the probable profit and the probable outlay
once in five nights or at the close of each fortnight let the king publicly settle the prices for the merchants
all weights and measures must be duly marked and once in six months let him reexamine them
at a ferry an empty cart shall be made to pay one pana a mans load half a pana an animal and a woman one quarter of a pana an unloaded man onehalf of a quarter
carts laden with vessels full of merchandise shall be made to pay toll at a ferry according to the value of the goods empty vessels and men without luggage some trifle
for a long passage the boathire must be proportioned to the places and times know that this rule refers to passages along the banks of rivers at sea there is no settled freight
but a woman who has been pregnant two months or more an ascetic a hermit in the forest and brahmanas who are students of the veda shall not be made to pay toll at a ferry
whatever may be damaged in a boat by the fault of the boatmen that shall be made good by the boatmen collectively each paying his share
this decision in suits brought by passengers holds good only in case the boatmen are culpably negligent on the water in the case of an accident caused by the will of the gods no fine can be inflicted on them
the king should order a vaisya to trade to lend money to cultivate the land or to tend cattle and a sudra to serve the twicebom castes
some wealthy brahmana shall compassionately support both a kshatriya and a vaisya if they are distressed for a livelihood employing them on work which is suitable for their castes
but a brahmana who because he is powerful out of greed makes initiated men of the twicebom castes against their will do the work of slaves shall be fined by the king six hundred panas
but a sudra whether bought or unbought he may compel to do servile work for he was created by the selfexistent svayambhu to be the slave of a brahmana
a sudra though emancipated by his master is not released from servitude since that is innate in him who can set him free from it
there are slaves of seven kinds viz he who is made a captive under a standard he who serves for his daily food he who is born in the house he who is bought and he who is given he who is inherited from ancestors and he who is enslaved by way of punishment
a wife a son and a slave these three are declared to have no property the wealth which they earn is acquired for him to whom they belong
a brahmana may confidently seize the goods of his sudra slave for as that slave can have no property his master may take his possessions
the king should carefully compel vaisyas and sudra to perform the work prescribed for them for if these two castes swerved from their duties they would throw this whole world into confusion
let him daily look after the completion of his undertakings his beasts of burden and carriages the collection of his revenues and the disbursements his mines and his treasury
a king who thus brings to a conclusion all the legal business enumerated above and removes all sin reaches the highest state of bliss
will now propound the eternal laws for a husband and his wife who keep to the path of duty whether they be united or separated
day and night woman must be kept in dependence by the males of their families and if they attach themselves to sensual enjoyments they must be kept under ones control
her father protects her in childhood her husband protects her in youth and her sons protect her in old age a woman is never fit for independence
reprehensible is the father who gives not his daughter in marriage at the proper time reprehensible is the husband who approaches not his wife in due season and reprehensible is the son who does not protect his mother after her husband has died
women must particularly be guarded against evil inclinations however trifling they may appear for if they are not guarded they will bring sorrow on two families
considering that the highest duty of all castes even weak husbands must strive to guard their wives
he who carefully guards his wife preserves the purity of his offspring virtuous conduct his family himself and his means of acquiring merit
the husband after conception by his wife becomes an embryo and is bom again of her for that is the wifehood of a wife gaya that he is bom gayate again by her
as the male is to whom a wife cleaves even so is the son whom she brings forth let him therefore carefully guard his wife in order to keep his offspring pure
no man can completely guard women by force but they can be guarded by the employment of the following expedients
let the husband employ his wife in the collection and expenditure of his wealth in keeping everything clean in the fulfilment of religious duties in the preparation of his food and in looking after the household utensils
women confined in the house under trustworthy and obedient servants are not well guarded but those who of their own accord keep guard over themselves are well guarded
drinking spirituous liquor associating with wicked people separation from the husband rambling abroad sleeping at unseasonable hours and dwelling in other mens houses are the six causes of the ruin of women
women do not care for beauty nor is their attention fixed on age thinking it is enough that he is a man they give themselves to the handsome and to the ugly
through their passion for men through their mutable temper through their natural heartlessness they become disloyal towards their husbands however carefully they may be guarded in this world
knowing their disposition which the lord of creatures laid in them at the creation to be such every man should most strenuously exert himself to guard them
when creating them manu allotted to women a love of their bed of their seat and of ornament impure desires wrath dishonesty malice and bad conduct
for women no sacramental rite is performed with sacred texts thus the law is settled women who are destitute of strength and destitute of the knowledge of vedic texts are as impure as falsehood itself that is a fixed rule
and to this effect many sacred texts are sung also in the vedas in order to make fully known the true disposition of women hear now those texts which refer to the expiation of their sins
if my mother going astray and unfaithful conceived illicit desires may my father keep that seed from me that is the scriptural text
if a woman thinks in her heart of anything that would pain her husband the abovementioned text is declared to be a means for completely removing such infidelity
whatever be the qualities of the man with whom a woman is united according to the law such qualities even she assumes like a river united with the ocean
akshamala a woman of the lowest birth being united to vasishtha and sarangi being united to mandapala became worthy of honour
these and other females of low birth have attained eminence in this world by the respective good qualities of their husbands
thus has been declared the ever pure popular usage which regulates the relations between husband and wife hear next the laws concerning children which are the cause of happiness in this world and after death
between wives striyah who are destined to bear children who secure many blessings who are worthy of worship and irradiate their dwellings and between the goddesses of fortune sriyah who reside in the houses of men there is no difference whatsoever
the production of children the nurture of those bom and the daily life of men of these matters woman is visibly the cause
offspring the due performance on religious rites faithful service highest conjugal happiness and heavenly bliss for the ancestors and oneself depend on ones wife alone
she who controlling her thoughts speech and acts violates not her duty towards her lord dwells with him after death in heaven and in this world is called by the virtuous a faithful wife sadhvi
but for disloyalty to her husband a wife is censured among men and in her next life she is bom in the womb of a jackal and tormented by diseases the punishment of her sin
listen now to the following holy discussion salutary to all men which the virtuous of the present day and the ancient great sages have held concerning male offspring
they all say that the male issue of a woman belongs to the lord but with respect to the meaning of the term lord the revealed texts differ some call the begetter of the child the lord others declare that it is the owner of the soil
by the sacred tradition the woman is declared to be the soil the man is declared to be the seed the production of all corporeal beings takes place through the union of the soil with the seed
in some cases the seed is more distinguished and in some the womb of the female but when both are equal the offspring is most highly esteemed
on comparing the seed and the receptacle of the seed the seed is declared to be more important for the offspring of all created beings is marked by the characteristics of the seed
whatever kind on seed is sown in a field prepared in due season a plant of that same kind marked with the peculiar qualities of the seed springs up in it
this earth indeed is called the primeval womb of created beings but the seed develops not in its development any properties of the womb
in this world seeds of different kinds sown at the proper time in the land even in one field come forth each according to its kind
the rice called vrihi and that called sali mudgabeans sesamum mashabeans barley leeks and sugarcane all spring up according to their seed
that one plant should be sown and another be produced cannot happen whatever seed is sown a plant of that kind even comes forth
never therefore must a prudent welltrained man who knows the veda and its angas and desires long life cohabit with anothers wife
with respect to this matter those acquainted with the past recite some stanzas sung by vayu the wind to show that seed must not be sown by any man on that which belongs to another
as the arrow shot by a hunter who afterwards hits a wounded deer in the wound made by another is shot in vain even so the seed sown on what belongs to another is quickly lost to the sower
sages who know the past call this earth prithivi even the wife of prithu they declare a field to belong to him who cleared away the timber and a deer to him who first wounded it
he only is a perfect man who consists of three persons united his wife himself and his offspring thus says the veda and learned brahmanas propound this maxim likewise the husband is declared to be one with the wife
neither by sale nor by repudiation is a wife released from her husband such we know the law to be which the lord of creatures pragapati made of old
once is the partition of the inheritance made once is a maiden given in marriage and once does a man say i will give each of those three acts is done once only
as with cows mares female camels slavegirls buffalocows shegoats and ewes it is not the begetter or his owner who obtains the offspring even thus it is with the wives of others
those who having no property in a field but possessing seedcorn sow it in anothers soil do indeed not receive the grain of the crop which may spring up
if one mans bull were to beget a hundred calves on another mans cows they would belong to the owner of the cows in vain would the bull have spent his strength
thus men who have no marital property in women but sow their seed in the soil of others benefit the owner of the woman but the giver of the seed reaps no advantage
if no agreement with respect to the crop has been made between the owner of the field and the owner of the seed the benefit clearly belongs to the owner of the field the receptacle is more important than the seed
but if by a special contract a field is made over to another for sowing then the owner of the seed and the owner of the soil are both considered in this world as sharers of the crop
if seed be carried by water or wind into somebodys field and germinates there the plant sprung from that seed belongs even to the owner of the field the owner of the seed does not receive the crop
know that such is the law concerning the offspring of cows mares slavegirls female camels shegoats and ewes as well as of females of birds and buffalocows
thus the comparative importance of the seed and of the womb has been declared to you i will next propound the law applicable to women in times of misfortune
the wife of an elder brother is for his younger brother the wife of a guru but the wife of the younger is declared to be the daughterinlaw of the elder
an elder brother who approaches the wife of the younger and a younger brother who approaches the wife of the elder except in times of misfortune both become outcasts even though they were duly authorised
on failure of issue by her husband a woman who has been authorised may obtain in the proper manner prescribed the desired offspring by cohabitation with a brotherinlaw or with some other sapinda of the husband
he who is appointed to cohabit with the widow shall approach her at night anointed with clarified butter and silent and beget one son by no means a second
some sages versed in the law considering the purpose of the appointment not to have been attained by those two on the birth of the first think that a second son may be lawfully procreated on such women
but when the purpose of the appointment to cohabit with the widow bas been attained in accordance with the law those two shall behave towards each other like a father and a daughterinlaw
if those two being thus appointed deviate from the rule and act from carnal desire they will both become outcasts as men who defile the bed of a daughterinlaw or of a guru
by twicebom men a widow must not be appointed to cohabit with any other than her husband for they who appoint her to another man will violate the eternal law
in the sacred texts which refer to marriage the appointment of widows is nowhere mentioned nor is the remarriage of widows prescribed in the rules concerning marriage
this practice which is reprehended by the learned of the twicebom castes as fit for cattle is said to have occurred even among men while vena ruled
that chief of royal sages who formerly possessed the whole world caused a confusion of the castes varna his intellect being destroyed by lust
since that time the virtuous censure that man who in his folly appoints a woman whose husband died to bear children to another man
if the future husband of a maiden dies after troth verbally plighted her brotherinlaw shall wed her according to the following rule
having according to the rule espoused her who must be clad in white garments and be intent on purity he shall approach her once in each proper season until issue be had
let no prudent man after giving his daughter to one man give her again to another for he who gives his daughter whom he had before given incurs the guilt of speaking falsely regarding a human being
though a man may have accepted a damsel in due form he may abandon her if she be blemished diseased or deflowered and if she have been given with fraud
if anybody gives away a maiden possessing blemishes without declaring them the bridegroom may annul that contract with the evilminded giver
a man who has business abroad may depart after securing a maintenance for his wife for a wife even though virtuous may be corrupted if she be distressed by want of subsistence
if the husband went on a journey after providing for her the wife shall subject herself to restraints in her daily life but if he departed without providing for her she may subsist by blameless manual work
if the husband went abroad for some sacred duty she must wait for him eight years if he went to acquire learning or fame six years if he went for pleasure three years
for one year let a husband bear with a wife who hates him but after the lapse of a year let him deprive her of her property and cease to cohabit with her
she who shows disrespect to a husband who is addicted to some evil passion is a drunkard or diseased shall be deserted for three months and be deprived of her ornaments and furniture
but she who shows aversion towards a mad or outcast husband a eunuch one destitute of manly strength or one afflicted with such diseases as punish crimes shall neither be cast off nor be deprived of her property
she who drinks spirituous liquor is of bad conduct rebellious diseased mischievous or wasteful may at any time be superseded by another wife
a barren wife may be superseded in the eighth year she whose children all die in the tenth she who bears only daughters in the eleventh but she who is quarrelsome without delay
but a sick wife who is kind to her husband and virtuous in her conduct may be superseded only with her own consent and must never be disgraced
a wife who being superseded in anger departs from her husbands house must either be instantly confined or cast off in the presence of the family
but she who though having been forbidden drinks spirituous liquor even at festivals or goes to public spectacles or assemblies shall be fined six krishnalas
if twicebom men wed women of their own and of other lower castes the seniority honour and habitation of those wives must be settled according to the order of the castes varna
among all twicebom men the wife of equal caste alone not a wife of a different caste by any means shall personally attend her husband and assist him in his daily sacred rites
but he who foolishly causes that duty to be performed by another while his wife of equal caste is alive is declared by the ancients to be as despicable as a kandala sprung from the brahmana caste
to a distinguished handsome suitor of equal caste should a father give his daughter in accordance with the prescribed rule though she have not attained the proper age
but the maiden though marriageable should rather stop in the fathers house until death than that he should ever give her to a man destitute of good qualities
three years let a damsel wait though she be marriageable but after that time let her choose for herself a bridegroom of equal caste and rank
if being not given in marriage she herself seeks a husband she incurs no guilt nor does he whom she weds
a maiden who choses for herself shall not take with her any ornaments given by her father or her mother or her brothers if she carries them away it will be theft
but he who takes to wife a marriageable damsel shall not pay any nuptial fee to her father for the latter will lose his dominion over her in consequence of his preventing the legitimate result of the appearance of her enemies
a man aged thirty years shall marry a maiden of twelve who pleases him or a man of twentyfour a girl eight years of age if the performance of his duties would otherwise be impeded he must marry sooner
the husband receives his wife from the gods he does not wed her according to his own will doing what is agreeable to the gods he must always support her while she is faithful
to be mothers were women created and to be fathers men religious rites therefore are ordained in the veda to be performed by the husband together with the wife
if after the nuptial fee has been paid for a maiden the giver of the fee dies she shall be given in marriage to his brother in case she consents
even a sudra ought not to take a nuptial fee when he gives away his daughter for he who takes a fee sell his daughter covering the transaction by another name
neither ancients nor moderns who were good men have done such a deed that after promising a daughter to one man they have her to another
nor indeed have we heard even in former creations of such a thing as the covert sale of a daughter for a fixed price called a nuptial fee
let mutual fidelity continue until death this may be considered as the summary of the highest law for husband and wife
let man and woman united in marriage constantly exert themselves that they may not be disunited and may not violate their mutual fidelity
thus has been declared to you the law for a husband and his wife which is intimately connected with conjugal happiness and the manner of raising offspring in times of calamity leam now the law concerning the division of the inheritance
after the death of the father and of the mother the brothers being assembled may divide among themselves in equal shares the paternal and the maternal estate for they have no power over it while the parents live
or the eldest alone may take the whole paternal estate the others shall live under him just as they lived under their father
immediately on the birth of his firstborn a man is called the father of a son and is freed from the debt to the manes that son therefore is worthy to receive the whole estate
that son alone on whom he throws his debt and through whom he obtains immortality is begotten for the fulfilment of the law all the rest they consider the offspring of desire
as a father supports his sons so let the eldest support his younger brothers and let them also in accordance with the law behave towards their eldest brother as sons behave towards their father
the eldest son makes the family prosperous or on the contrary brings it to ruin the eldest is considered among men most worthy of honour the eldest is not treated with disrespect by the virtuous
if the eldest brother behaves as an eldest brother ought to do he must be treated like a mother and like a father but if he behaves in a manner unworthy of an eldest brother he should yet be honoured like a kinsman
either let them thus live together or apart if each desires to gain spiritual merit for by their living separate their merit increases hence separation is meritorious
the additional share deducted for the eldest shall be onetwentieth of the estate and the best of all chattels for the middlemost half of that but for the youngest onefourth
both the eldest and the youngest shall take their shares according to the rule just stated each of those who are between the eldest and the youngest shall have the share prescribed for the middlemost
among the goods of every kind the eldest shall take the best article and even a single chattel which is particularly good as well as the best of ten animals
but among brothers equally skilled in their occupations there is no additional share consisting of the best animal among ten some trifle only shall be given to the eldest as a token of respect
if additional shares are thus deducted one must allot equal shares out of the residue to each but if no deduction is made the allotment of the shares among them shall be made in the following manner
let the eldest son take one share in excess the brother born next after him one share and a half the younger ones one share each thus the law is settled
but to the maiden sisters the brothers shall severally give portions out of their shares each out of his share onefourth part those who refuse to give it will become outcasts
let him never divide the value of a single goat or sheep or a single beast with uncloven hoofs it is prescribed that a single goat or sheep remaining after an equal division belongs to the eldest alone
if a younger brother begets a son on the wife of the elder the division must then be made equally this the law is settled
the representative the son begotten on the wife is not invested with the right of the principal the eldest brother to an additional share the principal became a father on the procreation of a son by his younger brother hence one should give a share to the son begotten on the wife of the elder brother according to the rule stated above
if there be a doubt how the division shall be made in case the younger son is born of the elder wife and the elder son of the younger wife
then the son born of the first wife shall take as his additional share one most excellent bull the next best bulls shall belong to those who are inferior on account of their mothers
but the eldest son being bom of the eldest wife shall receive fifteen cows and a bull the other sons may then take shares according to the seniority of their mothers that is a settled rule
between sons born of wives equal in caste and without any other distinction no seniority in right of the mother exists seniority is declared to be according to birth
and with respect to the subrahmanya texts also it is recorded that the invocation of indra shall be made by the firstborn of twins likewise conceived at one time in the wombs of their mothers the seniority is declared to depend on actual birth
he who has no son may make his daughter in the following manner an appointed daughter putrika saying to her husband the male child bom of her shall perform my funeral rites
according to this rule daksha himself lord of created beings formerly made all his female offspring appointed daughters in order to multiply his race
he gave ten to dharma thirteen to kasyapa twentyseven to king soma honouring them with an affectionate heart
a son is even as oneself such a daughter is equal to a son how can another heir take the estate while such an appointed daughter who is even oneself lives
but whatever may be the separate property of the mother that is the share of the unmarried daughter alone and the son of an appointed daughter shall take the whole estate of his maternal grandfather who leaves no son
the son of an appointed daughter indeed shall also take the estate of his own father who leaves no other son he shall then present two funeral cakes to his own father and to his maternal grandfather
between a sons son and the son of an appointed daughter there is no difference neither with respect to worldly matters nor to sacred duties for their father and mother both sprang from the body of the same man
but if after a daughter has been appointed a son be born to her father the division of the inheritance must in that case be equal for there is no right of primogeniture for a woman
but if an appointed daughter by accident dies without leaving a son the husband of the appointed daughter may without hesitation take that estate
through that son whom a daughter either not appointed or appointed may bear to a husband of equal caste his maternal grandfather has a sons son he shall present the funeral cake and take the estate
through a son he conquers the worlds through a sons son he obtains immortality but through his sons grandson he gains the world of the sun
because a son delivers trayate his father from the hell called put he was therefore called puttra a deliverer from put by the selfexistent svayambhu himself
between a sons son and the son of a daughter there exists in this world no difference for even the son of a daughter saves him who has no sons in the next world like the sons son
let the son of an appointed daughter first present a funeral cake to his mother the second to her father the funeral to his fathers father
of the man who has an adopted datrima son possessing all good qualities that same son shall take the inheritance though brought from another family
an adopted son shall never take the family name and the estate of his natural father the funeral cake follows the family name and the estate the funeral offerings of him who gives his son in adoption cease as far as that son is concerned
the son of a wife not appointed to have issue by another and he whom an appointed female already the mother of a son bears to her brotherinlaw are both unworthy of a share one being the son of an adulterer and the other produced through mere lust
even the male child of a female duly appointed not begotten according to the rule given above is unworthy of the paternal estate for he was procreated by an outcast
a son legally begotten on such an appointed female shall inherit like a legitimate son of the body for that seed and the produce belong according to the law to the owner of the soil
he who takes care of his deceased brothers estate and of his widow shall after raising up a son for his brother give that property even to that son
if a woman duly appointed bears a son to her brotherinlaw or to another sapinda that son if he is begotten through desire they declare to be incapable of inheriting and to be produced in vain
the rules given above must be understood to apply to a distribution among sons of women of the same caste hear now the law concerning those begotten by one man on many wives of different castes
if there be four wives of a brahmana in the direct order of the castes the rule for the division of the estate among the sons born of them is as follows
the slave who tills the field the bull kept for impregnating cows the vehicle the ornaments and the house shall be given as an additional portion to the brahmana son and one most excellent share
let the son of the brahmana wife take three shares of the remainder of the estate the son of the kshatriya two the son of the vaisya a share and a half and the son of the sudra may take one share
or let him who knows the law make ten shares of the whole estate and justly distribute them according to the following rule
the brahmana son shall take four shares son of the kshatriya wife three the son of the vaisya shall have two parts the son of the sudra may take one share
whether a brahmana have sons or have no sons by wives of the twicebom castes the heir must according to the law give to the son of a sudra wife no more than a tenth part of his estate
the son of a brahmana a kshatriya and a vaisya by a sudra wife receives no share of the inheritance whatever his father may give to him that shall be his property
all the sons of twiceborn men bom of wives of the same caste shall equally divide the estate after the others have given to the eldest an additional share
for a sudra is ordained a wife of his own caste only and no other those bom of her shall have equal shares even if there be a hundred sons
among the twelve sons of men whom manu sprung from the selfexistent svayambhu enumerates six are kinsmen and heirs and six not heirs but kinsmen
the legitimate son of the body the son begotten on a wife the son adopted the son made the son secretly born and the son cast off are the six heirs and kinsmen
the son of an unmarried damsel the son received with the wife the son bought the son begotten on a re married woman the son selfgiven and the son of a sudra female are the six who are not heirs but kinsmen
whatever result a man obtains who tries to cross a sheet of water in an unsafe boat even that result obtains he who tries to pass the gloom of the next world with the help of bad substitutes for a real son
if the two heirs of one man be a legitimate son of his body and a son begotten on his wife each of the two sons to the exclusion of the other shall take the estate of his natural father
the legitimate son of the body alone shall be the owner of the paternal estate but in order to avoid harshness let him allow a maintenance to the rest
but when the legitimate son of the body divides the paternal estate he shall give onesixth or onefifth part of his fathers property to the son begotten on the wife
the legitimate son and the son of the wife thus share the fathers estate but the other tell become members of the family and inherit according to their order each later named on failure of those named earlier
him whom a man begets on his own wedded wife let him know to be a legitimate son of the body auras a the first in rank
he who was begotten according to the peculiar law of the niyoga on the appointed wife of a dead man of a eunuch or of one diseased is called a son begotten on a wife kshetraga
that boy equal by caste whom his mother or his father affectionately give confirming the gift with a libation of water in times of distress to a man as his son must be considered as an adopted son datrima
but he is considered a son made kritrima whom a man makes his son he being equal by caste acquainted with the distinctions between right and wrong and endowed with filial virtues
if a child be born in a mans house and his father be not known he is a son bom secretly in the house gudhotpanna and shall belong to him of whose wife he was bom
he whom a man receives as his son after he has been deserted by his parents or by either of them is called a son cast off apaviddha
a son whom a damsel secretly bears in the house of her father one shall name the son of an unmarried damsel kanina and declare such offspring of an unmarried girl to belong to him who weds her afterwards
if one marries either knowingly or unknowingly a pregnant bride the child in her womb belongs to him who weds her and is called a son received with the bride sahodha
if a man buys a boy whether equal or unequal in good qualities from his father and mother for the sake of having a son that child is called a son bought kritaka
if a woman abandoned by her husband or a widow of her own accord contracts a second marriage and bears a son he is called the son of a remarried woman paunarbhava
if she be still a virgin or one who returned to her first husband after leaving him she is worthy to again perform with her second or first deserted husband the nuptial ceremony
he who having lost his parents or being abandoned by them without just cause gives himself to a man is called a son selfgiven svayamdatta
the son whom a brahmana begets through lust on a sudra female is though alive parayan a corpse sava and hence called a parasava a living corpse
a son who is begotten by a sudra on a female slave or on the female slave of his slave may if permitted by his father take a share of the inheritance thus the law is settled
these eleven the son begotten on the wife and the rest as enumerated above the wise call substitutes for a son taken in order to prevent a failure of the funeral ceremonies
those sons who have been mentioned in connection with the legitimate son of the body being begotten by strangers belong in reality to him from whose seed they sprang but not to the other man who took them
if among brothers sprung from one father one have a son manu has declared them all to have male offspring through that son
if among all the wives of one husband one have a son manu declares them all to be mothers of male children through that son
on failure of each better son each next inferior one is worthy of the inheritance but if there be many of equal rank they shall all share the estate
not brothers nor fathers but sons take the paternal estate but the father shall take the inheritance of a son who leaves no male issue and his brothers
to three ancestors water must be offered to three the funeral cake is given the fourth descendant is the giver of these oblations the fifth has no connection with them
always to that relative within three degrees who is nearest to the deceased sapinda the estate shall belong afterwards a sakulya shall be the heir then the spiritual teacher or the pupil
but on failure of all heirs brahmanas shall share the estate who are versed the in the three vedas pure and selfcontrolled thus the law is not violated
the property of a brahmana must never be taken by the king that is a settled rule but the property of men of other castes the king may take on failure of all heirs
if the widow of a man who died without leaving issue raises up to him a son by a member of the family sagotra she shall deliver to that son the whole property which belonged to the deceased
but if two sons begotten by two different men contend for the property in the hands of their mother each shall take to the exclusion of the other what belonged to his father
but when the mother has died all the uterine brothers and the uterine sisters shall equally divide the mothers estate
even to the daughters of those daughters something should be given as is seemly out of the estate of their maternal grandmother on the score of affection
what was given before the nuptial fire what was given on the bridal procession what was given in token of love and what was received from her brother mother or father that is called the sixfold property of a woman
such property as well as a gift subsequent and what was given to her by her affectionate husband shall go to her offspring even if she dies in the lifetime of her husband
it is ordained that the property of a woman married according to the brahma the daiva the arsha the gandharva or the pragapatya rite shall belong to her husband alone if she dies without issue
but it is prescribed that the property which may have been given to a wife on an asura marriage or one of the other blamable marriages shall go to her mother and to her father if she dies without issue
whatever property may have been given by her father to a wife who has cowives of different castes that the daughter of the brahmani wife shall take or that daughters issue
women should never make a hoard from the property of their families which is common to many nor from their own husbands particular property without permission
the ornaments which may have been worn by women during their husbands lifetime his heirs shall not divide those who divide them become outcasts
eunuchs and outcasts persons bom blind or deaf the insane idiots and the dumb as well as those deficient in any organ of action or sensation receive no share
but it is just that a man who knows the law should give even to all of them food and raiment without stint according to his ability he who gives it not will become all outcast
if the eunuch and the rest should somehow or other desire to take wives the offspring of such among them as have children is worthy of a share
whatever property the eldest son acquires by his own exertion after the fathers death a share of that shall belong to his younger brothers provided they have made a due progress in learning
but if all of them being unlearned acquire property by their labour the division of that shall be equal as it is not property acquired by the father that is a settled rule
property acquired by learning belongs solely to him to whom it was given likewise the gift of a friend a present received on marriage or with the honeymixture
but if one of the brothers being able to maintain himself by his own occupation does not desire a share of the family property he may be made separate by the others receiving a trifle out of his share to live upon
what one brother may acquire by his labour without using the patrimony that acquisition made solely by his own effort he shall not share unless by his own will with his brothers
but if a father recovers lost ancestral property he shall not divide it unless by his own will with his sons for it is selfacquired property
if brothers once divided and living again together as coparceners make a second partition the division shall in that case be equal in such a case there is no right of primogeniture
if the eldest or the youngest brother is deprived of his share or if either of them dies his share is not lost to his immediate heirs
his uterine brothers having assembled together shall equally divide it and those brothers who were reunited with him and the uterine sisters
an eldest brother who through avarice may defraud the younger ones shall no longer hold the position of the eldest shall not receive an eldest sons additional share and shall be punished by the king
all brothers who habitually commit forbidden acts are unworthy of a share of the property and the eldest shall not make anything his separate property without giving an equivalent to his younger brothers
if undivided brethren living with their father together make an exertion for gain the father shall on no account give to them unequal shares on a division of the estate
but a son bom after partition shall alone take the property of his father or if any of the other sons be reunited with the father he shall share with them
a mother shall obtain the inheritance of a son who dies without leaving issue and if the mother be dead the paternal grandmother shall take the estate
and if after all the debts and assets have been duly distributed according to the rule any property be afterwards discovered one must divide it equally
a dress a vehicle ornaments cooked food water and female slaves property destined for pious uses or sacrifices and a pastureground they declare to be indivisible
the division of the property and the rules for allotting shares to the several sons those begotten on a wife and the rest in due order have been thus declared to you hear now the laws concerning gambling
gambling and betting let the king exclude from his realm those two vices cause the destruction of the kingdoms of princes
gambling and betting amount to open theft the king shall always exert himself in suppressing both of them
when inanimate things are used for staking money on them that is called among men gambling dyuta when animate beings are used for the same purpose one must know that to be betting samahvaya
let the king corporally punish all those persons who either gamble and bet or afford an opportunity for it likewise sudras who assume the distinctive marks of twiceborn men
gamblers dancers and singers cruel men men belonging to an heretical sect those following forbidden occupations and sellers of spirituous liquor let him instantly banish from his town
if such persons who are secret thieves dwell in the realm of a king they constantly harass his good subjects by their forbidden practices
in a former kalpa this vice of gambling has been seen to cause great enmity a wise man therefore should not practise it even for amusement
on every man who addicts himself to that vice either secretly or openly the king may inflict punishment according to his discretion
but a kshatriya a vaisya and a sudra who are unable to pay a fine shall discharge the debt by labour a brahmana shall pay it by installments
on women infants men of disordered mind the poor and the sick the king shall inflict punishment with a whip a cane or a rope and the like
but those appointed to administer public affairs who baked by the fire of wealth mar the business of suitors the king shall deprive of their property
forgers of royal edicts those who corrupt his ministers those who slay women infants or brahmanas and those who serve his enemies the king shall put to death
whenever any legal transaction has been completed or a punishment been inflicted according to the law he shall sanction it and not annul it
whatever matter his ministers or the judge may settle improperly that the king himself shall re settle and fine them one thousand panas
the slayer of a brahmana a twicebom man who drinks the spirituous liquor called sura he who steals the gold of a brahmana and he who violates a gurus bed must each and all be considered as men who committed mortal sins mahapataka
on those four even if they do not perform a penance let him inflict corporal punishment and fines in accordance with the law
for violating a gurus bed the mark of a female part shall be impressed on the forehead with a hot iron for drinking the spirituous liquor called sura the sign of a tavern for stealing the gold of a brahmana a dogs foot for murdering a brahmana a headless corpse
excluded from all fellowship at meals excluded from all sacrifices excluded from instruction and from matrimonial alliances abject and excluded from all religious duties let them wander over this earth
such persons who have been branded with indelible marks must be cast off by their paternal and maternal relations and receive neither compassion nor a salutation that is the teaching of manu
but men of all castes who perform the prescribed penances must not be branded on the forehead by the king but shall be made to pay the highest amercement
for such offences the middlemost amercement shall be inflicted on a brahmana or he may be banished from the realm keeping his money and his chattels
but men of other castes who have unintentionally committed such crimes ought to be deprived of their whole property if they committed them intentionally they shall be banished
a virtuous king must not take for himself the property of a man guilty of mortal sin but if he takes it out of greed he is tainted by that guilt of the offender
having thrown such a fine into the water let him offer it to varuna or let him bestow it on a learned and virtuous brahmana
varuna is the lord of punishment for he holds the sceptre even over kings a brahmana who has learnt the whole veda is the lord of the whole world
in that country where the king avoids taking the property of mortal sinners men are born in due time and are longlived
and the crops of the husbandmen spring up each as it was sown and the children die not and no misshaped offspring is born
but the king shall inflict on a baseborn sudra who intentionally gives pain to brahmanas various kinds of corporal punishment which cause terror
when a king punishes an innocent man his guilt is considered as great as when he sets free a guilty man but he acquires merit when he punishes justly
thus the manner of deciding suits falling under the eighteen titles between two litigant parties has been declared at length
a king who thus duly fulfils his duties in accordance with justice may seek to gain countries which he has not yet gained and shall duly protect them when he has gained them
having duly settled his country and having built forts in accordance with the institutes he shall use his utmost exertions to remove those men who are nocuous like thorns
by protecting those who live as becomes aryans and by removing the thorns kings solely intent on guarding their subjects reach heaven
the realm of that king who takes his share in kind though he does not punish thieves will be disturbed and he will lose heaven
but if his kingdom be secure protected by the strength of his arm it will constantly flourish like a well watered tree
let the king who sees everything through his spies discover the two sorts of thieves who deprive others of their property both those who show themselves openly and those who lie concealed
among them the open rogues are those who subsist by cheating in the sale of various marketable commodities but the concealed rogues are burglars robbers in forests and so forth
those who take bribes cheats and rogues gamblers those who live by teaching the performance of auspicious ceremonies sanctimonious hypocrites and fortunetellers
officials of high rank and physicians who act improperly men living by showing their proficiency in arts and clever harlots
these and the like who show themselves openly as well as others who walk in disguise such as non aryans who wear the marks of aryans he should know to be thorns in the side of his people
having detected them by means of trustworthy persons who disguising themselves pretend to follow the same occupations and by means of spies wearing various disguises he must cause them to be instigated to commit offences and bring them into his power
then having caused the crimes which they committed by their several actions to be proclaimed in accordance with the facts the king shall duly punish them according to their strength and their crimes
for the wickedness of evilminded thieves who secretly prowl over this earth cannot be restrained except by punishment
assemblyhouses houses where water is distributed or cakes are sold brothels taverns and victuallers shops crossroads wellknown trees festive assemblies and playhouses and concertrooms
old gardens forests the shops of artisans empty dwellings natural and artificial groves
these and the like places the king shall cause to be guarded by companies of soldiers both stationary and patrolling and by spies in order to keep away thieves
by the means of clever reformed thieves who associate with such rogues follow them and know their various machinations he must detect and destroy them
under the pretext of offering them various dainties of introducing them to brahmanas and on the pretence of showing them feats of strength the spies must make them meet the officers of justice
those among them who do not come and those who suspect the old thieves employed by the king the king shall attack by force and slay together with their friends blood relations and connexions
a just king shall not cause a thief to be put to death unless taken with the stolen goods in his possession him who is taken with the stolen goods and the implements of burglary he may without hesitation cause to be slain
all those also who in villages give food to thieves or grant them room for concealing their implements he shall cause to be put to death
those who are appointed to guard provinces and his vassals who have been ordered to help he shall speedily punish like thieves if they remain inactive in attacks by robbers
moreover if a man who subsists by the fulfilment of the law departs from the established rule of the law the king shall severely punish him by a fine because he violated his duty
those who do not give assistance according to their ability when a village is being plundered a dyke is being destroyed or a highway robbery committed shall be banished with their goods and chattels
on those who rob the kings treasury and those who persevere in opposing his commands he shall inflict various kinds of capital punishment likewise on those who conspire with his enemies
but the king shall cut off the hands of those robbers who breaking into houses commit thefts at night and cause them to be impaled on a pointed stake
on the first conviction let him cause two fingers of a cutpurse to be amputated on the second one hand and one foot on the third he shall suffer death
those who give to thieves fire food arms or shelter and receivers of stolen goods the ruler shall punish like thieves
him who breaks the dam of a tank he shall slay by drowning him in water or by some other mode of capital punishment or the offender may repair the damage but shall be made to pay the highest amercement
those who break into a royal storehouse an armoury or a temple and those who steal elephants horses or chariots he shall slay without hesitation
but he who shall take away the water of a tank made in ancient times or shall cut off the supply of water must be made to pay the first or lowest amercement
but he who except in a case of extreme necessity drops filth on the kings highroad shall pay two karshapanas and immediately remove that filth
but a person in urgent necessity an aged man a pregnant woman or a child shall be reprimanded and clean the place that is a settled rule
all physicians who treat their patients wrongly shall pay a fine in the case of animals the first or lowest in the case of human beings the middlemost amercement
he who destroys a bridge the flag of a temple or royal palace a pole or images shall repair the whole damage and pay five hundred panas
for adulterating unadulterated commodities and for breaking gems or for improperly boring them the fine is the first or lowest amercement
but that man who behaves dishonestly to honest customers or cheats in his prices shall be fined in the first or in the middlemost amercement
let him place all prisons near a highroad where the suffering and disfigured offenders can be seen
him who destroys the wall of a town or fills up the ditch round a town or breaks a town gate he shall instantly banish
for all incantations intended to destroy life for magic rites with roots practised by persons not related to him against whom they are directed and for various kinds of sorcery a fine of two hundred panas shall be inflicted
he who sells for seedcorn that which is not seedcom he who takes up seed already sown and he who destroys a boundary mark shall be punished by mutilation
but the king shall cause a goldsmith who behaves dishonestly the most nocuous of all the thorns to be cut to pieces with razors
for the theft of agricultural implements of arms and of medicines let the king award punishment taking into account the time of the offence and the use of the object
the king and his minister his capital his realm his treasury his army and his ally are the seven constituent parts of a kingdom hence a kingdom is said to have seven limbs anga
but let him know that among these seven constituent parts of a kingdom which have been enumerated in due order each earlier named is more important and its destruction the greater calamity
yet in a kingdom containing seven constituent parts which is upheld like the triple staff of an ascetic there is no single part more important than the others by reason of the importance of the qualities of each for the others
for each part is particularly qualified for the accomplishment of certain objects and thus each is declared to be the most important for that particular purpose which is effected by its means
by spies by a pretended display of energy and by carrying out various undertakings let the king constantly ascertain his own and his enemys strength
moreover all calamities and vices afterwards when he has fully considered their relative importance let him begin his operations
though he be ever so much tired by repeated failures let him begin his operations again and again for fortune greatly favours the man who strenuously exerts himself in his undertakings
the various ways in which a king behaves resemble the krita treta dvapara and kali ages hence the king is identified with the ages of the world
sleeping he represents the kali or iron age waking the dvapara or brazen age ready to act the treta or silver age but moving actively the krita or golden age
let the king emulate the energetic action of indra of the sun of the wind of yama of varuna of the moon of the fire and of the earth
as indra sends copious rain during the four months of the rainy season even so let the king taking upon himself the office of indra shower benefits on his kingdom
as the sun during eight months imperceptibly draws up the water with his rays even so let him gradually draw his taxes from his kingdom for that is the office in which he resembles the sun
as the wind moves everywhere entering in the shape of the vital air all created beings even so let him penetrate everywhere through his spies that is the office in which he resembles the wind
as yama at the appointed time subjects to his rule both friends and foes even so all subjects must be controlled by the king that is the office in which he resembles yama
as a sinner is seen bound with ropes by varuna even so let him punish the wicked that is his office in which he resembles varuna
he is a king taking upon himself the office of the moon whose appearance his subjects greet with as great joy as men feel on seeing the full moon
if he is ardent in wrath against criminals and endowed with brilliant energy and destroys wicked vassals then his character is said to resemble that of fire
as the earth supports all created beings equally thus a king who supports all his subjects takes upon himself the office of the earth
employing these and other means the king shall ever untired restrain thieves both in his own dominions and in those of others
let him not though fallen into the deepest distress provoke brahmanas to anger for they when angered could instantly destroy him together with his army and his vehicles
who could escape destruction when he provokes to anger those men by whom the fire was made to consume all things by whom the water of the ocean was made undrinkable and by whom the moon was made to wane and to increase again
who could prosper while he injures those men who provoked to anger could create other worlds and other guardians of the world and deprive the gods of their divine station
what man desirous of life would injure them to whose support the three worlds and the gods ever owe their existence and whose wealth is the veda
a brahmana be he ignorant or learned is a great divinity just as the fire whether carried forth for the performance of a burntoblation or not carried forth is a great divinity
the brilliant fire is not contaminated even in burialplaces and when presented with oblations of butter at sacrifices it again increases mightily
thus though brahmanas employ themselves in all sorts of mean occupations they must be honoured in every way for each of them is a very great deity
when the kshatriyas become in any way overbearing towards the brahmanas the brahmanas themselves shall duly restrain them for the kshatriyas sprang from the brahmanas
fire sprang from water kshatriyas from brahmanas iron from stone the allpenetrating force of those three has no effect on that whence they were produced
kshatriyas prosper not without brahmanas brahmanas prosper not without kshatriyas brahmanas and kshatriyas being closely united prosper in this world and in the next
but a king who feels his end drawing nigh shall bestow all his wealth accumulated from fines on brahmanas make over his kingdom to his son and then seek death in battle
thus conducting himself and ever intent on discharging his royal duties a king shall order all his servants to work for the good of his people
thus the eternal law concerning the duties of a king has been fully declared know that the following rules apply in due order to the duties of vaisyas and sudras
after a vaisya has received the sacraments and has taken a wife he shall be always attentive to the business whereby he may subsist and to that of tending cattle
for when the lord of creatures pragapati created cattle he made them over to the vaisya to the brahmana and to the king he entrusted all created beings
a vaisya must never conceive this wish i will not keep cattle and if a vaisya is willing to keep them they must never be kept by men of other castes
a vaisya must know the respective value of gems of pearls of coral of metals of cloth made of thread of perfumes and of condiments
he must be acquainted with the manner of sowing of seeds and of the good and bad qualities of fields and he must perfectly know all measures and weights
moreover the excellence and defects of commodities the advantages and disadvantages of different countries the probable profit and loss on merchandise and the means of properly rearing cattle
he must be acquainted with the proper wages of servants with the various languages of men with the manner of keeping goods and the rules of purchase and sale
let him exert himself to the utmost in order to increase his property in a righteous manner and let him zealously give food to all created beings
but to serve brahmanas who are learned in the vedas householders and famous for virtue is the highest duty of a sudra which leads to beatitude
a sudra who is pure the servant of his betters gentle in his speech and free from pride and always seeks a refuge with brahmanas attains in his next life a higher caste
the excellent law for the conduct of the four castes varna when they are not in distress has been thus promulgated now hear in order their several duties in times of distress
let the three twiceborn castes vama discharging their prescribed duties study the veda but among them the brahmana alone shall teach it not the other two that is an established rule
the brahmana must know the means of subsistence prescribed by law for all instruct the others and himself live according to the law
on account of his preeminence on account of the superiority of his origin on account of his observance of particular restrictive rules and on account of his particular sanctification the brahmana is the lord of all castes varna
brahmana the kshatriya and the vaisya castes vama are the twiceborn ones but the fourth the sudra has one birth only there is no fifth caste
in all castes varna those children only which are begotten in the direct order on wedded wives equal in caste and married as virgins are to be considered as belonging to the same caste as their fathers
sons begotten by twiceborn man on wives of the next lower castes they declare to be similar to their fathers but blamed on account of the fault inherent in their mothers
such is the eternal law concerning children bom of wives one degree lower than their husbands know that the following rule is applicable to those bom of women two or three degrees lower
from a brahmana a with the daughter of a vaisya is bom a son called an ambashtha with the daughter of a sudra a nishada who is also called parasava
from a kshatriya and the daughter of a sudra springs a being called ugra resembling both a kshatriya and a sudra ferocious in his manners and delighting in cruelty
children of a brahmana by women of the three lower castes of a kshatriya by wives of the two lower castes and of a vaisya by a wife of the one caste below him are all six called basebom apasada
from a kshatriya by the daughter of a brahmana is bom a son called according to his caste gati a suta from a vaisya by females of the royal and the brahmana castes spring a magadha and a vaideha
from a sudra are bom an ayogava a kshattri and a kandala the lowest of men by vaisya kshatriya and brahmana females sons who owe their origin to a confusion of the castes
as an ambashtha and an ugra begotten in the direct order on women one degree lower than their husbands are declared to be even so are a kshattri and a vaidehaka though they were born in the inverse order of the castes from mothers one degree higher than the fathers
those sons of the twicebom begotten on wives of the next lower castes who have been enumerated in due order they call by the name anantaras belonging to the next lower caste on account of the blemish inherent in their mothers
a brahmana begets on the daughter of an ugra an avrita on the daughter of an ambashtha an abhira but on a female of the ayogava caste a dhigvana
from a sudra spring in the inverse order by females of the higher castes three baseborn sons apasada an ayogava a kshattri and a kandala the lowest of men
from a vaisya are bom in the inverse order of the castes a magadha and a vaideha but from a kshatriya a suta only these are three other basebom ones apasada
the son of a nishada by a sudra female becomes a pukkasa by caste gati but the son of a sudra by a nishada female is declared to be a kukkutaka
moreover the son of by kshattri by an ugra female is called a svapaka but one begotten by a vaidehaka on an ambashtha female is named a vena
those sons whom the twiceborn beget on wives of equal caste but who not fulfilling their sacred duties are excluded from the savitri one must designate by the appellation vratyas
but from a vratya of the brahmana caste spring the wicked bhriggakantaka the avantya the vatadhana the pushpadha and the saikha
from a vratya of the kshatriya caste the ghalla the malla the likkhivi the nata the karana the khasa and the dravida
from a vratya of the vaisya caste are born a sudhanvan an akarya a karusha a viganman a maitra and a satvata
by adultery committed by persons of different castes by marriages with women who ought not to be married and by the neglect of the duties and occupations prescribed to each are produced sons who owe their origin to a confusion the castes
will now fully enumerate those sons of mixed origin who are born of anulomas and of pratilomas and thus are mutually connected
the suta the vaidehaka the kandala that lowest of mortals the magadha he of the kshattri caste gati and the ayogava
these six pratilomas beget similar races varna on women of their own caste they also produce the like with females of their mothers caste gati and with females of higher ones
as a brahmana begets on females of two out of the three twiceborn castes a son similar to himself but inferior on account of the lower degree of the mother and one equal to himself on a female of his own race even so is the order in the case of the excluded races vahya
those six mentioned above also beget the one on the females of the other a great many kinds of despicable sons even more sinful than their fathers and excluded from the aryan community vahya
just as a sudra begets on a brahmana female a being excluded from the aryan community even so a person himself excluded pro creates with females of the four castes vama sons more worthy of being excluded than he himself
but men excluded by the aryans vahya who approach females of higher rank beget races vama still more worthy to be excluded low men hina still lower races even fifteen in number
a dasyu begets on an ayogava woman a sairandhra who is skilled in adorning and attending his master who though not a slave lives like a slave or subsists by snaring animals
a vaideha produces with the same a sweetvoiced maitreyaka who ringing a bell at the appearance of dawn continually praises great men
a nishada begets on the same a margava or dasa who subsists by working as a boatman and whom the inhabitants of aryavarta call a kaivarta
those three basebom ones are severally begot on ayogava women who wear the clothes of the dead are wicked and eat reprehensible food
from a nishada springs by a woman of the vaideha caste a karavara who works in leather and from a vaidehaka by women of the karavara and nishada castes an andhra and a meda who dwell outside the village
from a kandala by a vaideha woman is bom a pandusopaka who deals in cane from a nishada by the same an ahindika
but from a kandala by a pukkasa woman is born the sinful sopaka who lives by the occupations of his sire and is ever despised by good men
a nishada woman bears to a kandala a son called antyavasayin employed in burialgrounds and despised even by those excluded from the aryan community
these races which originate in a confusion of the castes and have been described according to their fathers and mothers may be known by their occupations whether they conceal or openly show themselves
six sons begotten by aryans on women of equal and the next lower castes anantara have the duties of twiceborn men but all those born in consequence of a violation of the law are as regards their duties equal to sudras
by the power of austerities and of the seed from which they sprang these races obtain here among men more exalted or lower rank in successive births
but in consequence of the omission of the sacred rites and of their not consulting brahmanas the following tribes of kshatriyas have gradually sunk in this world to the condition of sudras
viz the paundrakas the kodas the dravidas the kambogas the yavanas the sakas the paradas the pahlavas the kinas the kiratas and the daradas
all those tribes in this world which are excluded from the community of those born from the mouth the arms the thighs and the feet of brahman are called dasyus whether they speak the language of the mlekkhas barbarians or that of the aryans
those who have been mentioned as the basebom offspring apasada of aryans or as produced in consequence of a violation of the law apadhvamsaga shall subsist by occupations reprehended by the twice born
to sutas belongs the management of horses and of chariots to ambashthas the art of healing to vaidehakas the service of women to magadhas trade
killing fish to nishadas carpenters work to the ayogava to medas andhras kunkus and madgus the slaughter of wild animals
to kshattris ugras and pukkasas catching and killing animals living in holes to dhigvanas working in leather to venas playing drums
near wellknown trees and burialgrounds on mountains and in groves let these tribes dwell known by certain marks and subsisting by their peculiar occupations
but the dwellings of kandalas and svapakas shall be outside the village they must be made apapatras and their wealth shall be dogs and donkeys
their dress shall be the garments of the dead they shall eat their food from broken dishes black iron shall be their ornaments and they must always wander from place to place
a man who fulfils a religious duty shall not seek intercourse with them their transactions shall be among themselves and their marriages with their equals
their food shall be given to them by others than an aryan giver in a broken dish at night they shall not walk about in villages and in towns
by day they may go about for the purpose of their work distinguished by marks at the kings command and they shall carry out the corpses of persons who have no relatives that is a settled rule
by the kings order they shall always execute the criminals in accordance with the law and they shall take for themselves the clothes the beds and the ornaments of such criminals
a man of impure origin who belongs not to any caste vama but whose character is not known who though not an aryan has the appearance of an aryan one may discover by his acts
behaviour unworthy of an aryan harshness cruelty and habitual neglect of the prescribed duties betray in this world a man of impure origin
a baseborn man either resembles in character his father or his mother or both he can never conceal his real nature
even if a man born in a great family sprang from criminal intercourse he will certainly possess the faults of his father be they small or great
but that kingdom in which such bastards sullying the purity of the castes are bom perishes quickly together with its inhabitants
dying without the expectation of a reward for the sake of brahmanas and of cows or in the defence of women and children secures beatitude to those excluded from the aryan community vahya
abstention from injuring creatures veracity abstention from unlawfully appropriating the goods of others purity and control of the organs manu has declared to be the summary of the law for the four castes
if a female of the caste sprung from a brahmana and a sudra female bear children to one of the highest caste the inferior tribe attains the highest caste within the seventh generation
thus a sudra attains the rank of a brahmana and in a similar manner a brahmana sinks to the level of a sudra but know that it is the same with the offspring of a kshatriya or of a vaisya
if a doubt should arise with whom the preeminence is whether with him whom an aryan by chance begot on a non aryan female or with the son of a brahmana woman by a non aryan
the decision is as follows he who was begotten by an aryan on a nonaryan female may become like to an aryan by his virtues he whom an aryan mother bore to a nonaryan father is and remains unlike to an aryan
the law prescribes that neither of the two shall receive the sacraments the first being excluded on account of the lowness of his origin the second because the union of his parents was against the order of the castes
as good seed springing up in good soil turns out perfectly well even so the son of an aryan by an aryan woman is worthy of all the sacraments
some sages declare the seed to be more important and others the field again others assert that the seed and the field are equally important but the legal decision on this point is as follows
seed sown on barren ground perishes in it a fertile field also in which no good seed is sown will remain barren
as through the power of the seed sons born of animals became sages who are honoured and praised hence the seed is declared to be more important
having considered the case of a non aryan who acts like an aryan and that of an aryan who acts like a non aryan the creator declared those two are neither equal nor unequal
brahmanas who are intent on the means of gaining union with brahman and firm in discharging their duties shall live by duly performing the following six acts which are enumerated in their proper order
teaching studying sacrificing for himself sacrificing for others making gifts and receiving them are the six acts prescribed for a brahmana
but among the six acts ordained for him three are his means of subsistence viz sacrificing for others teaching and accepting gifts from pure men
passing from the brahmana to the kshatriya three acts incumbent on the former are forbidden viz teaching sacrificing for others and thirdly the acceptance of gifts
the same are likewise forbidden to a vaisya that is a settled rule for manu the lord of creatures pragapati has not prescribed them for men of those two castes
to carry arms for striking and for throwing is prescribed for kshatriyas as a means of subsistence to trade to rear cattle and agriculture for vaisyas but their duties are liberality the study of the veda and the performance of sacrifices
among the several occupations the most commendable are teaching the veda for a brahmana protecting the people for a kshatriya and trade for a vaisya
but a brahmana unable to subsist by his peculiar occupations just mentioned may live according to the law applicable to kshatriyas for the latter is next to him in rank
if it be asked how shall it be if he cannot maintain himself by either of these occupations the answer is he may adopt a vaisyas mode of life employing himself in agriculture and rearing cattle
but a brahmana or a kshatriya living by a vaisyas mode of subsistence shall carefully avoid the pursuit of agriculture which causes injury to many beings and depends on others
some declare that agriculture is something excellent but that means of subsistence is blamed by the virtuous for the wooden implement with iron point injuries the earth and the beings living in the earth
but he who through a want of means of subsistence gives up the strictness with respect to his duties may sell in order to increase his wealth the commodities sold by vaisyas making however the following exceptions
he must avoid selling condiments of all sorts cooked food and sesamum stones salt cattle and human beings
all dyed cloth as well as cloth made of hemp or flax or wool even though they be not dyed fruit roots and medical herbs
water weapons poison meat soma and perfumes of all kinds fresh milk honey sour milk clarified butter oil wax sugar kusagrass
all beasts of the forest animals with fangs or tusks birds spirituous liquor indigo lac and all one hoofed beasts
but he who subsists by agriculture may at pleasure sell unmixed sesamum grains for sacred purposes provided he himself has grown them and has not kept them long
if he applies sesamum to any other purpose but food anointing and charitable gifts he will be born again as a worm and together with his ancestors be plunged into the ordure of dogs
by selling flesh salt and lac a brahmana at once becomes an outcast by selling milk he becomes equal to a sudra in three days
but by willingly selling in this world other forbidden commodities a brahmana assumes after seven nights the character of a vaisya
condiments may be bartered for condiments but by no means salt for other condiments cooked food may be exchanged for other kinds of cooked food and sesamum seeds for grain in equal quantities
a kshatriya who has fallen into distress may subsist by all these means but he must never arrogantly adopt the mode of life prescribed for his betters
a man of low caste who through covetousness lives by the occupations of a higher one the king shall deprive of his property and banish
it is better to discharge ones own appointed duty incompletely than to perform completely that of another for he who lives according to the law of another caste is instantly excluded from his own
a vaisya who is unable to subsist by his own duties may even maintain himself by a sudra s mode of life avoiding however acts forbidden to him and he should give it up when he is able to do so
but a sudra being unable to find service with the twicebom and threatened with the loss of his sons and wife through hunger may maintain himself by handicrafts
let him follow those mechanical occupations and those various practical arts by following which the twiceborn are best served
a brahmana who is distressed through a want of means of subsistence and pines with hunger but unwilling to adopt a vaisyas mode of life and resolved to follow his own prescribed path may act in the following manner
a brahmana who has fallen into distress may accept gifts from anybody for according to the law it is not possible to assert that anything pure can be sullied
by teaching by sacrificing for and by accepting gifts from despicable men brahmanas in distress commit not sin for they are as pure as fire and water
he who when in danger of losing his life accepts food from any person whatsoever is no more tainted by sin than the sky by mud
agigarta who suffered hunger approached in order to slay his own son and was not tainted by sin since he only sought a remedy against famishing
vamadeva who well knew right and wrong did not sully himself when tormented by hunger he desired to eat the flesh of a dog in order to save his life
bharadvaga a performer of great austerities accepted many cows from the carpenter bribu when he was starving together with his sons in a lonely forest
visvamitra who well knew what is right or wrong approached when he was tormented by hunger to eat the haunch of a dog receiving it the hands of a kandala
on comparing the acceptance of gifts from low men sacrificing for them and teaching them the acceptance of gifts is the meanest of those acts and most reprehensible for a brahmana on account of its results in the next life
for assisting in sacrifices and teaching are two acts always performed for men who have received the sacraments but the acceptance of gifts takes place even in case the giver is a sudra of the lowest class
the guilt incurred by offering sacrifices for teaching unworthy men is removed by muttering sacred texts and by burnt offerings but that incurred by accepting gifts from them by throwing the gifts away and by austerities
a brahmana who is unable to maintain himself should rather glean ears or grains from the field of any man gleaning ears is better than accepting gifts picking up single grains is declared to be still more laudable
if brahmanas who are snatakas are pining with hunger or in want of utensils made of common metals or of other property they may ask the king for them if he is not disposed to be liberal he must be left
the acceptance on an untilled field is less blamable than that of a tilled one with respect to cows goats sheep gold grain and cooked food the acceptance of each earliernamed article is less blamable than of the following ones
there are seven lawful modes of acquiring property viz inheritance finding or friendly donation purchase conquest lending at interest the performance of work and the acceptance of gifts from virtuous men
learning mechanical arts work for wages service rearing cattle traffic agriculture contentment with little alms and receiving interest on money are the ten modes of subsistence permitted to all men in times of distress
neither a brahmana nor a kshatriya must lend money at interest but at his pleasure either of them may in times of distress when he requires money for sacred purposes lend to a very sinful man at a small interest
a kshatriya king who in times of distress takes even the fourth part of the crops is free from guilt if he protects his subjects to the best of his ability
his peculiar duty is conquest and he must not turn back in danger having protected the vaisyas by his weapons he may cause the legal tax to be collected
viz from vaisyas oneeighth as the tax on grain onetwentieth on the profits on gold and cattle which amount at least to one karshapana sudras artisans and mechanics shall benefit the king by doing work for him
if a sudra unable to subsist by serving brahmanas seeks a livelihood he may serve kshatriyas or he may also seek to maintain himself by attending on a wealthy vaisya
but let a sudra serve brahmanas either for the sake of heaven or with a view to both this life and the next for he who is called the servant of a brahmana thereby gains all his ends
the service of brahmanas alone is declared to be an excellent occupation for a sudra for whatever else besides this he may perform will bear him no fruit
they must allot to him out of their own family property a suitable maintenance after considering his ability his industry and the number of those whom he is bound to support
the remnants of their food must be given to him as well as their old clothes the refuse of their grain and their old household furniture
a sudra cannot commit an offence causing loss of caste pataka and he is not worthy to receive the sacraments he has no right to fulfil the sacred law of the aryans yet there is no prohibition against his fulfilling certain portions of the law
sudras who are desirous to gain merit and know their duty commit no sin but gain praise if they imitate the practice of virtuous men without reciting sacred texts
the more a sudra keeping himself free from envy imitates the behaviour of the virtuous the more he gains without being censured exaltation in this world and the next
no collection of wealth must be made by a sudra even though he be able to do it for a sudra who has acquired wealth gives pain to brahmanas
the duties of the four castes varna in times of distress have thus been declared and if they perform them well they will reach the most blessed state
thus all the legal rules for the four castes have been proclaimed i next will promulgate the auspicious rules for penances
o sinless one the whole sacred law applicable to the four castes has been declared by thee communicate to us now according to the truth the ultimate retribution for their deeds
to the great sages who addressed him thus righteous bhrigu sprung from manu answered hear the decision concerning this whole connexion with actions
action which springs from the mind from speech and from the body produces either good or evil results by action are caused the various conditions of men the highest the middling and the lowest
know that the mind is the instigator here below even to that action which is connected with the body and which is of three kinds has three locations and falls under ten heads
coveting the property of others thinking in ones heart of what is undesirable and adherence to false doctrines are the three kinds of sinful mental action
abusing others speaking untruth detracting from the merits of all men and talking idly shall be the four kinds of evil verbal action
taking what has not been given injuring creatures without the sanction of the law and holding criminal intercourse with another mans wife are declared to be the three kinds of wicked bodily action
a man obtains the result of a good or evil mental act in his mind that of a verbal act in his speech that of a bodily act in his body
in consequence of many sinful acts committed with his body a man becomes in the next birth something inanimate in consequence of sins committed by speech a bird or a beast and in consequence of mental sins he is rebom in a low caste
that man is called a true tridandin in whose mind these three the control over his speech vagdanda the control over his thoughts manodanda and the control over his body kayadanda are firmly fixed
that man who keeps this threefold control over himself with respect to all created beings and wholly subdues desire and wrath thereby assuredly gains complete success
him who impels this corporeal self to action they call the kshetragna the knower of the field but him who does the acts the wise name the bhutatman the self consisting of the elements
another internal self that is generated with all embodied kshetragnas is called giva through which the kshetragna becomes sensible of all pleasure and pain in successive births
these two the great one and the kshetragna who are closely united with the elements pervade him who resides in the multiform created beings
from his body innumerable forms go forth which constantly impel the multiform creatures to action
another strong body formed of particles of the five elements and destined to suffer the torments in hell is produced after death in the case of wicked men
when the evildoers by means of that body have suffered there the torments imposed by yama its constituent parts are united each according to its class with those very elements from which they were taken
he having suffered for his faults which are produced by attachment to sensual objects and which result in misery approaches free from stains those two mighty ones
those two together examine without tiring the merit and the guilt of that individual soul united with which it obtains bliss or misery both in this world and the next
if the soul chiefly practises virtue and vice to a small degree it obtains bliss in heaven clothed with those very elements
but if it chiefly cleaves to vice and to virtue in a small degree it suffers deserted by the elements the torments inflicted by yama
the individual soul having endured those torments of yama again enters free from taint those very five elements each in due proportion
let man having recognised even by means of his intellect these transitions of the individual soul which depend on merit and demerit always fix his heart on the acquisition of merit
know goodness sattva activity ragas and darkness tamas to be the three qualities of the self with which the great one always completely pervades all existences
when one of these qualities wholly predominates in a body then it makes the embodied soul eminently distinguished for that quality
goodness is declared to have the form erf knowledge darkness of ignorance activity of love and hatred such is the nature of these three which is all pervading and clings to everything created
when man experiences in his soul a feeling full of bliss a deep calm as it were and a pure light then let him know that it is among those three the quality called goodness
what is mixed with pain and does not give satisfaction to the soul one may know to be the quality of activity which is difficult to conquer and which ever draws embodied souls towards sensual objects
what is coupled with delusion what has the character of an undiscernible mass what cannot be fathomed by reasoning what cannot be fully known one must consider as the quality of darkness
will moreover fully describe the results which arise from these three qualities the excellent ones the middling ones and the lowest
the study of the vedas austerity the pursuit of knowledge purity control over the organs the performance of meritorious acts and meditation on the soul are the marks of the quality of goodness
delighting in undertakings want of firmness commission of sinful acts and continual indulgence in sensual pleasures are the marks of the quality of activity
covetousness sleepiness pusillanimity cruelty atheism leading an evil life a habit of soliciting favours and inattentiveness are the marks of the quality of darkness
know moreover the following to be a brief description of the three qualities each in its order as they appear in the three times the present past and future
when a man having done doing or being about to do any act feels ashamed the learned may know that all such acts bear the mark of the quality of darkness
but when a man desires to gain by an act much fame in this world and feels no sorrow on failing know that it bears the mark of the quality of activity
but that bears the mark of the quality of goodness which with his whole heart he desires to know which he is not ashamed to perform and at which his soul rejoices
the craving after sensual pleasures is declared to be the mark of darkness the pursuit of wealth the mark of activity the desire to gain spiritual merit the mark of goodness each later named quality is better than the preceding one
will briefly declare in due order what transmigrations in this whole world a man obtains through each of these qualities
those endowed with goodness reach the state of gods those endowed with activity the state of men and those endowed with darkness ever sink to the condition of beasts that is the threefold course of transmigrations
but know this threefold course of transmigrations that depends on the three qualities to be again threefold low middling and high according to the particular nature of the acts and of the knowledge of each man
immovable beings insects both small and great fishes snakes and tortoises cattle and wild animals are the lowest conditions to which the quality of darkness leads
elephants horses sudras and despicable barbarians lions tigers and boars are the middling states caused by the quality of darkness
karanas supamas and hypocrites rakshasas and pisakas belong to the highest rank of conditions among those produced by darkness
ghallas mallas natas men who subsist by despicable occupations and those addicted to gambling and drinking form the lowest order of conditions caused by activity
kings and kshatriyas the domestic priests of kings and those who delight in the warfare of disputations constitute the middling rank of the states caused by activity
the gandharvas the guhyakas and the servants of the gods likewise the apsarases belong all to the highest rank of conditions produced by activity
hermits ascetics brahmanas the crowds of the vaimanika deities the lunar mansions and the daityas form the first and lowest rank of the existences caused by goodness
sacrificers the sages the gods the vedas the heavenly lights the years the manes and the sadhyas constitute the second order of existences caused by goodness
the sages declare brahma the creators of the universe the law the great one and the undiscemible one to constitute the highest order of beings produced by goodness
thus the result of the threefold action the whole system of transmigrations which consists of three classes each with three subdivisions and which includes all created beings has been fully pointed out
in consequence of attachment to the objects of the senses and in consequence of the nonperformance of their duties fools the lowest of men reach the vilest births
what wombs this individual soul enters in this world and in consequence of what actions learn the particulars of that at large and in due order
those who committed mortal sins mahapataka having passed during large numbers of years through dreadful hells obtain after the expiration of that term of punishment the following births
the slayer of a brahmana enters the womb of a dog a pig an ass a camel a cow a goat a sheep a deer a bird a kandala and a pukkasa
a brahmana who drinks the spirituous liquor called sura shall enter the bodies of small and large insects of moths of birds feeding on ordure and of destructive beasts
a brahmana who steals the gold of a brahmana shall pass a thousand times through the bodies of spiders snakes and lizards of aquatic animals and of destructive pisakas
the violator of a gurus bed enters a hundred times the forms of grasses shrubs and creepers likewise of carnivorous animals and of beasts with fangs and of those doing cruel deeds
men who delight in doing hurt become carnivorous animals those who eat forbidden food worms thieves creatures consuming their own kind those who have intercourse with women of the lowest castes pretas
he who has associated with outcasts he who has approached the wives of other men and he who has stolen the property of a brahmana become brahmarakshasas
a man who out of greed has stolen gems pearls or coral or any of the many other kinds of precious things is bom among the goldsmiths
for stealing grain a man becomes a rat for stealing yellow metal a hamsa for stealing water a plava for stealing honey a stinging insect for stealing milk a crow for stealing condiments a dog for stealing clarified butter an ichneumon
for stealing meat a vulture for stealing fat a cormorant for stealing oil a winged animal of the kind called tailapaka for stealing salt a cricket for stealing sour milk a bird of the kind called balaka
for stealing silk a partridge for stealing linen a frog for stealing cottoncloth a crane for stealing a cow an iguana for stealing molasses a flying fox
for stealing fine perfumes a muskrat for stealing vegetables consisting of leaves a peacock for stealing cooked food of various kinds a porcupine for stealing uncooked food a hedgehog
for stealing fire he becomes a heron for stealing householdutensils a masonwasp for stealing dyed clothes a francolinpartridge
for stealing a deer or an elephant a wolf for stealing a horse a tiger for stealing fruit and roots a monkey for stealing a woman a bear for stealing water a black white cuckoo for stealing vehicles a camel for stealing cattle a hegoat
that man who has forcibly taken away any kind of property belonging to another or who has eaten sacrificial food of which no portion had been offered inevitably becomes an animal
women also who in like manner have committed a theft shall incur guilt they will become the females of those same creatures which have been enumerated above
but men of the four castes who have relinquished without the pressure of necessity their proper occupations will become the servants of dasyus after migrating into despicable bodies
a brahmana who has fallen off from his duty becomes an ulkamukha preta who feeds on what has been vomited and a kshatriya a kataputana preta who eats impure substances and corpses
a vaisya who has fallen off from his duty becomes a maitrakshagyotika preta who feeds on pus and a sudra a kailasaka preta who feeds on moths
in proportion as sensual men indulge in sensual pleasures in that same proportion their taste for them grows
by repeating their sinful acts those men of small understanding suffer pain here below in various births
the torture of being tossed about in dreadful hells tamisra and the rest that of the forest with swordleaved trees and the like and that of being bound and mangled
and various torments the pain of being devoured by ravens and owls the heat of scorching sand and the torture of being boiled in jars which is hard to bear
and births in the wombs of despicable beings which cause constant misery and afflictions from cold and heat and terrors of various kinds
the pain of repeatedly lying in various wombs and agonizing births imprisonment in fetters hard to bear and the misery of being enslaved by others
and separations from their relatives and dear ones and the pain of dwelling together with the wicked labour in gaining wealth and its loss trouble in making friends and the appearance of enemies
old age against which there is no remedy the pangs of diseases afflictions of many various kinds and finally unconquerable death
but with whatever disposition of mind a man forms any act he reaps its result in a future body endowed with the same quality
all the results proceeding from actions have been thus pointed out learn next those acts which secure supreme bliss to a brahmana
studying the veda practising austerities the acquisition of true knowledge the subjugation of the organs abstention from doing injury and serving the guru are the best means for attaining supreme bliss
if you ask whether among all these virtuous actions performed here below there be one which has been declared more efficacious than the rest for securing supreme happiness to man
the answer is that the knowledge of the soul is stated to be the most excellent among all of them for that is the first of all sciences because immortality is gained through that
among those six kinds of actions enumerated above the performance of the acts taught in the veda must ever be held to be most efficacious for ensuring happiness in this world and the next
for in the performance of the acts prescribed by the veda all those others are fully comprised each in its turn in the several rules for the rites
the acts prescribed by the veda are of two kinds such as procure an increase of happiness and cause a continuation of mundane existence pravritta and such as ensure supreme bliss and cause a cessation of mundane existence nivritta
acts which secure the fulfilment of wishes in this world or in the next are called pravritta such as cause a continuation of mundane existence but acts performed without any desire for a reward preceded by the acquisition of true knowledge are declared to be nivritta such as cause the cessation of mundane existence
he who sedulously performs acts leading to future births pravritta becomes equal to the gods but he who is intent on the performance of those causing the cessation of existence nivritta indeed passes beyond the reach of the five elements
he who sacrifices to the self alone equally recognising the self in all created beings and all created beings in the self becomes independent like an autocrat and selfluminous
after giving up even the abovementioned sacrificial rites a brahmana should exert himself in acquiring the knowledge of the soul in extinguishing his passions and in studying the veda
for that secures the attainment of the object of existence especially in the case of a brahmana because by attaining that not otherwise a twicebom man has gained all his ends
the veda is the eternal eye of the manes gods and men the vedaordinance is both beyond the sphere of human power and beyond the sphere of human comprehension that is a certain fact
all those traditions smriti and those despicable systems of philosophy which are not based on the veda produce no reward after death for they are declared to be founded on darkness
all those doctrines differing from the veda which spring up and soon perish are worthless and false because they are of modern date
the four castes the three worlds the four orders the past the present and the future are all severally known by means of the veda
sound touch colour taste and fifthly smell are known through the veda alone their production is through the vedic rites which in this respect are secondary acts
the eternal lore of the veda upholds all created beings hence i hold that to be supreme which is the means of securing happiness to these creatures
command of armies royal authority the office of a judge and sovereignty over the whole world he only deserves who knows the vedascience
as a fire that has gained strength consumes even trees full of sap even so he who knows the veda bums out the taint of his soul which arises from evil acts
in whatever order a man who knows the true meaning of the vedascience may dwell he becomes even while abiding in this world fit for the union with brahman
even forgetful students of the sacred books are more distinguished than the ignorant those who remember them surpass the forgetful students those who possess a knowledge of the meaning are more distinguished than those who only remember the words men who follow the teaching of the texts surpass those who merely know their meaning
austerity and sacred learning are the best means by which a brahmana secures supreme bliss by austerities he destroys guilt by sacred learning he obtains the cessation of births and deaths
the three kinds of evidence perception inference and the sacred institutes which comprise the tradition of many schools must be fully understood by him who desires perfect correctness with respect to the sacred law
he alone and no other man knows the sacred law who explores the utterances of the sages and the body of the laws by modes of reasoning not repugnant to the vedalore
thus the acts which secure supreme bliss have been exactly and fully described now the secret portion of these institutes proclaimed by manu will be taught
if it be asked how it should be with respect to points of the law which have not been specially mentioned the answer is that which brahmanas who are sishtas propound shall doubtlessly have legal force
those brahmanas must be considered as sishtas who in accordance with the sacred law have studied the veda together with its appendages and are able to adduce proofs perceptible by the senses from the revealed texts
whatever an assembly consisting either of at least ten or of at least three persons who follow their prescribed occupations declares to be law the legal force of that one must not dispute
three persons who each know one of the three principal vedas a logician a mimamsaka one who knows the nirukta one who recites the institutes of the sacred law and three men belonging to the first three orders shall constitute a legal assembly consisting of at least ten members
one who knows the rigveda one who knows the yagurveda and one who knows the samaveda shall be known to form an assembly consisting of at least three members and competent to decide doubtful points of law
even that which one brahmana versed in the veda declares to be law must be considered to have supreme legal force but not that which is proclaimed by myriads of ignorant men
even if thousands of brahmanas who have not fulfilled their sacred duties are unacquainted with the veda and subsist only by the name of their caste meet they cannot form an assembly for settling the sacred law
the sin of him whom dunces incarnations of darkness and unacquainted with the law instruct in his duty falls increased a hundredfold on those who propound it
all that which is most efficacious for securing supreme bliss has been thus declared to you a brahmana who does not fall off from that obtains the most excellent state
thus did that worshipful deity disclose to me through a desire of benefiting mankind this whole most excellent secret of the sacred law
let every brahmana concentrating his mind fully recognise in the self all things both the real and the unreal for he who recognises the universe in the self does not give his heart to unrighteousness
the self alone is the multitude of the gods the universe rests on the self for the self produces the connexion of these embodied spirits with actions
let him meditate on the ether as identical with the cavities of the body on the wind as identical with the organs of motions and of touch on the most excellent light as the same with his digestive organs and his sight on water as the same with the corporeal fluids on the earth as the same with the solid parts of his body
on the moon as one with the internal organ on the quarters of the horizon as one with his sense of hearing on vishnu as one with his power of motion on hara as the same with his strength on agni fire as identical with his speech on mitra as identical with his excretions and on pragapati as one with his organ of generation
let him know the supreme male purusha to be the sovereign ruler of them all smaller even than small bright like gold and perceptible by the intellect only when in a state of sleep like abstraction
some call him agni fire others manu the lord of creatures others indra others the vital air and again others eternal brahman
he pervades all created beings in the five forms and constantly makes them by means of birth growth and decay revolve like the wheels of a chariot
he who thus recognises the self through the self in all created beings becomes equal minded towards all and enters the highest state brahman
a twiceborn man who recites these institutes revealed by manu will be always virtuous in conduct and will reach whatever condition he desires
the invincible and selfpossessed rama entered the great forest of dandaka and saw there a multitude of hermitages of the ascetics
they the hermitages were strewn all over with kusa grass and robes by bark with auspicious sacrificial materials around and hence dazzling like the orb of the sun in the sky difficult to gaze
the courtyards of the hermitages were cleanswept sprinkled with water and decorated they provided shelter to all kinds of creatures and were filled all over with flocks of birds and antelopes
the hermitages looked glorified with dances by celestial damsels they were adorned with vast fire sanctuaries ladles for sacrificial ceremonies deerskins and kusa grass faggots for pots of water roots and fruits they looked delightful with huge sacred trees of the forest laden with sweet fruits
the hermitages where various sacrificial offerings were made reverberated with vedic chantings flowers were scattered all over there was a lotuspond with lotuses there were aged selfrestrained sages glowing like the sun or the fire living on fruits and roots clothed in bark and dark deerskin
the hermitages echoing with the sounds of vedic recitations and resembling the very abode of brahma were adorned with great holy sages living on regulated diet
the illustrious effulgent rama saw groups of hermitages adorned with venerable brahmins with knowledge of the supreme spirit on seeing them he loosened the string of his great bow and went forward
on seeing rama with illustrious sita the great sages richly endowed with divine knowledge went forward to greet him
the sages steadfast in their vows saw rama who was shining like the rising moon lakshmana and the famed sita went forward and received them with words of benediction
those sages living in the forest were wonderstruck to see the handsome graceful delicate and welldressed rama
all the foresters looked at the wonderful figures of rama sita and lakshmana with unblinking eyes
ever engaged in the welfare of all beings the sages made rama their guest sit in their leafy hut
the great sages comparable to the firegod and followers of righteousness honoured rama according to tradition by offering water
the sages who were knowers of dharma saluted the noble rama offered fruits roots and flowers available at the hermitage and with folded palms said thus
o king of great reputation you are the refuge of the people a protector of dharma a chastiser of wrongdoers a worshipful and respectable preceptor
o rama in this world a king is considered the fourth part of indra as he protects the people therefore he is respected and he enjoys the choicest pleasures of life
since we are the residents of your territory we deserve to be protected by you whether you live in the city or in the forest you are the lord of the people and our king
o king we have conquered our anger and have controlled our senses we ascetics have cast aside all our authority we are like your children and need to be protected by you forever
having said so the ascetics offered with reverence fruits roots flowers and other forest products to rama and lakshmana
after receiving hospitality from the sages rama took of all of them at sunrise and entered deep into the forest
with lakshmana following rama went through the forest filled with herds of animals and inhabited by bears and tigers it was a place where trees creepers and bushes were crushed by frequent visits of demons it was difficult to locate a water source and it resounded with the chirping of various birds and insects crickets
while rama along with sita was wandering in the forest infested with dreadful animals he saw a roaring cannibal resembling the peak of a mountain
he was of dreadful appearance with deep eyes a huge face and a big belly he looked tall ugly and frightening
wearing a tigerskin he resembled the god of death with a wide open mouth wet with marrow and drenched with blood he struck terror into all beings
roaring loudly he carried an iron spit in which were pierced three lions four tigers two wolves ten deer and the huge head of an elephant with its tusks smeared with the fat of flesh
looking extremely furious he ran towards rama lakshmana and sita like the god of death rushes towards the dying people
making a dreadful sound as if shaking the earth he took sita on his lap stepped aside and said
you both clad in bark and wearing matted hair holding bows arrows and swords have entered into the dandaka forest with your wife your life has been cut short indeed
how is it that you both dressed in the robes of ascetics live with a woman leading an unrighteous and sinful life who are you who have brought disgrace to the ascetic discipline
i am a demon named viradha i move in this dense forest with my weapons eating the flesh of the sages
this woman of fine hips shall be my wife you sinners i shall drink the blood of both of you in the fight
sita daughter of janaka was bewildered out of fear when she heard the cruel and boastful words of that wicked viradha
seeing the auspicious sita in the lap of viradha shaken out of anxiety like a plantain tree in a strong wind rama with his throat parched said to lakshmana
gentle lakshmana see the illustrious daughter ofjanaka a lady of good conduct brought up in utmost comfort caught in the lap of viradha
o lakshmana whatever kaikeyi desired through her boons has now come true so soon
kaikeyi my middle mother is farsighted indeed not content with the kingdom alone see sent me beloved of all beings away to the forest let her cherished desire be fulfilled
o lakshmana nothing is more sorrowful to me than the touch of vaidehi by another it is more painful to me than the death of my father or loss of my kingdom
as rama was thus full of tears of sorrow lakshmana sighed heavily in anger like a hissing serpant in confinement and said
o rama you are like indra lord of all beings what makes you feel sad like an orphan when i am at your service like a servant
the earth will drink the blood of viradha with his life gone slain by my angry arrow
like indra who hits the mountain with his thunderbolt i shall release on viradha the anger i felt against bharata for his passion for the kingdom
spurred by the speed of my strong arms my arrow will fall on his broad chest and separate his life from his body then his body reeling round and round will fall on the ground     thus ends the second sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
graceful lakshmana asked viradha with a smile who are you wandering in the forest at will
then viradha with his voice filling the forest said instead of asking about me you both should speak out who you are and where you are going
questioned by the demon who bore a burning countenance the highly effulgent rama introduced his ikshvaku family
know us to be both kshatriyas endowed with a good lineage and yet moving in the forest we both wish to know who you are and why you are going about in dandaka forest
then viradha said to rama whose truth was his strength i will tell you who i am o listen
i am indeed son to jaya my mother is satahrada verily all the demons on this earth call me viradha
by the grace of lord brahma i was bestowed with this prowess through my penance in this world none can kill me with a weapon nor split nor cut me to pieces
therefore leave this lady and run away to the place you came from i will not take away your life
with eyes reddened with anger rama replied to the sinful deformed viradha
o vile mean creature surely you are seeking death wait you will meet it in the fight
then rama strung his bow immediately shot the sharp arrows at viradha and hit him verily
from his bow strung tight rama shot seven swift goldenfeathered arrows comparable to garuda and the windgod in speed
the arrows tied with peacockfeathers looking like fire pierced the body of viradha which drenched in blood fell on the ground
hit by rama and lakshmana the enraged demon left vaidehi lifted a sharp spear and ran towards them
the demon who produced a great noise with his wide open mouth resembled the god of death he lifted a sharp spike that looked like indras banner
and then both the brothers showered bright arrows on the demon viradha who looked like yama the god of death
the demon who was extremely frightening stood there laughing and yawning as he yawned all the swiftlyflying arrows fell out of his body
by virtue of a boon viradha the demon controlled the vital breath of his body by a mere touch and raising the spike ran towards the two raghava princes
with two arrows rama the best among wielders of weapons broke down the spike in the sky burning like fire and resembling the thunderbolt of indra
the spike broken down by ramas arrow fell like a slab of mount meru splintered by indras thunder
then both rama and lakshmana quickly raised their swords which looked like black serpents and at once fell upon the demon who was going to strike with great force
struck down the angry demon tightly caught hold of both of them under his arms and wanted to set out carrying rama and lakshmana the two unshakeable tigers among men
rama understood the intention of the demon and said to lakshmana let him go his way no need to stop him
o lakshmana let the nightstalker go the way he wishes that is in fact our path
puffed up with his own great strength viradha lifted them and placed them on his shoulders as though they were two children
then the nightstalker proceeded towards the forest carrying both the scions of the raghu race on his shouldersroaring
seeing those two mightyarmed rama and lakshmana being carried away by viradha sita started crying loudly
the wild bears tigers and panthers will eat me up here o best among demons pray take me and leave both the kakutsthas
on hearing those words of sita both the heroes rama and lakshmana hastened to kill the wicked viradha
lakshmana quickly broke the left and rama the right shoulder of that dreadful demon
with both shoulders broken the demon looking like a cloud huge and dark fell at once on the ground like a mountain split by a thunderbolt
striking the demon with fists knees and feet both of them smit him on the bare ground and pulverized him
although pierced by arrows and wounded by the two swords and pulverized on the ground the demon did not die
seeing the mountainlike viradha not dying though seriously wounded illustrious rama guaranter of safety from fear said to lakshmana
o lakshmana best among men this demon by virtue of his penance cannot be killed with any weapon in war therefore let us bury him
dig a deep pit to bury this demon dreadful like an elephant and emitting a fearful glow
courageous rama standing there put his foot firmly on the neck of viradha and said to lakshmana dig up a crevice
when the demon viradha heard rama saying so he said these humble words to the scion of the kakutsthas and the best of men
you have killed me o rama a tiger among men you are equal to indra in prowess o best of men out of delusion i could not recognise you earlier
o dear rama i know now you are the blessed son of kausalya sita is a noble lady and a glorious soul
i am tumburu by name a celestial singer of the gandharva clan cursed by kubera i got this dreadful body of a demon
when i appealed to him that lord of great fame kubera said that i would get back my original form and ascend to heaven when rama son of dasaratha would kill me in a duel
when king kubera saw me absent from duty as i was infatuated with rambha he got angry and cursed me
o scorcher of enemies by your grace i am rid of the curse delivered from my dreadful form i will now go to my world may both of you fare well
o dear there lives sarabhanga a righteous sage comparable to the sun at a distance of one and a half yojanas from here go to him at once he will bless you with your wellbeing
bury me in the pit o rama and proceed happily this is a great tradition for the dead demons those who are buried in the pit attain heaven
having said so to rama the mighty viradha hit by the arrows left his body and attained heaven
when rama heard those words he said o lakshmana dig for this elephantlike demon of dreadful acts a big pit having said so the mighty rama stood firmly stamping the neck of viradha with his foot
then lakshmana fetched a spade and dug a sufficiently big pit by the side of the great soul viradha
rama took his foot off viradhas neck and dropped his body with pointed ears into the pit while viradha was groaning fearfully
rama and lakshmana stable and firm brave and quick together lifted the body of viradha who was fierce in battle and roaring and forcibly threw it into the pit with joy
the two princes bulls among men who were adept in archery saw that the great demon could not be killed by any other means they reflected over the issue and undertook the task of killing him with sharp weapons and buried him in a pit
rama deliberately wanted to kill viradha with weapons viradha the forestranger himself revealed that it was not possible to kill him with weapons and asked rama to bury him in a pit
while rama who had made up his mind after hearing him was putting the mighty demon in the pit the forest rang with his roar
rama and lakshmana were happy to consign viradhas body to the pit after killing him they filled the pit with rocks in the great forest without fear
on killing viradha the demon of terrific strength heroic rama embraced sita consoled her and said to his brother lakshmana glowing like fire
this wild forest with which we have not been acquainted earlier is difficult to pass hence let us proceed quickly to sage sarabhanga
rama went to the hermitage of sarabhanga a sage with divine grace who had realised the supreme by his penance thus by the side of the sage he witnessed a huge wonder
rama saw the lord of the gods indra in the sky getting off the chariot with his body shining brightly like the sun or the fire followed by the gods his feet untouched by the earth clad in spotless attire and adorned with shining ornaments he was being worshipped by many greatsouls like him
not far from that place rama saw a chariot yoked with tawnycoloured horses shining like the morning sun it looked like a palewhite cloud resembling the lunar orb
rama saw a pure white umbrella with a highly expensive golden staff decorated with variegated flower garlandswhile near his indras head stood a pair of exquisite ladies with fans made of yaks tail
many celestial singers of heaven gods great sages and siddhas sang with the choicest words the glory of this god stationed in the sky
while indra was conversing with sarabhanga rama saw him and said to lakshmana
pointing at the chariot rama said lakshmana see this wonderful effulgent chariot endowed with grace is shining like the sun in the sky
the horses of indra who is often invoked during sacrificial rituals and about whom we have heard earlier are now stationed in the sky
o lakshmana around the chariot stand hundreds of finest young men of about twentyfive years clad in red robes they are wearing earrings and holding swords in their hands they have broad chests and stout arms like iron beams like tigers they are difficult to overpower they have necklaces hanging on their chests blazing like fire
these tigers among men have cheerful countenacess from which it can be deduced that the age of the gods always remains constant
lakshmana stay here with sita awhile until i ascertain who this dazzling being on the chariot is
instructing lakshmana to wait rama went towards sarabhangas hermitage
then indra husband of sachi having seen rama coming towards him approached sarabhanga and said this to him privately
here comes rama before he talks to me take me to some other place from where he may not be able to see me he has to do a great task which is difficult for others i can see him when he accomplishes the taste and emerges victorious
this way honouring the sage indra wielder of the thunderbolt took leave of him and went to heaven in his chariot harressed with horses
when indra departed like that rama with his retinue sita and lakshmana went to sarabhanga who was sitting by the side of the firealtar for agnihotra
rama sita and lakshmana prostrated at sarabhangas feet after being permitted to sit they were invited to stay there
thereafter on ramas query sarabhanga told him all about indras visit
o rama indra the bestower of boons wants to take me to the world of brahma earned by me through severe penance which is most difficult to be attained by those devoid of selfrealisation
o rama the best among men you are a very dear guest to me and knowing that you are near i will not go to the world of brahman without seeing you
o rama the best of men only after seeing a great virtuous soul like you shall i go to heaven the abode of the gods
o tiger among men i have conquered heavenly abodes as well as the imperishable auspicious worlds of brahma accept them all that are mine obtained through my penance
to these words of sage sarabhanga rama the best of men the knower of all sastras the scion of the raghus replied
o great sage i will earn all the worlds myself if you direct me but i need a proper dwellingplace in this forest
to this request of rama who was equal to indra in strength sagacious sarabhanga said these words
here dwells in this forest a brilliant saint righteous and selfcontrolled sutikshna by name who will look to your welfare o rama
you may approach sage sutikshna residing in a sacred spot he will provide you a delightful place for your stay in the forest
proceed o rama in the reverse direction of the river mandakini carrying flowers and floats and you will reach the place
o rama the best among men this is the way look at me for a while my dear until i shed my limbs just as a snake sheds its withered slough
then the effulgent sarabhanga knower of mantras magical spells kindled the fire with faggots and after offering oblations of ghee plunged in
then were consumed that highsouled sarabhangas hair on the body and on the head the wornout skin the bones and flesh along with blood
sarabhanga then emerged youthful from that heap of fire shining like a flame and looking very elegant
sarabhanga then went beyond the worlds of the gods of the great sages who constantly kindle sacrificial fire and ascended to the world of brahman
sarabhanga performer of sacred deeds saw brahma with his followers brahma also seeing sarabhanga the best among the brahmins welcomed him gladly      thus ends the fifth sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
when sarabhanga attained the heaven all the sages collected together and came to rama whose radiance was like fire
vaikhanasas valakhilyas sages who continuously wash their bodies marichakas asmakuttas sages who live on leaves only those who have teeth like mortar unmajjakas those who use limbs as their bed those who practise penance without using a bed those who do penance in the open unmindful of rain or sun or wind those who live on water only those who penance under the open sky those who carry on penance on high places like the mountaintop those who recline on bare ground only those who observe fast as a part of religious tradition those selfrestrained men those who mutter sacred mantras those who constantly perform penance and those who stand under the blazing sun in summer placing fire on four sides while performing penanceall these types of sages met rama in the hermitage of sarabhanga
all groups of sages who knew dharma and were upholders of righteousness reached rama the supreme knower of dharma and said
o great charioteer you are the lord of the ikshvaku race and of the world just like indra chief among the gods
you are renowned in the three worlds for your valour for your devotion to father and in you lies enough evidence of your adherence to truth and righteousness
o lord do excuse us we sought your help to fulfil our needs since you are at hand you are a great soul knower and lover of dharma
o lord a king who collect one sixth of the produce as tax and yet does not protect his subjects like his children commits an act of grave injustice
o rama whoever protects the inhabitants of his kingdom at all times like his own son who he loves more than his own life will attain the world of brahma and remain there for long years and will achieve prosperity thereafter
one fourth of the supreme merit a sage earns by living on fruits and roots accrues to the king through which the people are protected righteously
o rama we are a group of great sages mostly brahmins leading a vanaprastha life yet with a protector like you we are slaughtered in large numbers like orphans
come and see the bodies of ascetics who had perceived the supreme spirit killed in large numbers in the forest by the fierce demons
a great slaughter is taking place amongst those residing on the bank of the pampa lake near the river mandakini and on mount chitrakuta
we ascetics are not able to tolerate the fearful deeds perpetrated by the dreadful demons in the forest
o rama you are worthy of refuge hence we have come to you seeking your protection we are being killed by the nightstalkers save us
o great warrior here on this earth there is no protector as mighty as you so o prince save us all from these demons
having heard this righteous rama of the kakutstha dynasty said to all the ascetics engaged in penance
you should not speak to me this way i deserve to be commanded by the ascetics i have not entered this forest only on a personal mission
i came into this forest in obedience to my fathers orders to repel the aggression of demons against you
i came here to acomplish your task incidentally therefore my stay in the forest will yield great results
i wish to kill in the fight the demons who are your enemies o great ascetics you may witness my prowess supported by my brother
brave rama steadfast in righteousness worthy of honour gave assurance to protect the ascetics endowed with the wealth of penance and proceeded towards sage sutikshna     thus ends the sixth sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
rama the scorcher of enemies along with his brother lakshmana and sita and the sages went to sutikshnas hermitage
after covering a long distance and crossing the river ganga with plenty of water rama saw a huge mountain looking like a lofty cloud
rama and lakshmana the best of the ikshvaku family accompanied by sita entered the dense forest filled with trees all over
entering that dreadful forest they saw trees full of flowers and fruits and a hermitage in a lonely place with lines of bark robes hanging
there at the hermitage was sutikshna an ascetic grown old with long penance wearing soiled matted locks and seated rama first addressed him as per custom
o venerable one i am ramayou are a great sage armed with truth as your prowess and a knower of dharma i have come to see you could you speak to me
thereafter the composed sutikshna looked at rama the best among righteous men and embracing him with both his arms said
o rama the best among the raghavas and among the upholders of truth you are welcome with your presence this hermitage will have a protector now
o renowned hero i had heard that you have come to chitrakuta renouncing your kingdom i have been waiting so long to see you here unable to give up this body i did not even leave the earth for heaven the world of the gods
o scion of the kakutstha family indra king of the gods came to me and said that by my meritorious deeds i have won all the worlds
along with your wife and lakshmana you may roam by my grace the worlds won by me and served by divine sages like devarsi narada
selfpossessed rama replied to the truthful ascetic who had performed intense penance just as kasyapa would address lord brahma
o great sage i will win all the worlds myself i only want to live in this forest allow me
you are ever engaged in the welfare of all beings i have heard this from the great sage sarabhanga of gautamas clan
thus addressed by rama sutikshna the great sage wellknown to the world was highly delighted he then said these sweet words
o rama this is a salubrious hermitage where hosts of sages live and which is full of roots and fruits you may enjoy yourself here
o illustrious rama herds of animals visit this place fearlessly enticing the inmates and then go back without harming any one
when heroic rama heard that there was no other problem from the wild animals except their frequent incursions he lifted his bow with an arrow and said these words
o reverend one i will kill with a sharpedged arrow glowing like a thunderbolt all those herds of animals who keep coming here
what can be more agonizing for you than my killing animals i therefore do not foresee our long stay in this hermitage
rama stopped with this and then the evening drew to a close offering his evening oblation he arranged for his stay along with sita and lakshmana in the delightful hermitage of sutikshna
seeing that the evening had passed and night had set in the great sage sutikshna with due hospitality served those best of men food fit for ascetics     thus ends the seventh sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
rama worshipped by sutikshna and accompanied by lakshmana spent the night at the hermitage and got up early in the morning
in the morning rama and sita got up in time and took bath in cool lilyfragrant water
and as per routine sinless sita rama and lakshmana offered prayers to the fire and other gods of the forest which was the refuge of the ascetics seeing the rising sun they worshipped him and approaching sutikshna said these soothing words
o revered sutikshna received by one so worshipworthy like you we spent the night well we nowtake leave of you the sages are hastening us
we wish to see the entire circle of hermitages of the sages residing in dandaka forest so we are in a hurry
we seek your permission to go with the great sages who are ever engaged in righteousness selfcontrolled by virtue of their penance and are like flameless fire
we wish to depart before the sun grows unbearably hot like the man devoid of good lineage who acquires wealth through unlawful means becomes arrogant thereafter rama along with sita and lakshmana offered worship at the feet of the venerable sage
when both rama and lakshmana touched the feet of sutikshna the best of the sages he lifted them up hugged them tightly and said affectionately
you may safely tread o rama this path along with lakshmana and sita who is following you like a shadow
o valient rama the sages living in the dandaka forest are self realised souls see how delightful is the location of their hermitages
you will see the beautiful forestareas with abundant fruits and roots flowers in full bloom herds of animals flocks of quiet birds tanks and lakes filled with clean waters and shining with fully blossomed lotuses resounding with waterducks and peacocks and waterfalls coming down the hills thus you will enjoy a delightful sylvan sight
o dear rama o lakshmana you may leave now you may have to come back to this hermitage after seeing those places
thus addressed rama scion of the kakutsthas along with lakshmana circumambulated the sage in reverence and set forth
thereafter largeeyed sita handed the brothers two quivers two bows as well as two excellent swords
both rama and lakshmana tied their auspicious quivers took the two twanging bows and departed from the hermitage
handsome rama and lakshmana glowing in their radiance held the bows and exited with sita     thus ends the eighth sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
while rama was leaving with the permission of sutikshna sita spoke these warm affectionate words to her husband
this great path of dharma you are following now can be attained only through subtle means by one free from addiction born of passion
there are three kinds of vices born out of lust first speaking untruth second having sexual relation with others wives and third resorting to violence with no enmity the later two vices are of serious nature
o rama you never spoke untruth in the past nor will you speak in future how can there be any desire in you to destroy the virtue of others wives
o rama lord among men you hadnt it lust for other women in the past you havnt it now never does it exist even in your mind
o prince you are always faithful to your wife you are righteous truthful and obedient to your fathers orders
o rama you are truthful honourable powerful o elder brother of lakshmana in you is established truth and righteousness
o longarmed one to contain all this is only possible for those who have conquered the senses o handsome one i know your ability to control the senses
but you are a victim to the third vice born of lust ie showing violence without cause for enmity
o valiant one you have promised to kill the demons in the battle in order to protect the sages residing in the dandaka forest
it is only on account of this that you entered the wellknown dandaka forest with your brother wielding bow and arrows
i am therefore worried in my mind when i see you here and think of your wellbeing i wish your ultimate good the next two lines appear more or less a repetition so omitted editor
o brave rama i do not like your going to dandaka forest i shall tell you the reason do listen
of course you will go to the forest with your brother holding the bow and arrows release the arrows when you see the forestrangers
a bow in the hand of a kshatriya is like fuel to fire it surely swells his strength and his brilliance
o mightyarmed one there dwelt in the past an ascetic noble and truthful in a sacred forest where animals and birds lived merrily together
once indra husband of sachi came to his hermitage in the guise of an attendant sword in hand in order to hinder his penance
then while the sage was practising penance at the hermitage he gave him that excellent sword to be kept in trust
having received the weapon as a trust the sage went wandering in the forest always attentive in safeguarding the weapon
vigilant about protecting the sword deposited with him the sage never moved without it even when he went gathering roots and fruits
while the sage moved about holding the weapon he gave up the practice of penance gradually and developed a violent mindset
by association with the sword he developed a violent attitude and in that habitual state of excitement he was dragged into unrighteous ways which ultimately took him to hell
contact with the weapon has led to this in the past like contact with fire it leads man to destruction i say this out of my love and reverence for you as a reminder and not as an instruction
while holding a bow you should not have the intention to kill demons residing in dandaka with no animosity against you o valiant one i do not desire that any one should be killed without incurring any offence
it is the duty of a kshatriya a warrior to protect with his bow those who practise selfcontrol penance in the forest in a state of panic
where is the question of wielding a weapon and living in the forest where is the life of a kshatriya and the life of penance for us this is an encroachment let the law of the land be honoured
lord when we handle the weapon the mind gets vitiated only after returning to ayodhya can you perform the duty of a kshatriya
you would have been on unlimited source of joy to my fatherinlaw and motherinlaw had you permanently renounced the kingdom for the life of an ascetic
righteousness brings wealth wealth brings happiness righteousness brings everything in fact the essence of the world is righteousness
the wise earn dharma through getting their bodies emaciated by carefully adopting different means of discipline selftorture happiness does not beget happiness
o gentle one you may move in this forest of ascetics with a pure mind the true meaning behind everything in these three worlds is known to you indeed
having heard these words spoken by sita who was devoted to her husband replied rama who was firm in righteousness
o daughter of janaka you are conversant with dharma whatever you have admonished out of affection for me is befitting your race
but permit me devi you have already stated when a kshatriya holds a bow there will be no cry of distress it means you approve of my holding a bow
o sita the sages who perform rigorous penance in dandaka forest came to me personally seeking shelter although they can be their own protection
the sages living in the forest eating roots and fruits and ever engaged in righteous activities are afraid of the depredations of the demons with their happiness gone
the sages engrossed in various austerities in the forest have been victims to the dreadful demons living on human flesh
the ascetics the best of brahmins living in dandaka forest being eaten up like that besought me to come to their rescue
on hearing the words that came from their mouth i bowed at their feet and said
be pleased that brahmins like you have approached me while i should have come to you has put me to shame immeasurable
i enquired about what i could do for them and all the brahmins in one voice said
o rama the demons who can assume any form at their will are mercilessly tormenting us in dandaka forest do protect us from them
o sinless one these cannibals are invincible they arrive at the time of our sacrificial rituals on the days of festivities or at the time of lunar conjunctions like no moon or full moon days and attack us
you are the supreme refuge for us ascetics tormented by demons helpless men in search of shelter
o rama it is difficult to perform penance which is ever full of obstacles therefore we do not pronounce curses even if eaten up by demons
the demons dwelling in the dandaka forest are tormenting us you alone are our lord in the forest do protect us with your brother
o daughter of janaka on hearing the words of the sages i promised to undertake the entire protection of sages of the dandaka forest
having promised the sages i cannot do otherwise as long as i have life in me to me truth is always dear
o sita i may forfeit my life forsake even lakshmana and you but will not break the promise made specially to the brahmins
even before the sages requested me i should have protected them what to speak of the promise i have already made
o sinless one all that has been said by you is out of your love and affection for me i am pleased what is harmful is never advised
your auspicious words are quite befitting your lineage you are the follower of my dharma and so dearer to me than my life
having said this to sita the princess of mithila rama along with lakshmana bow in hand moved about the delightful penancegrove     thus ends the tenth sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by the sage valmiki
rama walked in front sita with a beautiful waist in the middle and lakshmana holding the bow behind them
both rama and lakshmana walked on accompanied by sita watching several beautiful mountain ranges forests and rivers
watching the swans and ruddy geese on river banks and lakes full of lotuses and birds on water and in the sky
watching herds of deer intoxicated horned buffaloes wild boars and elephants who are enemies of trees elephants uproof trees
as the sun was setting they had covered a long distance watching a yojanalong tank adorned with lotuses and crowded with herds of elephants and flocks of cranes swans and aquatic animals
in that lake of clear waters they heard the sounds of songs and musical instruments while there were none around
out of curiosity mighty rama and lakshmana started enquiring about the matter from sage dharmabrata by name
o great sage this very wonderful sound has whetted our great curiosity if there is no top secret about this do disclose it
thus addressed by rama the righteous sage narrated the entire origin of the lake
o rama this lake called panchapsara filled with water at all times has been created through penance by a sage called mandakarni
great sage mandakarni standing in water and living on air performed rigorous penance for ten thousand years
thereafter very much perturbed all the gods led by agni gathered together at one place and started deliberating among themselves
the gods of heaven became agitated in their minds thinking the sage might usurp one of their places
all the gods then engaged five of the important nymphs glittering like lightning to disturb the penance of the sage
the sage a knower of the inner self and the world of plurality was gripped by passion for the apsaras who had come to achieve the target of the gods
the five apsaras got the status of wives to the sage who built them an invisible home inside the lake
the apsaras lived happily with the sage who remained youthful by virtue of his penance
while the apsaras played their musical instruments their melodious songs mingled with the sounds of ornaments are heard
glorious rama and his brother heard the wonderful words of the selfrealised sage and exclaimed how strange
when the sage dharmabrata was telling the story rama saw a hermitage strewn all over with kusa grass and bark garments and endowed with pure brahminic grace
illustrious rama accompanied by vaidehi and lakshmana entered the hermitage and honoured by all the sages stayed there
rama the scion of the kakutstha race wielder of great weapons stayed in that beautiful hermitage accepting the hospitality of the sages extended with due honour he visited in turn their penancegroves where he repeated his stay
rama lived happily here for about ten months there one year here four or five or six months and there over one or half a month or three or eight months in another
thus enjoying their stay in the hermitages rama sita and lakshmana spent ten favourable years
rama went round who was full of grace and full of knowledge on dharma went round with sita and came back to suthikshnas hermitage
on his arrival rama the subduer of enemies was honoured by the sages at the hermitage where he stayed for a short time
once while sitting beside sage sutikshna at the hermitage rama humbly addressed him
i have heard others saying that lord agastya the great sage lives in this forest
i am unable to locate the sacred hermitage of that sagacious sage due to the vastness of this forest
by your grace i wish to go there with sita and my brother lakshmana to offer our respectful salutations
there is a great desire in my heart to serve in person the best of sages agastya
hearing the words of rama the righteous son of dasaratha sage sutikshna was pleased to reply
i also wished you o raghava to visit agastya along with sita and lakshmana
luckily you have asked me on your own i will tell you where the great sage agastya lives
dear rama walk from here a distance of four yojanas there in the southerly direction stands the great beautiful hermitage of agastyas brother
this plain land in the beautiful forest tract is adorned with fig treesfilled with flowers fruits and delightful sounds of different birds
o rama there are lotusponds filled with clear sacred waters with different kinds of swans ducks and ruddy geese spend one night there and proceed early in the morning
if you go in the southern direction for a yojana you will find agasthyas hermitage by the side of a cluster of trees
vaidehi will feel happy in your company in that delightful forest region full of many treesso too will lakshmana
o glorious one if you have made up your mind to visit that great sage agastya think of starting today itself
rama heard the words of the sage offered him reverential salutations and set out along with his brother and sita
enjoying the sight of delightful forests cloudlike mountains lakes and rivers on the way and following the directions given by sutikshna rama was happy he said to lakshmana
surely this is the hermitage of great agastyas brother a man of holy deeds
this is the glade we were told about with thousands of trees drooping down with abundant fruits and flowers
feel this sudden astringent smell of ripe figs wafted by the breeze from the forest
heaps of firewood are seen here and there on the path there are blades of grass used for sacrificial ceremonies shining like vaidurya gems
in the middle of the forest can be seen like the tip of the dark clouds columns of smoke coming out of the top of hermitages
priests are coming out of the solitary sacred spots after their bath and making offerings of flowers they had themselves plucked
o handsome one surely this is the hermitage of agastyas brother about which i heard from sutikshna
assuming the form of a brahmin and using sanskrit language ilvala would invite brahmins for offering shraddha to the dead
ilvala would keep his brother sanctified so that he is fit for offering then he would feed the brahmins with mutton according to the rituals
then when the brahmins finished eating ilvala would call aloud o vatapi come out
then hearing his brothers voice vatapi would bleat like a sheep and jump out tearing open the bodies of those brahmins
in this manner thousands of brahmins used to be killed daily by those carnivorous demons who assumed any form at their free will
urged by the gods agastya came for the shradda the mighty demon played the same routine trick and vatapi for sure was eaten by the great sage
saying the ritual is complete ilvala offered water in the palm of agastya and called his brother to come out
wise agastya the best among the ascetics laughing aloud said to ilvala the destroyer of brahmins
i have digested the demon vatapi your brother who assumed the form of a sheep he has reached the abode of yama lord of death where does he have the power to come out
on hearing the news of the death of his brother the demon ilvala out of anger started attacking the sage
ilvala who pounced upon agastya the best among the sages whose lustre lay consumed by the fire of his eyes which were in flames
this hermitage surrounded by beautiful lakes and forests belongs to his brother sudarsana out of sympathy for agastya he has accomplished this difficult task
while rama was thus narrating to lakshmana the story of agastya the sun set and evening closed in
rama with his brother lakshmana duly offered oblations at twilight entered the hermitage and greeted the sage sudarsana with folded palms
warmly received by the sage rama shared the roots and fruits and slept the night there
when the night passed and the sun became bright rama took leave of the brother of agastya
o lord the night has been wellspent now we humbly seek leave of you to see your respectable elder brother
with his permission rama the delight of the raghu race proceeded along the path indicated watching the beauty of the forest
they passed by wild rice fields jackfruit trees palmyra and various other trees like ashoka trees with white flowers old trees that existed for a long time mahva trees bilva trees and tindukas
rama saw hundreds of trees crushed by the trunks of elephants and by monkeys he saw some trees echoing with notes of hundreds of intoxicated birds he saw tree tops coiled with creepers in full bloom
then the lotuseyed rama said to the chivalrous graceful lakshmana who stood behind him
the leaves of the trees here are glossy the animals and birds are peaceful it appears the hermitage of the selfrealized great sage agastya is not very far from here
here is the hermitage of agastya wellknown in the world for his deeds a place of rest for those tired with hard work
this forest is enveloped with the smoke rising from the sacrificial altar there are rows of bark robes hanging herds of quiet animals lying and different kind of birds chirping around
this is his hermitage on account of his agastyas impact the demons look south but cannot eat the hermits out of fear for the sage
since the time agastya of sacred deeds occupied this direction the demons are quiet leaving all enmity
the southern side favourable to the people was famous by the name agastya in the three worlds and stood unassailable to the demons
this is the hermitage of the longlived agastya who is renowned for his deeds and is served by humble people the great mountain vindhya that was growing incessantly and obstructing the path of the sun stopped growing any more in obedience to agastyas words
we are going to join this sage honoured by the people of the world and ever engaged in the welfare of the virtuous this augurs well for us
o noble handsome lakshmana i will spend the rest of the exile in this forest in the worship of the great sage agastya
the gods along with gandharvas siddhas and great sages always serve agastya observing discipine in their food habits
this sage is such type that he his spiritual power will not allow a liar or a cruel man or a deceitful or lustful or wicked person to thrive here
here gods yakshas nagas and birds live following the righteous path and observing discipline in food habits
here great souls like sages and siddhas gave up the ghost and with renewed bodies left for heaven on aerochariot resembling the sun in brightness
worshipped by benevolent beings the gods here bestow on them the status of demigods or of the immortals or several kinds of kingdoms
lakshmana the younger brother of rama entered the hermitage of agastya and met one of his disciples and said to him these words
the valiant eldest son of king dasaratha has come along with his wife sita to see the sage
i am his younger brother lakshmana his wellwisher and faithful devotee if you have at all heard about me
by the command of our father we have entered this dense forest and desire to see the divine sire please report
the ascetic heard lakshmana and saying let it be so entered the firesanctuary to report
having promptly entered agastyas favourite disciple with folded hands reported as he was told by lakshmana about ramas arrival to the great sage who was armed with the inviolable powers of penance
rama and lakshmana the two sons of dasaratha along with sita wife of rama have arrived at the hermitage
both the subduers of enemies have come here now to see and serve your holiness you may order what is to be done next
having heard from the disciple about the arrival of rama lakshmana and great daughter of the king of videha the sage said
it is good fortune that rama has come here after a long time to see me i was longing for his arrival
go quickly and with due hospitality conduct rama his wife sita and brother lakshmana into my presence why was he not ushered in so long
so be it said the disciple respectfully with folded palms in response to what the great sage knower of dharma commanded
then the disciple in a state of excitement came out of the hermitage and said to lakshmana where is rama let him come himself to see the sage
then lakshmana reached the entrance of the hermitage with the disciple and showed rama of the kakutstha race and sita daughter of janaka
the disciple humbly reported agastyas words and ushered him in with befitting hospitality
then rama sita and lakshmana entered the hermitage watching herds of quietly moving deer undisturbed by their entry
rama saw at the hermitage the places altars of brahma visnu agni firegod indra sun moon bhaga kubera dhata supreme spirit vidhata creator brahman vayu windgod ananta great serpentking gayatri vasu pasahasta varuna kartikeya and dharma
thereafter surrounded by the disciples the sage came out rama saw him coming in front of the effulgent sages
the valiant rama said to lakshmana the enhancer of prosperity o lakshmana sage agastya is coming out by virtue of his noble appearance i know this sage to be a great treasuretrove of penances
having said so the mightyarmed rama the scorcher of enemies grasped the feet of agastya who was shining like the sun
then righteous rama with sita the princess of videha and lakshmana offered respects with folded palmsstanding
agastya received rama by offering him seat and water enquired about his wellbeing and said please be seated
after giving oblations to the fire and providing respectful offerings the sage worshipped the guests according to the tradition of hermits and served them food
and then the great sage agastya knower of dharma first took his seat and addressed rama an export in the knowledge of dharma seated with folded palms
o scion of the kakutstha dynasty only after offering oblations to the firegod a guest should be worshipped with water etc otherwise the host will have to eat his own flesh in the other world like a false witness
you are king of all the worlds a follower of dharma a great warrior worthy of worship and an esteemed self o rama you are such a dear guest come to me
having said this to rama the sage honoured him by offering fruits roots flowers and other things as desired he then said to rama once again
o best among men this divine bow studded with gold and gems belongs to visnu and designed by visvakarma this excellent unfailing arrow bright like the sun was given to me by brahma
these two quivers filled fully with sharp inexhaustible arrows shining like flames of fire and this sword adorned with gold and this big silver sheath were given to me by indra
in ancient times visnu killed the demons in a battle with this bow and brought back the glittering prosperity for the gods
o bestower of honour receive this bow the two quivers the sword and the arrow for your victory just like indra accepts the thunderbolt
the luminous lord agastya having said this gave all the excellent weapons to rama and continued      thus ends the twelfth sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
o rama i am pleased i wish you well i am glad that both of you have come here with sita to pay respect to me
both of you are tired due to the journey it is evident that sita daughter of janaka is anxious to rest
even though delicate sita never feels discouraged by difficulties she has come to the forest full of obstacles since she is motivated by her love for her husband
o rama help sita enjoy herself in whatever manner she likes by following you into the forest she has accomplished the most difficult task
o rama the delight of the raghu dynasty from the beginning of the creation women by nature keep the husband company when all goes well and give them up when hard times come
women are fickle like lightning sharp like weapons and fast like garuda or the windgod
your wife is free from such blemishes she is praiseworthy and worthy of mention as an example just like the revered arundhati
o rama subduer of enemies the place where you reside along with lakshmana and vaidehi will look adorned indeed
thus addressed rama held his palms together and said politely to the sage shining like fire
i consider myself blessed and favoured by a great sage like you bestower of boons as you have been pleased with me my brother and my life
direct me to a place with water and dense forest where we can build an ashram and live happily
on hearing the words of rama agastya the best among the sages coolheaded and righteous thought a while and uttered these words coolly
o dear two yojanas away is a place wellknown as panchavati a beautiful resort with many roots fruits plenty of water and many animals
reaching there you wikk build a hermitage with lakshmana and enjoy your life given to the fulfilment of the pledge to the father
o rama scion of the kakutsthas much of the period of exile king dasaratha had assigned has passed you will fulfil your promise and live happily in the kingdom
o rama joy of the raghu family with the eldest son like you your father is blessed and liberated like king yayati
o sinless one i have kown all these facts about you by the power of penance and love for dasaratha
i know your heart by virtue of my penance i therefore ask you to proceed to panchavati after ensuring your stay here with me in this penancegrove for the time being
o raghava that forest tract is delightful and beautiful it is not far awayfrom here maithili sita will enjoy her stay there
o longarmed ramathat place has plenty of roots and fruits it is a solitary holy and beautiful place teeming with various kinds of birds sita will enjoy her stay in the vicinity of river godavari
o rama while staying with your wife you will look after the ascetics living there since you are capable of giving protection
o valiant rama look at the great forest of madhuka trees walk north to the forest till you see a great banyan tree
then climb the elevated ground not very far from the mountain there is the wellknown panchavati with forests ever in full bloom
thus addressed by agastya rama with lakshmana paid respects to the sage wedded to truth and took leave of him
both of them worshipped the feet of sage agastya and proceeded to panchavati with his permission
both the princes unafraid of battles held their bows tied the quivers and carefully proceeded towards panchavati along the path suggested by the sage     thus ends the thirteenth sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
on the way to panchavati rama the delight of the raghu race met a vulture with a huge body and fearful strength
seeing the bird on the banyan tree venerable rama and lakshmana mistook him for a demon and enquired who he was
with a sweet pleasing and gentle voice he said to both of them o dear know me to be a friend of your father
rama knew he was a friend of his father so he enquired in a cool composed voice his name and his lineage
on hearing ramas words the bird started narrating the origin of all beings including his own family
o mightyarmed rama hear from me while i am telling you about the lords of creation from the very beginning
o rama among the lords of all beings the first was kardama the next was vikritha followed by sesha samsrya bahuputra sthanu mareechi atri and mighty kratu pulastya angirasa pracheta similarly pulaha and dakshafollowing them were vivasvan arishtanemi and the very glorious kasyapa who was the last ruler
o glorious rama it is wellknown that daksha the creator had sixty daughters of great fame
out of themdaughters of daksha kasyapa married eight women of beautiful waist called aditi diti danu also kalikatamra krodhavasa anala and manu
kasyapa pleased with them said to his young wives beget sons of my stature who can rule over the three worlds
o best of men o longarmed rama while aditi diti and kalika seriously considered his advice the rest of the wives did not
o rama subduer and scorcher of enemies to aditi were born twelve adityas eight vasus eleven rudras and two asvins thirtythree deities in all
o dear rama diti bore glorious sons called daityas and this earth with all the forests and seas belonged to them
o subduer of enemies to danu was born hayagriva and to kalika naraka and kalaka
to tamra were born krounchi bhasi syeni dhrutharashtri and suki altogether they were five beautiful young maids famous in the world
krounchi gave birth to owls bhasi to bhasa birds synei to bright hawks and vultures dhrutharashtri to swans and chakravakas with sweet notes
dhrutharashtri a female bird of great lustre gave birth to chakravakas too suki gave birth to nata and from nata vinata was born be blessed o rama
o ramato krodhavasa were born mrugi mrugamanda hari bhadramada mathangi sardooli sweta surabhi and surasa kadruva and endowed with all virtues
o best of men all kinds of animals were born of mrugito mrugamanda were born bears and chamara a different kind of deer
to hari were born lions and swiftmoving monkeys and to bhadramada a daughter by name iravati
o bull among men matangi gave birth to elephantsthe mighty elephant airavata who became the lord of the world was born to iravati
o rama sarduli gave birth to tigers and playful roundbodied monkeys called golangula and sweta delivered elephants as sons for guarding the eight quarters
surabhi gave birth to rohini and gandharvithe two famous daughters may you be happy rama
o rama rohini procreated cows and gandharvi horses as offsprings surasa delivered cobras and kadru ordinary serpents
o rama bull among men manu procreated brahmins kshatriyas vaisyas and sudras all famed human beings
anala wife of kasyapa procreated trees with sacred fruits vinata was the granddaughter of suki and kahdruva and surasa were her sisters
kadhru produced a thousandhooded serpentadisesha who held the whole earth on his head and vinata two sons garuda and aruna
i am born to aruna and my elder brother is sampati o subduer of enemies know me as jatayu son of syeni
if you so desire i will be helpful to you in guarding your hut o dear it is a difficult forest full of wild animals and demons when you and lakshmana are away i will protect sita
rama worshipped jatayu and bending down embraced him he heard from him again and again several events relating to jatayus friendship with his father
entresting the protection of sita the princess of mithila to that strong vulture jatayu and accompanied by lakshmana rama went to panchavati wishing to destroy the enemies like fire burning the moths     thus ends the fourteenth sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
on reaching panchavati which was full of various vicious animals rama said to lakshmana his brother who was glowing like fire
o handsome one following the directions of the great sage we have arrived at panchavati a place full of blossoming trees
o lakshmana cast your eyes all around the forest for a suitable place for building a hermitage indeed you are good at judging things
look o lakshmana for a place to the liking of sita a place where there is water source nearby where both of us can enjoy find a beautiful location where the surrounding forest is beautiful and where faggots flowers water and kusa grass are available at hand
having been thus instructed by rama lakshmana said with folded palms in the presence of sita
o rama i shall be dependent on you even if i live for a hundred years you only need to indicate a beautiful place of your choice
rama was pleased with the words of great lakshmana deliberating over it he agreed upon a site suitable in all respects
having come to a beautiful spot suitable for the asram rama took both the hands of lakshmana in his own and said
this place is level surrounded by beautiful trees in full bloom o handsome one you may build the hermitage here
there not very far is a beautiful lotustank shining like the sun fragrant with lotuses
as said by the selfrealised soul sage agastya this godavari is beautiful surrounded by trees with flowers in bloom filled with flocks of swans ducks and ruddy geese
o handsome one neither far nor near are seen tall mountains and flowering trees and herds of deer their numerous caves echo with sounds of peacocks
these mountains with streaks of minerals like gold silver and copper forming decorative designs look beautiful like colourful windows and appear like huge elephants
the place is covered with sal and palmyrah trees including mango jackfruit dates kadamba punnaga ashoka champak tilaka ketaka sandalwood spandan dhava asvakarna parnasha khadira sami kimsuka and patala trees it is full of wild paddy flowering bushes and creepers that run on the ground
this is a holy place fit for sacrifice there are many animals and birds herehence we will reside here with jatayu
thus directed by rama the mighty lakshmana destroyer of enemy warriors soon built a hermitage for his brother
lakshmana who was quick to act dug the clay with nippers planted long bamboo poles put branches of sami trees across and tied them with strong ropes he spread kusa and kasa grass and leaves on the levelled ground he built a beautiful spacious and nice residence for rama
lakshmana then went to river godavari had his bath and returned with some lotuses
lakshmana offered oblation of flowers invoked peace as per tradition before occupying a newly made home and showed rama the cottage he had built
rama and sita saw the beautiful hermitage built by lakshmana and expressed much happiness over the leafthatched cottage
deeply pleased with lakshmana he hugged him tightly and said those loving words
o my master you have done a great task for which i have given you what i could give at the moment a hug
o lakshmana with a son like you who can understand others feelings who has a sense of gratitude and a sense of duty my father is not dead yet
rama who was an enhancer of fortunes and who had his senses under control said thus to lakshmana and lived happily there in that place filled with fruits
righteous rama served by lakshmana and sita lived there for some time like a god in heaven      thus ends the fifteenth sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
while the great self rama lived happily there autumn passed and dear winter set in
once rama delight of the raghu race went to the beautiful river godavari for ablution in the early hours of the morning
while valiant lakshmana walking behind sita who was carrying a pitcher in her hand bent down a little and told rama thus
o sweetspeaking brother the season which is dear to you has arrived it appears the auspicious year is going to be embellished with this season
people feel frozen with fog and water is no more enjoyable the earth is full of crops and fire is so agreeable
pious men offer their libations of the first crop at agnistoma sacrifice and thereby please their manes and get rid of their sins
people in the countryside with their desires satisfied obtain abundant cows milk at this time rulers of the earth are out on their expedition with a desire for victory
as the sun has resorted to the direction south that serves the god of death the north devoid of the sun shines like a woman without the vermilion mark on the forehead
presently with the sun far away the himalayas abounding in snow has naturally justified its name
the days are enjoyable at noon as it is pleasant to move about during this time since the sun is not scorching but the shade and water seem to be unfortunate as they are not liked by any one
the days will be frostsmitten the sun will also be mild due to heavy dewfall the weather will be cold with the blowing of the wind forests will be empty as no animals would be seen moving around
at this time people do not sleep under the open sky with the month of pushya approaching nights feel cool and look red due to frost they prolong into three yamas
with the radiance of the sun dimmed with its orb reddened by frost the moon does not shine clear like a mirror blurred with breath
on a fullmoon night the beams of the moon faded by forest look pale dull like sita scorched by the heat of the sun
the west wind which by nature feels cold at this time blows doubly cold hit by snow
the snowcold forest terrains are fertile with barley and wheat crops as the sun rises the swans and kraunchas produce pleasing notes
the tops of rice crops shining like gold resemble the flowers of datepalmthe fields full of ripe paddy bending a little under the weight of grains look delightful
the sun risen at the distant horizon looks like the moon his lengthening rays covered with snow and dew
the heat of the sun which we do not feel in the forenoon is comfortable during midday when the sun shines slightly reddish white on earth
as the miadows are wet with dewdrops the land looks delightful with mild sunlight shining on the surface
the wild tusker extremely thirsty touches the clean cold water joyfully but immediately withdraws its trunk unable to bear the cold
just as inefficient warriors do not enter the warfield aquatic birds sitting near water do not venture to take a plunge into it
the flowerless forest ranges appear as if they are asleep enveloped in the darkness of frost and snow
now the rivers are not visible as the waters are covered with vapour they are only inferred through the cackling of swans and the sands of the bank moistened with dewdrops
due to snowfall mildness of the sun and coldness of weather even the water flowing from the mountain top is not generally tasty
the lotuses in the tank no more shine bright as they are decayed by age their filaments and pericarps withered with only stalks remaining
at this time righteous bharata the best among men with his devotion to you must be sadly performing penance at his residence
giving up his kingdom honour and pleasures of many kinds bharata will be living like an ascetic sleeping on the ground in cold weather his food under restriction
at this time bharata accompanied by his subjects must be daily going to river sarayu for ablution
how can bharata who was brought up in luxury who is delicate and deserves all comfort take a dip in river sarayu in cold morning
he has a blue complexion a pair of eyes like lotus petals a thin waist and long arms he is selfrestrained softspoken sweettempered and truthful he knows his duty and maintains a low profile a subduer of enemies he is heroic and great such bharata has given up the diverse pleasures of life and has surrendered himself to you with all his soul
although you dwell in the forest your great brother bharata has won the kingdom of heaven by faithfully adopting your asceticism
the saying that men follow mothers path but not the path of the father has been disproved by bharata
how could mother kaikeyi who has a husband like dasaratha and a noble son like bharata be so wicked by nature
when pious lakshmana said thus to rama out of his love for him rama replied unable to tolerate the words of censure against mother kaikeyi
o dear kaikeyi our second mother is never to be criticised like that you may however speak more of bharata the lord of the iksvakus
even though i have made up my mind to dwell in the forest and keep my vow my love for bharata makes me waver like a child rama does not want bharata to suffer on his account
i remember his dear sweet ambrosial words soothing to the heart and pleasing to the mind
o enhancer of joy of the raghus when shall i meet great bharata brave satrughna and you all together
expressing his grief in such manner rama reached godavari where he took his bath with his brother and sita
and then poised they offered libations of water to their forefathers and gods and prayer to the rising sun
accompanied by sita and lakshmanarama finished his bath in the riverhe looked splendid like lord rudra followed by nandi and the daughter of the king of the mountains parvati      thus ends the sixteenth sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
ablution over rama accompanied by sita and lakshmana went back from the bank of the river godabari to their hermitage
on reaching the hermitage rama and lakshmana performed the forenoon rituals and entered the leafthatched cottage
honoured by the ascetics rama stayed there peacefully with brother lakshmana discussing diverse matters from time to time
longarmed rama seated with sita in the cottage appeared like the moon in conjunction with constellation chitra
while rama was thus seated engrossed in conversation there incidentally appeared a demoness
surpanakha sister of the tenheaded demon ravana approached rama shining like a god
the demoness was infatuated with rama whose chest was like that of a lion who was strongarmed who had a glowing face pleasing to the eyes who walked with the gait of an elephant whose hair was matted who was gentle and strong who was endowed with royal traits who had a blue lotuslike complexion who was handsome as the god of love and who resembled indra
ramas face was lovely surpanakhas was hideous rama had a slender waist she had a huge belly his eyes were large hers were deformed his hair was black and beautiful hers was coppercoloured he was lovely in appearance she was ugly his voice was sweet hers was shrill he was young she was dreadfully old he was positive she was perverted rama was wellbehaved she was wicked rama was just and loving while she was overcome by lust this demoness said to rama
o rama you are wearing matted hair like an ascetic but living with your wife and holding bow and arrows what brings you to this place haunted by demons you should tell me the truth
thus asked by the demoness surpanakha rama scorcher of foes began telling her everything due to his simplemindedness
to rama untruth is never acceptable at the hermitage and especially in the presence of a woman
rama replied there was a king named dasaratha who was mighty like the gods i am his eldest son known among the people as rama
here is lakshmana my younger brother who always follows me and this is the daughter of the king of videha and my wife wellknown as sita
i have come here commanded by the king my father and motherintending to obey the orders of my father and impelled by duty to establish righteousness i have come to reside here
i wish to know who you are tell me who your kins are with lovely limbs you do not appear to be a demoness
tell me truly what you have come here for having heard the words of rama and overtaken by passion the demoness said
my name is surpanakha i am a demoness who can assume any form at will i move in this forest alone unleashing a reign of terror
my brother is ravana son of visrava and lord of all demons you have heard his name i suppose
kumbhakarna is another brother of mine he is very strong he is always in deep sleep vibhisna another brother he is righteous free from any demoniac trait my other two brothers are khara and dusana who are wellknown heroes of war
setting them aside i came here as soon as i saw you you are the finest among men and i am here wishing you to be my husband
i have influence over others i have capacity to move wherever i want be my husband forever what will you do with sita
she is ugly deformed unsuitable for you i am alone fit for you look upon me as your wife
i will devour your brother along with this disfigured unchaste and fearful lady with a flat belly
o darling thereafter you can keep wandering with me in this dandaka forest enjoying the beauty of the mountain tops and forests
thus addressed rama skilled in speech laughed and started speaking to that woman of bewitching eyes     thus ends the seventeenth sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
to surpanakha bound by the noose of passion rama with a smile replied in a clear lucid manner
o lady i am married and here is my wife who is dear to me to be a cowife to some one is indeed painful for people like you
here is my younger brother lakshmana he is a man of good conduct good look valiant and virtuous besides he is not with his wife
he is not with his wife and is in need of one he is young handsome and worthy he will be an appropriate husband to you
o woman of large eyes and fine hips my brother is fit for you you will with him shine like the radiant sun on mount meru you will enjoy yourself without a cowife you may approach him
thus told by rama the demoness deluded with lust left him suddenly and said to lakshmana
with my fine complexion i will be a suitable wife for you you can happily wander about in dandaka forest with me
thus addressed by the demoness lakshmana son of sumitra wellversed in the use of words gave her a befitting reply
o lotuscomplexioned woman how can you act as a maid to a slave why do you intend to be so i am already dependent on my revered brother
o largeeyed one you have a clear complexion you may become the younger wife of my master who is lord of great wealth and live a happy fulfilled life
he will abandon this uglylooking unchaste frightening old woman of drooping belly and accept you alone as his wife
o lady of fair complexion and beautiful hips which wise man will fall in love with any other female giving up a fine figure like you
while lakshmana was thus making fun of the dreadful droopingbellied surpanakha she presumed his words to be true
deluded with passion surpanakha said to formidable rama the scorcher of foes seated in the leafthatched hut along with sita
i shall eat up this woman now before your very eyes and i can move about happily with you without a cowife
while speaking this surpanakha with eyes like flaming amber ran to the fawneyed sita in great anger like a giant meteor hurtling towards the constellation of rohini
mighty rama in a rage restrained her who was falling upon sita like the noose of death and said to lakshmana
o handsome lakshmana it is not proper to cut jokes with wicked uncivilized persons now see sita who has somehow survived
o tiger among men this uncouth bigbellied unchaste and highly passionate demoness deserves to be formed
thus instructed by rama powerful lakshmana took position by the side of rama angrily lifted the sword and cut off her nose and ears
dreadful surpanakha with her ears and nose cut off roared in a hoarse voice and ran away into the forest in the same direction as she came
the dreadful demoness who thus was disfigured drenched in blood she thundered like a cloud in rainy season
dripping blood profusely the frightful demoness lifted her arms and entered the great forestroaring
a disfigured demoness she fell down like the thunderbolt from the sky on the ground while her fiercelooking brother khara sat surrounded by demons at janasthana
thereafter the sister of khara wild with fear and delusion and drenched in blood narrated all about the arrival of rama sita and lakshmana in the forest and her disfigurement     thus ends the eighteenth sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
burning with anger to see his sister fallen down disfigured and drenched in blood khara enquired
get up give up your confusion and stupefaction tell me clearly by whom you have been disfigured like this
who will hurt an innocent venomous black serpent and stay away quietly close by for fun with his finger tip
who is he who has tied has tied his throat with the noose of death out of ignorance and yet does not know the implications who is he who has caused this injury to you but does not understand that he has drunk deadly poison
you have sufficient strength and courage you are capable of moving as you like and taking any form at your will by whom have you been brought to this state and drawn close to death
which valiant person among gods gandharvas sages and other great people has disfigured you like this
i can see none in this world who can offend me nor even the thousandeyed indra among the gods
just as the swan drinks only milk from water mixed with milk my arrows will unerringly drain the life from the enemys body right now
whose foamy red blood will the earth drink while i strike his vital organs with my arrows in the fight
whose flesh will be eaten by cheerful flocks of vultures biting and tearing his body when he is killed by me in the battle
neither gods nor devils nor gandharvas nor even demons will have the power to rescue that hapless creature dragged by me ruthlessly in the battle
you should tell me as you slowly regain your consciousness which bragart has overpowered you in the forest with his strength
on hearing her angry brother surpanakha replied with words choked with tears
here are two young sons of dasaratha rama and lakshmana who are gentle handsome strong with eyes like white lotus wearing deerskin and bark robes living on fruits and roots selfrestrained like ascetics and following the righteous path
they are kings of the gandharvas with all royal insignia i was not able to discern whether they are gods or humans
i saw between them a young beautiful woman of slender waist adorned with all kinds of jewels
i have been subjected to this state of an orphan unfaithful woman by both of them for the sake of that lady
i wish to drink the foamy blood of that crooked woman and of both the brothers slain on the battle front
o dear this is my first wish and you must fulfil it i will drink her blood and of the two brothers in the battle
as she was speaking the inflamed khara ordered fourteen very strong demons comparable to yama the god of death to proceed
two human beings equipped with weapons clad in bark robes and deerskin have entered the dreadful dandaka forest along with a woman of bewitching beauty
i want you to get both of them along with that notorious woman killed this sister of mine will drink their blood
o demons quickly go and crush them with your power and fulfil my sisters sincere wish
thus commanded the fourteen demons along with surpanakha rushed there like windblown clouds
the nightrangers were unable to crush himrama despite their sharp glowing weapons just as wild elephants cannot face all at once the rising flame of the forest fire     thus ends the nineteenth sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
the frightful surpanakha came to the hermitage of rama and showed both the brothers and sita to the demons
they saw mighty rama together with vaidehi and lakshmana sitting in the leafthatched cottage
seeing the demons along with surpanakha arrive said the handsome rama scion of the raghu dynasty to his brother lakshmana who was blazing like fire
o lakshmana stand by sita for a while i shall kill these demons who have come here
lakshmana heard him and in turn honoured the word of rama knower of the self
righteous rama too lifted up his great bow decked with gold and fastened the string and then said to the demons
we rama and lakshmana sons of dasaratha are brothers who have entered the inaccessible dandaka forest along with sita
feeding on fruits and roots and following the righteous path we are living in dandaka forest like ascetics why are you torturing us
i came here equipped with bows arrows and weapons asked by ascetics to kill in the battle sinners like you who are offending them
if you care for your life you may return or else if you please you may remain die here o demons
at these words the destroyers of brahmins the fourteen demons were inflamed they lifted their spears and spoke
you have incited the wrath of khara our great master for which you will now pay with your life in the fight
how can you face us alone we outnumber you leave alone fighting you cannot even stand in front of us
come on with daggers and sharpedged spears hurled you will give up your lifeyour prowess as well as the bow held in your hand
saying these words the fourteen infuriated demons hurled their spears at invincible rama
all the fourteen spears hurled turned into splinters by the same number of golden arrows released by rama
then the effulgent rama mighty angry took fourteen arrows sharpened by stones and glowing like the sun
rama took the bow stretched it and aimed at his target the demons and sent the arrows as indra would release the thunderbolt
goldfeathered blazing arrows decorated with gold released by rama flew fast and pierced the chests of the demons drenched in blood they the arrows thundered out of their chests and plunged into the earth
with their hearts split their bodies drenched in blood disfigured and lifeless the demons fell down on earth like trees cut at the roots
seeing the demons fallen on the ground the demoness wild with anger and fear roared
her blood slightly dried up she came back afflicted to khara and fell down like a sallaki tree its sap oozing
missing
then desperately screaming and shedding tears with a sad face beside her brother she roared again and again
when surpanakha saw the demons fall dead on the battleground she ran to kharaher brother and told in detail about the death of the demons     thus ends the twentieth sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
seeing surpanakha collapse khara said in clear terms about the unfortunate situation she had created
the valiant demons who feed on blood have been commissioned for your pleasure why are you crying again
they are loyal and faithful to me they are always my wellwishers even when attacked they cannot be killed they never fail to carry out my orders
i wish to know what makes you lament and roll on the ground like a serpent and hissing
when i am here like a lord to protect you why do you weep like an orphan get up give up your anxiety be not afraid
thus consoled by khara invincible surpanakha wiped her tearful eyes and said to her brother
my ears and nose sliced off drenched with blood i came to you and you pacified me
o warrior you had sent out of anger fourteen demons to put an end to rama along with lakshmana in order to please me
the demons who went with spears in their hands were killed their hearts pierced by ramas arrows
seeing the powerful demons collapse on the ground in a moments time through ramas action i was frightened
o demon i am scared and sad to me everything looks frightening i therefore seek refuge in you
i am drowned in a vast sea of sorrow where crocodiles in the form of distress reside it is full of rows of waves of fright why do you not save me
the demons who live on flesh who came following me fell down on earth and lay dead shot by the sharp arrows of rama
o demon if you have compassion for me or for the demons if you have the power and energy to face rama kill the enemy of the demons living in dandaka forest
if now you do not kill that rama my enemy o shameless one i will give up my life in your very presence
instinctively i can foresee that you and your army do not have the capability to encounter that great rama in a fight
you call yourself a hero yet are not able to kill two humans like rama and lakshmana your claim to heroism is false you are not a hero at all
o demon you are a disgrace to the family if you have power or energy kill that rama dwelling in dandaka forest
you have little strength and less heroism you with your relations should immediately leave janasthana what kind of position do you have here
let down by the brilliance of rama son of dasaratha you will be soon destroyed he is mighty and his brother who has disfigured me is very valiant
overcome by sorrow the bigbellied demoness cried in several ways and being very sad started beating her chest with both hands     thus ends the twentyfirst sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
ashamed and accused thus in the presence of the demons the valiant khara spoke to surpanakha in harsh words
like the overslowing salt sea water i am unable to contain this my excessive anger arising out of your insult
rama is a shortlived human i do not care for his valour his life span will be shortened he will be killed now for his own misdeeds
restrain your tears and your anxieties i will send rama along with his brother to the abode of yama
with his life ebbing out killed by my axe in the fight you will drink today o demoness ramas red hot blood
on hearing the words that came out of kharas mouth she was pleased and in stupidity began praising her brother once again as the best of demons
khara accused by her earlier and admired again said to dusana chief of army
there are fourteen thousand demons at my command ready to act according to my will they are warriors of terrific speed and will not retreat from the fight
they are of the colour of the dark blue cloud dreadful and merciless strong and powerful fighters who roam about forturing people
o handsome one get them all powerful like tigers demons with large countenances mighty and arragant ready for the fight
o goodnatured one get my chariot bows and arrows wonderful swords of different kinds and sharp missiles ready quickly
o expert in warfare i wish to lead those great warriors of paulasthya family to kill that immodest rama
while khara was speaking thus dusana reported that a huge chariot of the colour of the sun yoked with good horses of variegated hues stood ready
then the impatient khara mounted the chariot that looked like the peak of mount meru it was decorated with pure gold had golden wheels poles studded with vaidurya the carriage of the chariot was engraved with golden figures of fishes flowers trees the sun stars flocks of auspicious birds flags and swords shining with small bells it was yoked to fine horses
the demons of terrific prowess surounded khara and dusana and stood by when they saw both of them mounting the chariot
khara mounted the chariot saw the demons holding great weapons wearing dreadful shields and holding flags and ordered them to march
then the army of the demons wearing dreadful shields holding weapons and flags and making a loud noise started in great speed from janasthanam
the fourteen thousand demons loyal to the wishes of khara took in their hands maces piercing weapons spears sharp axes used in battle swords wheels splinters iron clubs powerful missiles dreadful iron bars of giant size bows made of bamboo clubs and frightening weapons like thunderbolt of indra and departed from janasthana
kharas chariot moved a bit behind the army of demons of frightening prowess who rushed forward to attack rama
knowing the mind of khara the charioteer hastened the horses of the colourful chariot decorated with pure gold
spurred by the charioteer the chariot of khara the slayer of enemies produced a rattle that filled all four quarters and the intermediate directions
khara in extreme anger hastened like yama to slay his enemy he roared loudly like a cloud raining hail stones and impelled his charioteer to speed up      thus ends the twentysecond sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
as the army marched from there janasthana a huge dark cloud of the colour of an ass rained dreadful inauspicious water red as blood
the swift horses yoked to the chariot stumbled casually while galloping on the plane highway sprinkled with flowers
a dark ring bloodred in colour appeared on the border of the suns orb dark in the middle this phenomenon of the sun appeared like a ring of moving charcoal covering the sun
a huge vulture frightening to look at flew up and sat on top of the flag on the staff of gold
flesheating beasts and birds flocked at janasthana producing a cacophony
the dreadful jackals making ghastly howls turning towards the illuminated direction and produced frightening sounds indicating inauspicious time for the demons
the clouds looked like shattered mountains pouring down bloodlike rain which filled the sky and made it appear frighteningly different
a terrific darkness spread all over produced frightening horripilation even the four quarters and the intermediary zones were not discernible
even before sunset the twilight looked like a fresh wound then wild animals birds kankas jackals and vultures facing towards khara screeched indicating danger
bad omens that always bring inauspiciousness were a dreadful evidence of what is going to happen jackals howled facing kharas army with their mouths emitting fire
the planet ketu appeared like an iron beam near the sun although it was not the fullmoon or newmoon day rahu eclipsed the sun wind blew hard and the sun was lustreless
the stars rose in the sky and glittered like fireflies even before night arrived the fishes and the aquatic birds in the lotusponds hid themselves under water lotuses dried up in tanks and the trees stood bereft of flowers and fruits
although there was no wind dust rose like a brown cloud and the sarika birds sang vichi kuchi thoughtlessly
dreadful to watch were the thunderstorms and the meteors that dropped down from the sky the earth trembled all over with mountains groves and forests
while the intelligent and courageous khara was seated on the chariot and shouting his left shoulder shook violently and throat throttled
while watching all this his eyes brimmed with tears his forehead ached yet he was too deluded to beat a retreat
looking at these dreadful horripilating occurrences khara laughed and said to the demons
valiant and strong i do not take seriously these terrifying omens boding calamity just as a strong man does not care for the weak
with my sharp arrows i can even bring down the stars from the sky if angered i can cause mortality to the god of death
i do not wish to return without killing with my sharp arrows that rama who is proud of his strength and his brother lakshmana
let my sister be satisfied by drinking the blood of both rama and lakshmana on whose account this adversity has come
i have never faced defeat in wars and all of you have seen it with your eyes i am not telling you a lie
when angry i can kill even indra the wielder of the thunderbolt rider of the intoxicated airavata and lord of the gods what to speak of these two petty humans
fallen into the deathtrap the great army of the demon felt very happy on hearing khara roaring
great souls like sages gods gandharvas and siddhas including celestial bards assembled to see the battle
holy men assembled and uttered benedictions saying let there be wellbeing for the cows and brahmins associated with men of pious deeds in all the three worlds
let rama conquer the descendants of paulasthya in the war like visnu the wielder of the wheel had defeated great demons
the great ascetics were talking thus and more the gods waiting eagerly on heavenly chariots saw the army of the demons whose life span was shortened who were doomed to death
seeing khara their chief on the chariot driving fast the army of demons too marched forward
surrounded by twelve valiant warriors like syenagami pruthugreeva yagnasatru vihangama durjaya karaviraksha parusha kalakarmuka meghmali mahamali sarpasya and rudhirasana khara proceeded
similarly dusana proceeded with four mahakapali sthulaksha pramathi and trisira around him
the mighty swiftfooted army of valiant demons surrounded the princes rama and lakshmana all on a sudden like the planets around the sun and the moon     thus ends the twentythird sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
when khara endowed with malicious might was marching towards the hermitage rama and his brother saw the same omens of impending calamity the demon had seen
when rama saw the most dreadful horripilating phenomena foreboding calamity he said to lakshmana
o longarmed lakshmana see these calamitous phenomena that forebode mass destruction of men and demons
these rumbling clouds brownishred like the colour of a donkey are moving about in the sky showering streams of blood
o lakshmana all my arrows are smoking and this goldplated bow welcomes me to war
the way the forestbirds are screeching makes me foresee danger and makes survival doubtful
a mass destruction of life is going to take place there is no doubt about it o brave lakshmana my right shoulder trembles again and again indicating the defeat of the enemy your beaming visage presages victory
o lakshmana while preparing for war those whose faces look pale are for sure going to die
a dreadful roar of demons and the loud sound of wardrums beaten by the wicked demons are heard
a wise man who apprehends danger or one who desires his own good should plan his defence even before the onset of danger
therefore take shelter along with sita in the inaccessible mountain cave overgrown with trees ready with your bow and arrows
o dear i do not like you to oppose this word of honour you must touch my feet and go without delay
you are valiant and strong there is no doubt that you can kill all these demons but i desire to kill them
thus ordered by rama lakshmana took the arrows and the bow and accompanied by sita took shelter in the inaccessible cave
with lakshmana and sita inside the cave rama heaved his shield saying oh the work is accomplished
adorned with the shield rama shone like smokeless fire rising in darkness
valiant rama lifted the huge bow and arrows and stood there filling the directions with the twangs of his bow
then the gods along with gandharvas siddhas and celestial bards assembled there wishing to witness the war
great ascetics of the world distinguished brahmarsis accomplishers of pious deeds assembled and said to one another
let there be wellbeing for the cows brahmins and all the worlds let rama the scion of the raghu race conquer the paulastyas demons in war like lord visnu wielder of the disc who defeated the most powerful demons
thus looking at one another they discussed among themselves how there can be war between the righteous rama fighting singlehanded on the one hand and the fourteen thousand demons performers of terrific deeds on the other
rajarsis siddhas great brahmins with their clan and gods on the celestial chariots waited to see the war whetted with curiosity
seeing rama standing on the war front engrossed and radiating heroic lustre all beings were alarmed
rama who is unwearied in action and who is of an incomparable lovely form looked ferocious like the wielder of pinaka lord siva
then appeared on all sides the wellequipped army of demons raising deep sounds with dreadful shields weapons and banners
the forest was filled with tumultuous sounds of the warriors roaring like lions shouting at one another stretching the bowstrings constantly yawning proclaiming loudly and beating the drums
the ferocious animals of the forest got frightened and ran away to silent spots without looking back
the fierce army deep like the sea equipped with various missiles approached rama
rama wellversed in warfare cast his eyes on all sides to see the army of khara that had come prepared for war
rama stretched the formidable bow and lifted the arrows from his quiver to kill the demons and assumed intense anger
rama stood burning in anger like the fire of the dooms day it was difficult even to look at him seeing him full of glow even the sylvan deities ran away
rama in anger looked like lord siva ready to destroy the sacrifice of daksha
seeing rama flashing in anger and standing on the warfront all creatures ran away frightened
the army of demons equipped with blazing armour bows and banners appeared like a mass of blue clouds at sunrise      thus ends the twentyfourth sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
khara accompanied by his pilot party arrived at the hermitage of rama the destroyer of enemies and saw him in fury standing ready with his bow
on seeing rama khara held his terribly twanging bow and arrow stood facing him and ordered the charioteer to drive towards him
commanded by khara the charioteer also urged the horses towards the mightyarmed rama standing alone and wielding the bow
seeing khara attacking rama all the demon ministers surrounded him roaring
seated on a chariot in the midst of the demons khara looked like the rising mars in the middle of the stars
khara struck rama of immeasurable prowess with a thousand arrows and roared loudly
thereafter all the infuriated demons showered on invincible rama wielder of a fierce bow many kinds of weapons
overtaken by anger the demons continuously hurled at rama hammers spears spikes barbed missiles swords and battleaxes
very powerful demons like huge clouds roared eager to kill rama in war they ran forward on chariots horses and tall elephants looking like mountain tops
the battalions of demons sent down streams of arrows on rama just like clouds downpour on mountains
surrounded by the terrible demons rama appeared like lord siva at dusk with hosts of his retinues arounds
rama resisted the weapons released by the demons like the sea the inflow of river waters
rama remained unhurt like a great mountain struck by many glowing thunderbolts he felt no pain even though his limbs were hit by the dreadful weapons
wounded all over the body bleeding through the wounds caused by weapons rama looked like the evening sun covered with clouds
seeing rama left alone surrounded by many thousands of demons the gods ghandarvas and siddhas became very sad
thereafter rama mighty angry bent his bow and released hundreds and thousands of unfeathered arrows
as if sporting rama discharged the arrows attached with herons feathers the arrows were inescapable unbearable like that of yamas staff that went straight without missing the target
the arrows like the noose of the god of death released by rama on the enemy army easily destroyed the lives of the demons
ramas arrows pierced the bodies of the demons and drenched in blood they looking like burning fire shone in the sky
from ramas bow bent into a cirle countless fierce arrows able to take the lives of demons were released
in war rama cut asunder the bows flag tops armour and heads of demons their shoulders and thighs that were like the trunks of elephants in their hundreds and thousands
he killed horses with golden armours yoked to the chariots along with charioteers elephants along with riders the cavalry along with their horses and infantry and sent them all to the abode of death
the bodies of the demons torn into pieces by the very sharp iron arrows and by the arrows called vikarni they cried and shouted aloud in pitiable voices
just like the dried up forest burnt by the fire the army was totally destroyed by ramas arrows that pierced into the vital parts of the soldiers
a few warriors of fierce strength approached rama and hurled at him very powerful weapons spears swords and axes
strongarmed rama attacked them with his arrows and cut off their heads and took their lives
the heads armour and bows fell down broken on the ground like trees in the wind gererated by garudas wings
the rest of the demons hit by the arrows ran desperate towards khara for refuge
pacifying them all dusana regathered them again and ran towards rama like an angry yama rushing towards rudra
under dusanas protection all of them felt relieved from fear and carrying sal and palm trees and stones as weapons advanced towards rama again
holding spears hammers and bows in their hands the mighty demons rained on rama weapons like arrows trees and stones
the thrilling fierce horrifying and horripilating battle again ensued betwen rama and the demons
as the infuriated demons again hurtled towards rama filling the quarters and the intermediate directions and raining missiles rama aimed at them dazzling gandharvastras producing a frightening warcry
rama then let out from his bow stretched round thousands of arrows that covered all the ten quarters
the demons though wounded could not see whereform the terrible arrows came they only saw rama shooting the arrows
through the darkness created by the arrows that covered the sky and the sun rama looked as though he was vomitting them
it seemed as if it all happened at the same time the entire earth filling with demons seriously injured slain and fallen down on the ground
there were bodies of demons pierced and torn thinned and fallen down destroyed broken and cut into pieces scattered in their thousands
slain thus by ramas arrows the ground was littered with bodies of demons with limbs dismembered headdresses and shoulders cut off arms thighs and knees decked with various ornaments amputated chariots horses best of elephants fans made of the tail of chamari deer used as an insignia of royalty umbrellas several flags and weapons like spears swords darts battleaxes and stones crushed into pieces and arrows splintered and scattered all over the ground looked frightening     thus ends the twentyfifth sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
mightyarmed dusana saw the army getting killed in war he led the forces of five thousand demons dreadfuly quick at fighting dangeous to face and who will not beat a retreat
the demons continuously hurled at him rama spears and swords and rained stones trees and arrows from all sides
righteous rama retaliated with his sharp arrows such as the rain of trees and stones the mighty destroyers of life
rama retaliated in great anger to kill without caring for the shower of weapons like a bull with its eyes closed
overpowered by anger rama with a blazing glow covered dusana and his army with his arrows
thereafter dusana chief of the army angrily released at rama equally powerful arrows comparable to thunderbolt
heroic rama mighty angry then broke the big bow of dusana with his swordlike arrow and with a series of four arrows cut his four horses to pieces
after killing the horses with sharp arrows rama severed the charioteers head with an arrow of the shape of the crescent moon and pierced dusanas chest with a set of three arrows
with his bow and chariot broken charioteer and horses killed dusana took up a spear in his hand that appeared like a huge mountain top bound by golden bands covered the iron nails wetted with the enemys marrow it created a horripilation it appeared as though it could crush the army of gods and render the enemy powerless it carried the killing touch of the thunderbolt and could break open the enemys fort
with the spear that looked like a mighty serpent dusana the cruel demon advanced towards rama
seeing dusana going to pounce upon him rama cut off with two arrows both his arms adorned with armlets
with the hands amputated his huge spear like the banner of indra slipped off his hands and fell down on the ground on the battle front
dusana fell down on the ground with broken hands like a proud elephant with both his tusks shattered
seeing dusaana collapse dead on the ground all beings hailed rama saying well done well done
meanwhile all the three army chiefs mahakapala sthulaksha and the mighty pramathi ran towards rama in anger bound as though by the noose of death
mahakapala had a huge spear sthulaksha a sharpedged spear and pramathi a battleaxe
on seeing them rushing to attack him with sharp weapons rama received them quickly with pointed arrows as though they were guests
mahakapalas head was cut to pieces with sharp arrows and pramathi was killed with a countless series of arrows pramathis body like a huge tree with many branches collapsed on the ground
rama filled the eyes of sthulaksha with sharp arrows and in anger shot five thousand arrows at the five thousand followers of dusana in a moment and sent them to the abode of yama
seeing dusana and his followers killed enraged khara commanded his extremely strong army chiefs this way
dusana and his followers are killed in the battle you all the demons along with your great army and different kinds of weapons should kill that wicked human being rama
having spoken thus angry khara ran towards rama syenagami pruthugriva yajnasatru vihanga durjaya karaveeraksha parusha kalakarmuka meghamali mahamali sarpasya rudhirasanaall these twelve valiant army chiefs along with their forces rushed towards rama releasing the sharpest arrows at him
powerful rama thereafter slayed the remaining army with his weapons studded with gold and diamonds and glowing like fire
the goldtipped arrows which resembled fire covered with smoke shattered the army of demons like huge trees knocked down by thunder
rama killed a hundred demons with one hundred arrows by a single stroke the same way he killed a thousand of them with a thousand arrows on the battle front
the demons fell down on the ground with their shields and ornaments broken their bows stained with blood splintered
the entire ground was littered with bodies of demons fallen in the battle with loose hair and with drops of blood on them looking like a great sacrificial altar strewn all over with kusa grass
with the slaughtered bodies of demons lying on the ground the forest in a moment looked very dreadful like hell with the mud of soil soaked with flesh and blood
fourteen thousand formidable demons were killed by rama a pedestrian human singlehanded
of that entire army great warrior kharatrisira and rama destroyer of foes alone remained
the rest of the mighty dreadful intolerable demons were killed on the war front by rama elder brother to lakshmana
thereafter seeing the formidable army killed by mighty rama khara lifted a thunderbolt like indra and advanced towards rama in a great chariot     thus ends the twentysixth sarga in aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
as khara advanced towards rama trisira the chief of the army approached him and said these words
o valiant one assign this work to me refrain from this audacity see how i am going to put down the mightyarmed rama in the battle
i promise you on my weapon that i will kill ramahe who killed all demons deserves to be slain
restrain yourself for a moment from the enthusiasm to fight the war please act as an arbitrator and see who is killing whom
if rama is killed be happy and go to janasthana or else if i am killed you can fight
when khara was prevailed upon by trisara in that manner with a wish to face death khara permitted him by saying you may go and fightaccordingly he advanced towards rama
trisira who looked a mountain with three peaks also got horses harnessed to a shining chariot and to attack rama proceeded
trisira unleashed a stream of arrows like a huge cloud releasing rain they produced sound a drum drenched with water creates
on seeing demon trisira advancing towards him rama shook sharp arrows off his bow
the tumultuous combat between rama and trisira looked like the strong fight between a lion and an elephant
then rama hit with three arrows on the forehead by trisira flew into a fury and said in a state of great excitement
oh see the strength of this undaunted demon whose arrows fell like flowers on my forehead and only left a scratch
receive the arrows released from my bowstring saying so the angry and agitated rama discharged fourteen arrows venomous like a snake on the chest of trisira
with four arrows having strong joints the mighty hero rama threw down his enemys four swiftfooted horses
rama brought down the charioteer with eight arrows and with one tore down the lofty banner of the chariot to shreds
rama then hit the demon with arrows on his chest while he was running away from the broken chariot the demon became numb
the mighty rama in fury dismembered the heads of that demon with three sharp and swift arrows
the demon with his heads decapitated hit by ramas arrows a little while ago fell down vomitting blood
those surviving demons who were under the protection of khara got scared and retreated fast and fled like deer frightened by a tiger
personally persuading the fleeing army to come back the angry khara leaped forward towards rama just as rahu approaches the moon     thus ends the twentyseventh sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
khara was overtaken by fear at the prowess of rama when he saw dusana and trisira killed
khara the mighty demon saw his large irrepressible army killed he saw trisira and dusana slain singlehanded by rama nervous he advanced towards rama wage war just as namuchi approached indra
khara drew his strong bowstring in anger and released the bloodhungry arrows which appeared like venomous snakes
khara sat on the chariot and with a twang of his bowstring released arrows in all directions exhibiting his skill in the use of weapons
when rama the great warrior saw khara approaching him he fixed powerful arrows on his bow and covered all directions and intermediate quarters with his arrows
he rained sparkling arrows which were irresistible he filled the sky with arrows just as the raingod fills it with rain without leaving any space
the arrows released by khara and rama on one another filled the entire sky everywhere only arrows and no sky could be seen
while they were engaged in the battle eager to kill each other the sky was covered with arrow and the sun could not be seen
then khara shot rama with nalika darts and darts called vikarni like goads hit a mighty elephant
demon khara positioned on the chariot bow in hand appeared to all beings like yama god of death holding the noose
khara thought valiant rama who had destroyed his whole army might be exhausted by now
when rama saw khara aggressively advancing like a lion to attack him he was not perturbed for he knew he was a fawn before a lion which rama was
then khara mounting a great chariot which was glowing like the sun advanced towards rama just as an insect hurtles towards fire
exhibiting his agility of the hand khara shattered the bow and the arrow in the grip of rama the great soul
the influriated khara this time took up seven arrows blazing like indras thunderbolt and hit his armour
the armour of rama who looked radiant like the sun fell on the ground struck by the welljointed darts released by khara
khara then attacked rama of unequal strength in fight with a thousand darts and roared loudly
rama scion of the raghu race afflicted by the darts in all parts of the body glowed in his anger like smokeless fire burning
then rama destroyer of foes strung another great bow of fearful sound in order to put an end to the enemy
thereafter rama advanced aiming at khara the superior vaishnava bow given by sage agastya
rama took up in a rage the welljointed smooth darts with golden feathers and broke the flag post of the chariot of khara to pieces
the beautiful golden flag post broken into several pieces fell down on earthit appeared as if the sun had come down to earth at the behest of the gods
quite enraged khara who knew how to hit the tender parts of the body in an encounter sent out four arrows on rama it was like poking an elephants limbs with a javelin
rama hit by the arrows released from the bow of khara all his limbs drenched in blood became very furious
the best among archers and a supreme shooter he lifted the bow fixed his target and released six arrows in the great fight
rama hit one arrow on the head two on the shoulders and three of the shape of the crescent moon on the chest of the enemy
enraged and effulgent rama took up thirteen darts radiant like the sun with a wish to kill the demon
rama like indra strong and mighty broke the yoke of kharas chariot with one arrow the four horses with four arrows and with the sixth the charioteers head with three others the main pole of the chariot with two the axle of the chariot and with the twelfth kharas bow and arrows were splintered as if laughing at him he pierced kharas body with the thirteenth arrow
then with bow broken chariot destroyed horses and charioteer dead khara jumped down the chariot and stood on the ground holding a mace
then the gods along with great sages came down in aerial chariots and assembled there delighted they adored rama the great warrior with folded hands for the work done     thus ends the twentyeigth sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
effulgent rama looked at khara who stood with a mace in hand minus his chariot and said to him first in a gentle voice and then harshly
although you command a huge army with many elephants horses chariots etc you have done such cruel deeds that the entire world despises you
one who is wicked does sinful deeds and causes distress to all beings will not survive even if he is the lord of the three worlds
o nightranger one who does a horrific deed which is against the world will be killed like an evil serpent come near
whoever commits sinful deeds out of greed or passion and without realisation will be ruined at the end like a lizard that eats hailstone and dies
o demon what benefit will you get by killing the venerable ascetics followers of righteous path residing in dandaka forest
cruel people who are despised by the world for their sinful deeds will not be prosperous for long just like trees with decayed roots
just as the trees bear flowers at the proper season so also people will certainly reap the fruits of their terrible sinful deeds at appropriate time
o nightranger people will reap the result of their sinful actions in this world soon like one eating poisonous food
o nightranger i have come with the orders of the king to put an end to the lives of the perpetrators of dreadful sinful and offensive deeds in this world
now when i unleash the golden arrows they will pierce through your body and come out like serpents emerging from the anthill
slain by me in the battle today you and your army will follow the righteous men eaten by you in dandaka forest
the great seers whom you have earlier tortured and killed will from their aerial vehicles see you fallen into hell
o vile fellow now you may strike at me as you please i will make your head fall down like a palm fruit
challenged by rama in that manner khara his senses switched off eyes turned red due to anger replied laughing
o son of dasaratha it is not praiseworthy to kill ordinary demons in war why do you praise yourself for it
the valiant strong and the best of men do not at all speak proudly of themselves and their valour
o rama common people having no control over themselves and the lowest of kshatriyas boast of themselves in the world in a meaningless way as you are doing now
when death comes in a battle no hero will name his race and boast of himself unnessarily
all your meanness is exhibited by your boasting just as the kusa grass caught by fire appears like gold
indeed it is strange that you do not see me holding a mace and standing here like an unshakeable mountain which contains minerals and supports the earth
just like lord yama holding a noose of death is alone enough to destroy the three worlds i am alone sufficient to take away your life in war a mace in hand
indeed i shall not speak any more even though a lot can be said on you but the sun is about to set and it will be improper to wage war thereafter
you have killed these fourteen thousand demons therefore i will wipe their tears by destroying you
having said this highly enraged khara adorned with large shoulder bands hurled at rama his mace glowing like a thunderbolt
the huge blazing mace hurled by kharas arms reduced the trees and shrubs into ashes and came close to rama
the mace which moved in the sky burning like the noose of death was shattered to pieces by rama
the mace shattered by the arrows of rama fell down scattered to pieces on the ground like a female serpent subdued by the force of mantras and medicine     thus ends the twentyninth sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
rama fond of dharma broke into pieces kharas mace with his arrows and smiling at bewildered khara said
o lowly demon you have already exhibited all your strength inferior to me in energy you are needlessly roaring
the mace about which you boasted so much has betrayed your confidence shattered by my arrows it now lies on the ground
you said you will wipe the tears of the dead demons now those words have proved false
you are mean you have false pride you are of low behaviour i shall take away your life o demon just as garuda carried off the nectar
now with your throat split open by my arrows the earth will drink your foamy blood full of bubbles
with all your limbs covered with dust both the arms dropped down and stretched out on the ground you will sleep as though hugging the earth like embracing a rare woman
when you o vile demon will go into eternal sleep the dandaka grounds will provide shelter to those who deserve it here
o demon when my arrows destroy your hold over janasthana the sages will move freely without fear all over this forest
having lost all their relations the demonesses who were causing fear to otherswill move away with faces full of tears
your wives who have got a husband like you must have been born to a befitting race they will taste the pangs of sorrow today for no reasons whatsoever
o cruel mean vile fellow you had been always opposing the brahmins who pour oblations in fire under fear
when rama was thus speaking in a state of excitement in the middle of war the choleric khara started abusing him in a harsher tone
you are very haughty when there is every cause of fear you pretend fearlessness being in the grip of death you do not know what to speak and what not to speak
those bound by the noose of death do not know what to and what not to do as their six senses cease to function
having said thus to rama with a frown on his face khara looking around for something to strike him with saw a huge sal tree not very far
khara biting his lower lip uprooted the tree lifted it with his mighty arms and shouting at rama loudly hurled it at him saying you are dead
brave rama shattered with a flood of arrows the tree falling over him and summoned sharp anger to end khara in war
full of sweat and with the corners of his eyes turned red rama hit khara with a thousand arrows in the encounter
with his body pierced with arrows his blood started flowing like the waterfalls flow from mount prasravana
completely struck by ramas arrows khara intoxicated with the smell of blood ran speedily charging towards rama
rama who was an adept in the science of arms picked up his valour quickly and moved a step back not to give him an opportunity to strike looking at the highly agitated khara falling upon him with his body fully drenched in blood
rama took a dart glowing like fire which resembled another brahmadanda to kill khara in the war
righteous rama placed on his bow the dart given him by wise indra king of the gods and shot it at khara
bending the bow fully rama released the arrow roaring like a violent gust of wind which fell on kharas chest
just as yama was burnt by rudras firefrom his eyes in swetaranya khara collapsed on the ground consumed by the fire of ramas arrow
khara fell down just like vrutra or bala killed by indras thunderbolt or like numuchi by the froth of the sea
then the rajarsis great seers gathered together offered their worship to rama and said these words joyfully
for this purpose killer of paka the giorious indra who can break a fortress came to the hermitage of sarabhanga
you are brought to this place by the great sages who had cleverly devised a plan to kill the cruel sinners these demons
o son of dasaratha you have accomplished such a task that hereafter the sages in dandaka will discharge their rightful duties happily
meanwhile the wonderstruck gods along with the charanas celestial bards got together and began beating the drums and raining showers of flowers on rama from all sides
in a little more than half a moment of this great war rama had accomplished the terrific task of killing with sharp darts fourteen thousand demons led by khara and dusana
rama who knows the self has performed a great work oh what prowess what efficiency only lord visnu could do this so saying all the gods went back to their respective destinations
in the mean time heroic lakshmana accompanied by sita came out of the mountain cave happily and entered the hermitage
then victorious rama having been worshipped by the seers and also by lakshmana entered the hermitage
on seeing rama killing the enemies of the great sages for their happiness sita felt glad and embraced her husband
sita daughter of janaka was happy to see the demons killed by rama who himself was unhurt
then the daughter of janaka cheerful sita who had a face bright like the moon embraced rama destroyer of demons who was worshipped by the delighted sages      thus ends the thirtieth sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
quickly did akampana leave janasthana and quickly he entered lanka he said to ravana
o king many demons dwelling at janasthana including khara have been killed i manged to escape with much difficulty
when akampana thus reported to the tenheaded ravana his eyes reddened with anger he spoke to akampana as if he was burning him with his eyes
he who has destroyed my beautiful janasthana is sure to die his life is under the control of others his enemies where can he bealive in all the worlds
one who has caused displeasure to me cannot be happy be it indra or kubera or yama or even visnu
i am the destroyer of the destroyer yama i can burn even that which burns fire i can infuse death with the characteristics of death itself
if angry i can burn the sun and even fire with my radiance i can arrest the speed of the wind instantly with my effort
akampana out of fear implored the inflamed ravana with folded hands and faltering voice to spare him
the tenheaded ravana lord of the demons assured safety to akampana who gratefully said these words without hesitation
dasaratha has a young son by name rama he has a body like a lions he has strong round arms and his shoulders resemble those of a bull
he is a hero of great fame and unequal prowess he has destroyed your janasthana and also khara along with dusana
having heard akampanas words ravana the lord of demons sighed heavily like the king of serpents and said these words
did rama come to janasthana with indra and the gods o akampana speak
hearing ravanas words akampana continued telling about great ramas strength and his exploits in war
rama is his name he looks very radiant he is the best among the archers owner of divine weapons he is comparable to indra in war
he is strong with bright red eyes he has a deep voice with the resonance of a drum his face is like the moon lakshmana his younger brother is similar to him in appearance
rama is prosperous he is the best among kings lakshmana with him is like wind with fire rama has pulled down janasthana
indeed they are great men no god came there to lend him a hand there is no need to investigate further about it the goldenfeathered arrows released by rama turned into fivehooded serpents and consumed the demons
wherever the demons went they gripped by fear only saw rama in front o sinless sire in this manner your janasthana was destroyed by him
hearing akampanas words ravana said i will go to janasthana and kill rama along with lakshmana
thus said by ravana akampana responded i will tell you what happened there o king listen to the strength and valour of rama
rama is of great fame when outraged he is irrepressible he can arrest with his arrows even the speed of a river in spate
powerful rama can pull down the sky along with the planets and stars he can lift the drowning earth from the depth of the sea
he is so very powerful that he can drown the earth by breaking the boundary of the sea he can arrest the speed of the sea or of the wind with his arrows
he is a tiger among men he is so powerful that he can destroy the world and recreate the creatures once again by his valour
o tenheaded one just as it is not possible for sinners to attain heaven it is not possible for you or for the entire world of demons to win him in war
i do not think it is possible for gods and demons together to kill him yet there is a way for his destruction you may listen to me with single mindedattention
rama has a wife in this world by name sita who is beautiful has a slender waist and a wellformed body adorned with gems she is a jewel among women
she has no equal among goddesses nor among gandharvis nor apasaras nor among demonesses how can there be a peer of her among human beings
abduct ramas wife by force in that great forest and bereft of sita he will give up his life
ravana the strongarmed king of demons relished the words of akampana and pondering over the matter said to him
yes early in the morning i will go alone gladly with the charioteer and bring vaidehi here to this great city
having said so ravana got on a chariot yoked with donkeys it had the colour of the sun it illuminated all directions ravana left
the great chariot of the demon king ravana flying in the sky shone like the moon in the cloud
ravana reached the hermitage of maricha and met him who was the son of tataka the demon king was treated with food that can be chewed and food that can be eaten
maricha personally offered ravana a seat he offered him water and paid him obeisance making meaningful enquiries he said in appropriate words
o lord of demons o king hope every one is fine in the world of demons o lord though your sudden arrival puts me in doubt about everything going right
having thus been asked by maricha glorious ravana who was eloquent in speech spoke to him
o dear rama who is capable of doing difficult deeds has killed my sentinels the indestructible janasthana has been routed in war could you help me in abudcting his wife that is the only way to bring him to his knees
having heard ravana the king of demons maricha said these words o king who is that enemy of yours who in the guise of a friend has told you about sita though obliged by you who is he that is not happy with you o tiger among demons
tell me who asked you to bring sita who wishes to demolish the peak of the entire clan of demons
he who has encouraged you in this is your enemy indeed he wants you to pluck out the fangs from the serpents mouth
by whose action have you been led into this wrong direction who has hit you on your forehead while you were sleeping comfortably
rama is like a mighty tusker his pure and high birth is his trunk his wellbuilt and strong arms are his tusks his brilliance in his ichor nobody can face this intoxicated elephant in battle
rama is a lion in the form of man a lion on warfront with its tail touching the waist when angry this lion is deft in killing deer in the form of clever demons his body is full of arrows the sharp swords are his pointed teeth it does not behove you to rouse such a lion who is asleep
o king of demons it is not proper for you to jump into the extremely fierce mouth of the nether world known as rama who can steal the bow from his mighty arms which are whirlpools of mud his arrows are rows of waves in the flow of the great war
o lord of lanka chief of the demons be pleased to return to lanka and enjoy yourself in the company of your wives let rama enjoy with his wife in the forest
thus advised by maricha the ten headed ravana returned and entered his best of homes in the city of lanka      thus ends the thirtyfirst sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
seeing dusana khara and also trisira along with the fourteen thousand demon warriors of terrific performance killed by rama singlehanded surpanakha roared like a cloud
seeing the performance of rama which is very difficult for others surpanakha got scared and went to lanka ruled by ravana
surpanakha saw ravana shining brilliantly seated like indra along with ministers and maruts on top of the aerial chariot
ravana sitting on the magnificent golden seat on a golden altar looked radiant like the sun or the blazing fire
invincible to gods gandharvas all living beings great sages and seers he was like yama lord of death with wide open jaws
he had scars of wounds caused by the thunderbolt received in war between gods and demons and marks of scars on his chest made by tips of the the tusks of elephant airavata
valiant ravana had an attractive appearance with beautiful dresses twenty armsten heads a broad chest and brilliant royal marks
wearing burnished golden earrings he looked bright like the glittering vaidurya and with his wellformed arms white teeth and wide mouth he looked like a mountain
he was hit by the wheel of visnu for hundreds of times during great wars and beaten by other weapons
ravana whose body was not hurt by the weapons in war with gods who could perturb even the imperturbable seas was quick in action
he was one who could lift and throw great mountains torment even gods violate dharma at the root and cast an evil eye on the wives of others
he who could employ all divine weapons disrupt sacrifices had gone to the city of bhogavati defeated vasuki and abducted the dear wife of takshaka
ravana went to mount kailasa conquered kubera and took away forcibly his aerial chariot pushpaka which can fly as per the riders desire
out of anger he destroyed all the gardens of gods like chitraratha of kubera full of lotusponds and nandana the pleasuregarden of indra
he was like the peak of a mountain he could stop with his arms the great moon and sun from rising he was a scorcher of enemies
this steadfast ravana who had in the past performed penance for ten thousand years in a dense forest offered his heads to the selfborn brahma
he was unafraid of death in the hands of gods or demons or gandharvas or pisachas or birds or snakes in war except humans
the mighty ravana defiled the sacred soma juice worthy of oblations extracted by brahmins by chanting mantras in scrifices
he disrupted sacrifices at the final stage he killed brahmins he was ruthless harsh and merciless he was involved in activities against human welfare
that demoness surpanakha saw her very strongvaliant brother ravana who made all beings cry and created fear in all worlds
resplendently attired adorned with jewels wearing beautiful gardlands seated on a raised throne heravana was like death to even the lord of death
on reaching ravana the lord of demons the delight of the paulastya dynasty and the destroyer of enemies surrounded by ministers the terrified surpanakha said these words
showing her body disfigured by great lakshmana surpanakha the fearless wanderer overwhelmed with fear said these cruel words to ravana sitting with large glittering eyes     thus ends the thirtysecond sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
when the distressed anguished surpanakha met ravana who makes the world weep he was seated in the midst of his ministers she addressed him these harsh words
intoxicated with the pleasures of passion acting on your own ungoaded and unguided you do not understand the problems arising out of great fear problems you ought to know
lustful and greedy you are addicted to vulgar pleasures people will not respect you like the fire on the crematorium
a king who does not act at the right time will be ruined along with the kingdom and its works
just as elephants keep away from a muddy river people will keep distance from the king who does not employ spies does not give audience to his people and is not independent
kings who are not under their own control and cannot protect the country do not attract the minds of the people like mountains inside sea water
having created enmity with selfrespecting persons like gods gandharvas and demons with a fickle mind and without spies how long can you continue as king
o demon you are childish and foolish you do not even know what ought to be known how can you rule as a king
the best among the victorious kings who are not masters of their espionage judicial system and their exchequer are equal to the laity
since kings can see things from a faroff place with the help of the spies they are called farsighted
since you have not engaged any spy you do not know when your own relatives were killed in janasthana i take you to be a fool surrounded by ordinary ministers
one rama alone killed all the fourteen thousand demons including dusana and khara demons capable of fierce exploits
rama the effortless performer of formindable tasks has assured safety to the sages peace and happiness was restored to dandaka forest but janasthana has been ravaged
o ravana you are not aware of what has happened to your own kingdom you are avaricious intoxicated and under others control a great fear has been generated in your own kingdom
all living beings stop seeking refuge under a king who is not a generous giver but intoxicated harsh arrogant and fraudulent they do not run to him for protection in times of calamity
a king who is extremely arrogant who is not acceptable to good people who is selfconceited and cholerictempered will be murdered even by his own people at the time of adversity
a king who does not do what ought to be done does not fear what ought to be feared will surely be dislodged from the kingdom and live a wretched life like a blade of grass
even dried up logs or clods of earth or a handful of dust may have some value but not a king who is dethroned
like a piece of cloth that is worn and discarded like garlands put on and crushed a king dislodged from the kingdom is worthless even if he is capable
a king who is alert omniscient has control over his senses has a sense of gratitude and one of righteous conduct continues to rule for a long time
the king who keeps both his eyes shut but keeps the eye of justice open one who is free from anger and remains ever alert is worshipped by the people
o ravana you are evilminded you are devoid of all these good qualities your spies could not know that there had been a great massacre of your fellowdemons
a king who accuses others who is addicted to sensual pleasures who lacks a sense of judgement of place and time a sense of discrimination between virtue and vice and the right wisdom will destroy himself and the kingdom in no time
ravana king of demons wealthy arrogant and mighty listened to surpanakha and pondered over the mistakes she mentioned     thus ends the thirtythird sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
incensed at the harsh words surpanakha used in the midst of ministers ravana said
who is rama what is his strength how does he look how valiant is he for what purpose has he entered the impenetrable dandaka forest
with what weapons he has killed demons like khara dusana and trisira
thus questioned by ravana the demoness overcome by anger began telling him about rama faithfully
rama dasarathas son has long arms large eyes he is clad in deerskin and bark he resembles cupid
his bow resembles indras he is adorned with gold bands drawing the bow he releases glittering arrows like highly poisonous snakes
i could not see rama in the dreadful war while he was pulling an arrow from the quiver aiming the dart and drawing the bowstring
just as indra destroys the crop ready for harvest by raining hailstones i have seen rama killing the army with a shower of arrows
fighting alone on foot with his sharp arrows rama killed within a span of one and a half muhurta the fourteen thousand dreadful demons including dusana and khara
sages have been assured safety peace has been restored to dandaka forest as rama the great soul who knows the self hesitated to kill a woman i was alone saved after this humiliation
his brother called lakshmana looks radiant he is virtuous and courageous like him valiant devoted and loyal
he is impatient invincible victorious bold intelligent and strong he is even the right hand of rama his outer life
ramas beloved consort is a largeeyed lady her face is like the full moon she is engaged in the wellbeing of her husband
she is an illustrious lady she is goodlooking with her long hair wellshaped nose and things she appears to be the presiding deity of the forest another goddess of wealth laxmi
she is sita princess of videha a virtuous lady of golden complexion a beautiful lady of slender waist and heavy hips
i had not seen such a beautiful woman earlier among the gandharvas or yakshas or kinneras i have not seen such a beauty among the humans on earth
whosoever gets sita as his wife whoever she embraces happily will wish to live longer than indra the breaker of fortresses in this world
she is a woman of good conduct of praiseworthy beauty she is matchless in her beauty on earth she will be a suitable wife for you and you a suitable husband for her
o mightyarmed one i have been disfigured by cruel lakshmana as i was attempting to bring that lady of broad thighs pointed breasts heavy hips and a beautiful face to make her your wife
if you see her today this lady with a face like the fullmoon you will instantaneously fall a victim to the arrows of the god of love
if you intend her to be your wife raise your right foot now and proceed to win her over
o lord of the demons do a favour to your clan by killing that cruel rama dwelling in the hermitage
kill rama that great warrior along with lakshmana with sharp arrows and enjoy the company of sita happily as you like with her husband dead
if you like what i have said do accordingly without any hesitation o ravana lord of the demons
assess your own strength o lord of the demons before you forcefully abduct that delicate sita who is charming in all respects and make her your wife
on hearing about the death of the demons including khara and dusana who fell to the straight and swift arrows of rama you should decide your course of action     thus ends the thirtytfourth sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
then hearing the horripilating words of surpanakha ravana took leave of the ministers and went thinking about the task ahead of him
deliberating on the task ahead duly considering the pros and cons demerits and merits strength and weakness of the issue and having firmly decided within himself he left for the beautiful coachshed
ravana went covertly to the coachshed and to the charioteer to get a chariot harnessed
thus ordered the smart charioteer got the chariot of his choice harnessed in an instant
the younger brother of kubera ravana the prosperous lord of the demons ascended the chariot which could go where he desired embellished with gold studded with gems harnessed with demonfaced donkeys the chariot rolled towards the ocean rumbling like a cloud
ravana enemy of the gods slayer of towering sages with white yaktail fans and white parasols shining like smooth vaidurya wearing pure gold earrings clad in attractive attire ten necks with twenty strong hands ten heads looking like ten mountain peaks a cloud in the sky encircled by lightnings and accompanied by cranes ascended the chariot that could go wherever he desired
valiant ravana wentwatching the mountains full of thousands of trees bearing flowers and fruits on the shore of the sea
the area surrounded on all sides with lotusladen ponds filled with cool sacred water sprawling hermitages with elevated altars
the place covered with banana plants and coconut trees as well as blossoming sal and tamala trees was looking extremely beautiful
the place looked charming with nagas garudas gandharvas kinneras in their thousands and with the descendants of ajas vaikhanasas valakhilyas and with those who drink the rays of sun and moon for survival with sages who were highly disciplined in the intake of food spiritually accomplished and selfcontrolled hermits and charanas
the place was full of apsaras in their thousands and paragons of beauty adorned with divine ornaments and garlands and experts in lovesports
it was chosen by prosperous wives of gods as a reosrt hosts of gods and demons were wandering there in the hope of tasting nectar
it was full of small floats flocks of swans kraunchas sarasas cackling in the ponds with great joy it had stretches of vaidurya stones on the shore and shone with the radiance of the sea
speeding along the brother of kubera ravana saw palewhite spacious aerial chariots on all sides controlled by those who had conquered the higher worlds by their penances these chariots decked with heavenly garlands and ringing with divine music could fly where one desired he saw gandharvas and apsaras as well
he saw thousands of tree trunks with finesmelling resins and sandalwood trees
he saw very fine aguru trees in the forest as well as pleasuregroves of takkola fruits fragrant trees of a fine variety and fragrant nutmegs
he saw tamala flowers in bloom pepper shrubs in clusters and hoards of pearls kept for drying on the shores
he saw stretches of conches heaps of corals and mounds of gold and silver too
he went watching fascinating waterfalls pleasing ponds cities filled with wealth and grain looking splendid with beautiful women and full of elephants horses and chariots
it was a veritable heaven with the plain land flooded with the backwaters of the sea and gentle breeze blowing
he saw a banyan tree with its branches spread on all sides measuring a hundred yojanas looking like a cloud and providing shelter to the sages
in the past the mighty garuda brought an elephant and a huge tortoise and sat on a branch of this tree to feed on them
due to the weight of this best of birds the mighty garuda the leafy branch at once broke down
gathered together under the great tree were great sages like vaikhanasas mashas marichipas valakhilyas ajas and dhumras
out of compassion for the endangered seers garuda carried away that hundredyojanalong branch along with the elephant and the tortoise with great speed
righteous garuda the best among the birds stood on one foot and ate the flesh of elephant and tortoise and with the branch of the tree destroyed the settlement of the demons over the destruction of the demons and deliverance of the great seers he felt immeasurable happiness
quite happy his energy redoubled wise garuda made up his mind to obtain nectar
twisting and twirling the grills of the window he broke open the room made of gems and quietly carried away the nectar from indras mansion
ravana the younger brother of kubera beheld that banyan tree called subhadram which was a favoured resort of the sages bearing the ensignia of garuda
ravana crossed over to the other side of the sea the lord of rivers and beheld a hermitage in a beautiful secluded sacred place in the middle of the forest
there he saw a demon maricha by name clad in dark deerskin and bark with matted hair and living on restricted food
when king ravana reached there maricha received him in accordance with tradition and made worshipful offering to the king fulfilling all his superhuman desires
maricha extended his hospitality with appropriate food and water and said with meaningful words
o king o lord of the demons hope all is well in lanka what brings you here again so soon
thus addressed by maricha the effulgent eloquent ravana replied with these words     thus ends the thirtyfifth sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
o dear maricha hear my words i am distressed and you are my ultimate refuge
you know that my brothers khara and dusana the strongarmed heroes my sister surpanakha and the mighty cannibal trisira and many other heroic demons successful in hitting their targets are bonafide residents they have been harassing the followers of righteous path the sages at my behest
these fourteen thousand heroes perpetrators of terrible deeds skilled in hitting the targets had been acting according to the direction of khara
these mighty demons living in janasthana eqipped with different kinds of weapons supported and led by khara met rama in an encounter
with his wrath generated rama without even speaking anything used his bow and the arrows
being a human being who fought on foot he killed fourteen thousand ferocious demons with his sharp arrows
khara dusana and trisira were killed in warthe residents of dandaka forest are rendered safe and fearless
rama a victim of his fathers anger banished into the forest with his wife a shortlived mortal and a calumny on the kshatriyas has killed the army of demons
he is a man of bad conduct harsh sharptonged stupid miserly and a slave to his senses he is immoral and unrighteous one who is busy harming others
with no enmity whatsoever merely because he has strength he cut off the nose and ears of my sister and mutilated her his wife sita is like the daughter of heaven i would like to abduct her with force from janasthana for which you should be my accomplice
you are mighty i do not care to fight even the gods when you and my brothers are by my side therefore o demon be my accomplice i know you are capable of that
in valour in war and in conceit there is no one equal to you you know all means of success you are great you are brave you are an expert in all deceitful arts
i have come to you for this purpose seeking your help listen to my words on what you should do
be a wonderful golden deer dappled with silver dots and roam in front of sita in ramas hermitage
seeing you in the form of a deer sita will undoubtedly ask her husband and lakshmana to capture you
then during their absence it will be easy for me to abduct sita in an isolated place without obstruction like rahu eclipsing the light of the moon
thereafter when rama with his soul afflicted due to his wifes abduction i can freely happily successfully strike him down
at the mention of ramas name great marichas mouth dried up and he became concerned
licking his dried up lips as though his eyes stopped winking like those of the dead maricha stared at ravana distressed
maricha who knows of ramas valour was frightened and depressed at heart he revealed to ravana with folded hands some facts for mutual benefit      thus ends the thirtysixth sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
having heard the words of ravana lord of the demons wise maricha who was also an eloquent speaker replied
o king it is always easy to find men who speak pleasing words but it is difficult to get a speaker and a listener who use words unpleasant to the ears but beneficial in life
you are fickleminded you have employed no spy who could have told you the truth about ramas character rama is very brave and virtuous comparable to indra and varuna surely you are not able to know what rama is
o dear may there be good to all the demons in the world if rama gets enraged he will make this world demonless
hope the daughter of janaka is not born to put an end to your life hope i will not face any disaster on account of sita
i hope the city of lanka along with the entire race of demons will not be destroyed with a dictator like you who is a slave to sensual pleasure
a king who is a slave to passion who is of bad conduct of wicked thoughts advised in evil ways destroys himself his kith and kin and the entire kingdom
rama the delight of kausalya has not forsaken by his father he has never crossed the limits of dharma he is not miserly he has no bad conduct he is not a slur on the kshatriyas he does not lack in righteousness he is not cruel nor is he engaged in doing harm to others
o dear seeing that his truthful father was going to be deceived by kaikeyi righteous rama himself offered to fulfil the promise of his father and came away to the forest
to satisfy the desire of kaikeyi and to fulfil his fathers word he came to dandaka forest leaving the kingdom and all royal pleasures behind
o my dear rama is not harsh nor ignorant it is not that he has no control over the senses it is not proper for you to say what is false you are illinformed
rama is dharma incarnate he is pious his strength is truth he is king of all the worlds like indra to the gods
sita is protected by the strength of her character how do you desire to carry her away forcibly from rama can any one separate the radiance of the sun from the sun itself
you should not enter into the unquenchable fire that is rama the fire that has the arrows of rama as its flames and his sword and bow as fuel
you should not give up happinessyour dear life and kingdom and come to rama who is a variable god of death his bow is like on open burning mouth and his flaming arrows are like fire he is all anger he is wielder of bow and arrows he can strike the enemy army alone
immeasurable indeed is the power of rama to whom sita daughter of janaka belongs you are not competent to kidnap her for she is under the refuge of ramas bow in the forest
beautiful sita happens to be the wife of rama who is like a lion among men rama has a broad chest like that of a lion he loves sita who is ever loyal to him more than his life
sita is the darling of mighty rama with her slender waist she is like the leaping flames of blazing fire and it is not possible for you to touch her
o chief of the demons why do you make this futile attempt the moment you are seen by rama in war will be the last of your life
if you want to enjoy your life happiness and even the kingdom which is not easily attainable for long do not incur the displeasure of rama
after consulting all your ministers and the righteous persons led by vibhisana you may take a decision assess the real strength and weakness merits and demerits of your own and of rama decide what is good or bad for you and then take steps you deem proper
o ravana i think it is not good on your part to confront the prince of kosala in a war listen to my words and consider what is good for you      thus ends the thirtyseventh sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
once i was roaming the earth like a mountain possessing the strength of a thousand elephants like a dark cloud wearing bright gold earrings and crownholding a spear in hand terrorising the people i was wandering in dandaka forest feeding on the flesh of ascetics
hence the great sage righteous visvamitra afraid of me went to king dasaratha and said
o king maricha has created in me a great fear spare the self possessed rama to protect me while i do the sacrifice
when the great venerable sage visvamitra said so the righteous king dasaratha replied
my son rama is only twelve he is not experienced in the use of weapons i shall accompany you with my army
o distinguished sage with the four divisions of my army i will slay the enemies you want me to
when the king thus responded to the sage he told him that none other than rama in this world is a match for that demon
o king you have protected even gods in wars and have been a guardian your deeds are very wellknown in the three worlds
o scourge of foes as you wish let your great army wait here even though rama is young he is glorious and capable of subduing the enemy i will take him be blessed
sage visvamitra saying so took the son of the king and went back very happily to his hermitage
then rama was initiated for the protection of sacrifices and stood on guard stretching his wonderful bow
thereafter handsome rama with eyes like lotus petals beards ungrown clad in a single garment with knotted hair on the head wielding a bow with a chain of gold luminous with his own lustre enhanced the glory of dandaka forest by looking like the young moon just risen
then looking like a dark cloud wearing bright golden earrings proud of power bestowed on me with boons i arrived at the hermitage
i entered at once and lifted my weapons rama saw me and unperturbed started stringing his bow
out of my delusion i underestimated the young boy and screaming ran towards visvamitras sacrificial altar
then rama released a sharp arrow that could kill the enemy it struck me and threw me at a distance of hundred yojanas into the sea
o dear being thrown away by the speed of his dart i lost my consciousness i was protected by rama who did not want to kill me
o dear i was thrown into the deep sea and after a long time regained consciousness and returned to the city of lanka
that way i was spared by the young boy who was not versed in archery and who could still accomplish the task with easethose who accompanied me were destroyed
if you pick up conflict with rama even while being warned by me you will soon face a dreadful calamity
you will bring grief and disaster into the lives of demons who are sporting in love and who are in the habit of celebrating community festivals with joy
you will see the city of lanka dotted with magnificent royal mansions embellished with different kinds of gems ruined for the sake of sita
even without committing any sin those pure souls because they keep company with sinners will be destroyed for the sins of others just like fishes in a pool of serpents
you will see the demons who smear their limbs with sandal paste and unguents who are adorned with excellent ornaments slain and laid on the ground for your mistakes
you will see the rest of the demons with their wives gone or fleeing in all directions helplessly with none to take care of them
you will undoubtedly see lanka filled with arrows surrounded by flames of fire and its buildings on fire
o king there is no sin greater than violating the chastity of others wives when you have married a thousand lovely women
enjoy with your wives protect your race prestige kingdom prosperity and your own dear life
if you wish to enjoy your beautiful wives and your good friends for long do not create enmity with rama
if you violate sita forcibly notwithstanding my friendly warning your life will be drained by the arrows of rama and you will reach the abode of yama with your kith and kin your strength depleted     thus ends the thirtyeighth sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
i was somehow saved by him this way in the combatlisten without any reply to what has taken place recently
having done so i picked up courage and entered dandaka forest accompanied by the two other demons in the form of deer
i wandered in dandaka forest in the form of a huge animal with a big and strong body a flaming red tongue and sharp teeth feeding on flesh
o ravana assuming a very dreadful form i wandered about sacrificial spots sacred places river banks under huge trees planted at quadranglestorturing the ascetics
i wandered about the dandaka forest slaying righteous ascetics drinking their blood and eating their flesh
while thus roaming i harmed the wanderers of the forest intoxicated with their blood i used to frighten the righteous
i encountered again the righteous rama who was in the form of an ascetic with venerable sita and the great warrior lakshmana
although rama was very strong he was living on restricted diet engaged in the welfare of all beings treating him as a mere ascetic living in the forest remembering my past hostility with him and disregarding his fatal blow i ran towards him angrily assuming the form of a sharphorned animal with an intention to kill him
his mighty bow drawn rama released three sharp darts that came whizzing like garuda or the wind they could destroy the enemy
all the three tightly jointed welltargetted darts strong as thunderbolt and which could feed on blood came together all at once
having known ramas prowess earlier and experienced tremendous fear i ran away in a bewildered state as i was deceitful the other two demons who had accompanied me succumbed
with my escape from ramas darts i somehow got a fresh lease of life now i am composed i have started living the life of a recluse here i have turned an ascetic
i see rama in every tree clad in bark and deerskin wielding the bow holding a noose in hand like the god of death
o ravana i see in my fear thousands of ramas the entire forest appears to me as though filled with rama
o king of the demons i see only rama even in solitude when i see him in a dream i lose my senses in a state of bewilderment
o ravana every name beginning with the letter ra such as ratna gems ratha chariot etc strike terror in me
i know his powerit is not proper to wage a war with him rama delight of the raghu dynasty can slay even bali or namuchi
missing
there were many pious men in this world who practise yoga and dharma they have been destroyed along with their retinue due to mistakes committed by others
o demon as such i will perish due to your offence you may do anything you deem appropriate i will not follow you
rama is brilliant powerful and strong i hope he will not be the god of death for the world of demons
for the sake of surpanakha khara of janasthana committed excesses and got killed by rama who can accomplish things with easetell me truly if rama did violate anything here
if you do not follow my advice given for the welfare of our kith and kin o ravana you are killed today with your relations you will succumb to his straightmoving arrows     thus ends the thirtyninth sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
the demon ravana did not heed the appropriate advice of the competent maricha just like a man wishing to die refuses medicine
the king of the demons driven by fate replied with improper and harsh words to maricha whose advice was salutary and beneficial to him
o maricha the words addressed to me are not appropriateyour advice is extremely fruitless like a seed sown in saline barren soil
it is not possible to dissuade me from my encounter with rama who is sinful foolish and especially an ordinary human being
on hearing the casual words of a woman this rama came to the forest at once leaving his friends kingdom mother and father
in your very presence i will surely abduct sita wife of rama who killed khara in war sita whom he loves more than his life
o maricha i have made up my mind that way even demons or deities including indra cannot alter this decision of mine
if i asked you the merits or demerits the risks involved or the way out while deciding a case you should have said what you did
a wise counsellor should give advice to the king only when his opinion is sought and that too with folded hands if he wishes his own prosperity
a king should be addressed with politeness and decorum with words not unfavourble intended for his good luck and wellbeing
a king who deserves honour does not feel happy to hear even good words of advice if said in disrespectful or authoritarian way o maricha
very powerful kings assume five forms like fire indra moon varuna and yama
great kings possess heat of the firegod valour of indra coolness of the moon command of varuna and grace of the lord of death therefore kings at all stages deserve respect and reverence
you do not know your rightful dutybecause of delusion and an evil mind you want to speak only harsh words to me a guest who has come to you
o demon o extremely valiant demon i ask youto do this much now i am not asking you whether it is good or bad or whether it is for my welfare or not
you have to help me in accomplishing this great task hear me on the kind of work you have to do
missing
transform yourself into a wonderful golden deer with silver spots and move about in front of sita at the hermitage of rama after fascinating her you may go whereever you desire
seeing the illusory golden deer sita wonderstruck will at once ask rama to get the deer
divert rama to a faroff place and cry alas sita alas lakshmana imitating the voice of rama
on hearing you lakshmana will be bewildered urged by sita and out of love for rama lakshmana will follow the same track as rama
when rama and lakshmana are away i will comfortably abduct vaidehi like the thousandeyed indra brought sachi
you may go wherever you want after accomplishing this task i will give you o demon of determination half my kingdom
go and accomplish this task let your path be auspicious i will follow you on the chariot into the dandaka forest
i will deceive rama and obtain sita without waging a war with the work done i will return to lanka along with you
o maricha if you do not do this i will kill you now or by force make you do this work no one who goes against the king lives in comfort
your survival is doubtful after facing rama in combat but your death is certain if you oppose me now think carefuly and do whatever is desirable for you in the present circumstances     thus ends the fortieth sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
at this royal command which was against his interest maracha used harsh words to the demonking
who is that sinner who has given you this advice which will spell destruction on you your sons your kingdom and your ministers
which sinner is not able to see you happy o king by whom is this gate of death shown to you cunningly
this is clear that your enemy demons are now powerless hence they want you to be engaged with a stronger power and be destroyed
o ravana by which mean fellow is this advice given against your welfare who wants you to be destroyed by your own action
o ravana the ministers should have prevented you by all means from adopting this wrong path since they have not done so they deserve to be spain
good ministrers should always prevent a lustful king from taking resourse to an evil path why were you not stopped even though you deserve to be checked
o ravana the best among the successful ministers attain piety prosperity pleasures and fame by the grace of the king
otherwise evrything will become useless o ravana others will suffer calamities on account of their masters vices
o ravana the best among the victorious indeed the king is at the root of righteousness and victorytherefore the king should be protected by all at every stage
o nightwalking demon a kingdom cannnot be governed by a king who is rude or hostile or impolite
ministers who adopt improper strategies go down along with the king just like swift horses driven by a slow charioteer on a rugged terrain
persons who walk the righteous path go down in this world along with their kith and kin due to the mistakes committed by others
o ravana people who are ruled by a cruel and hostile king will not grow like the sheep protected by a jackal
under a rude crooked king whose senses are not under his control the demons will surely perish
i am faced with this dreadful disaster accidentally you will not only be in a miserable state because of your misdeeds you will perish along with your army
rama will kill you not long after killing mehence even if i die in the hands of the enemy my desire will be fulfilled
yu most understand that if i die at the very sight of rama you along with your relatives will perish with the abduction of sita
if you bring sita from the hermitage with my assistance know that none of us will surviveyou nor i nor lanka nor the demons
o ravana you do not understand this word of warning coming from your wellwisher men who are going to die do not heed the advice given by their friends     thus ends the fortyfirst sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
having thus spoken to the demonking the distressed maricha said out of fear let both of us go
if that warrior rama carrying bow arrows and sword sees me once again he will raise his weapon to kill me and i will cease to be
no one who exhibits his heroism before rama will come back alive to you already hit by yamas staff he is another form of the same yama
what can i do if you remain evilminded o dear demon i am going may your path be auspicious
ravana was so overwhelmed with joy to hear those words that he embraced him tightly and said
act according to my wish it befits your valour you were a different demon earlier now you are maricha
ascend quickly with me this chariot encrusted with gems and yoked with donkeys with devils faces
you may go whereever you like after tempting vaidehi when the princess of mithila is alone i will bring her by force
thereafter ravana and maricha ascended the chariot which was like an aerial car and quickly departed from that cluster of hermitages
and likewise they went past towns forests mountains streams states and cities
ravana king of the demons accompanied by maricha then reached dandaka forest and saw ramas hermitage
then ravana got off the chariot decorated with golden embellishments and holding marichas hand said
o friend here is the site of the hermitage surrounded by banana plants quickly get to work on the purpose for which we have come
hearing ravanas words maricha transformed himself into a deer and started moving at the entrance of ramas hermitage
maricha assumed the form of a wonderful and magnificent deer with his antlers studded with the most precious gems his face dappled with luminous spots of white and black
the deers face was like a pink lotus his ears were like blue lotus his neck slightly raised his lips were like petals of blue lotus
his bright belly was shining like kunda flowers or the moon or diamond his flanks were like the golden madhuka flowers comparable to the filaments of lotus his hooves were like vaidurya and his legs were slim and willshaped
his tail stood up looking magnificent like a colourful rainbow bedecked with various gems he shone beautiful
transformed into a most beautiful deer in a moment maricha brightened the beautiful forest and ramas hermitage
transfigured into a beautiful magnificent form painted with the colours of different minerals in order to tempt sita maricha roamed all around the grassland
that deer with hundreds of silver spots on the body appeared enchanting and pleasing to the eyes while he wandered about nibbling the tender leaves of trees
the deer went wandering about the banana groves surrounding ramas hermitage and moved slowly towards the karnikara trees in order to catch the attention of sita
that magnificent deer glittered with the colour of blue lotus on its back wandered merrily in the vicinity of ramas hermitage
the wonderful deer moved to and fro now disappearing and now swiftly returning
the deer is now sporting now sitting on the ground now standing at the entrance of the hermitage and now running with the herds of deer
followed by herds of deer and coming back to see sita again and again the deer cavorted and pranced and frisked in circles in a wonderful way
seeing the deer other animals wandering in the forest come near and sniffing him run away in all ten directions
the demon who was interested in killing wild deer touched and felt them but did not kill or feed on them in order to hide his intention
in the mean time sita who with her auspicious looks was busy plucking flowers drew near the trees
with her bewitching eyes and beautiful face sita went about plucking flowers from karnikara ashoka and mango trees
the great lady sita unworthy of dwelling in the forest saw the wonderful deer decked with gems with spots of pearls all over the body
a lady with beautiful teeth and lips sita saw the deer having silver and mineral coloured hair on the body she gazed at the animal with wonder and joy and love
that illusory deer saw ramas wife and moved around wonderfully as if illuminating the forest with his radiance
seeing such an unprecedented deer decorated with different gems sita daughter of janaka stood amazed     thus ends the fortysecond sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
sita while plucking flowers sita who had fine hips flawless beautiful limbs and pure golden complexion felt delighted to see the deer with gold and silver colours on both sides of his body she called out to rama and lakshmana who were equipped with arms
when sita called rama and lakshmana the two tigers among men they looked around and saw the deer
seeing the deer lakshmana suspected him to be maricha and said this to rama
many kings while on hunting expedition in the forest have been deceitfully killed by malicious maricha who could assume any form at his free will
o tiger among men this deceitful demon maricha has been transformed into the illusory form of a radiant deer which does not exist
o rama lord of the world nowhere on earth does exist this kind of wonderful deer sparkling with gems that it is a mere trick an illusion there is no doubt
sita was too enchanted by the skin of the deer to retain her sense of discrimination intervening she said to rama joyfully with a pure smile on her face
o prince o longarmed one this deer has captivated my mind fetch him for methis will be our playmate
here at the hermitage there are many lovely deer yaks and antelopes wandering in herds
o longarmed one most beautiful animals like bears antelopes and groups of monkeys and kinneras are wandering here
o prince this kind of beautiful tame and glittering deer i have never seen before
its body glittering with different colours speckled with gems of different kinds is like the moon shining and illuminating the forest
oh what a beauty oh what rich call what delightful wonderful graceful limbs this deer captivates my heart
if this deer can be caught alive it will be thrilling it will work wonders
after the completion of exile in the forest when we are back in the kingdom this deer will add beauty to the harem
o king this deer will create amazement in bharata in mothersinlaw in you and in me as well
o best among men if this great deer cannot be captured alive i will wear its beautiful skin
if this animal is killed and its golden skin is spread on a tender grass cushion there will i like to sit
this kind of request arising out of a womans desire may sound terrible still then the beauty of this animals skin has produced in me a wonder
by his golden colour resembling the rising sun by his horns with excellent gems shining like the milkyway even ramas mind was wonderstruck
on hearing sitas words and seeing the wonderful deer rama was tempted by its appearanceprompted by sitahe joyfully said this to lakshmana
o lakshmana see the eagerness of sita such a deer of exceptional beauty will not be found in this forest there is no equal to this animal even in the nandan garden of indra or the chaitraratha the garden of kubera where can such an animal be found on earth
the stretches of hair on the deers body bent both in the natural order and in the opposite direction look beautiful the spots of gold on the skin are wonderful
look at his tongue stretched out of the mouth while yawning it is glowing like flaming fire it is like the lightning sparkling in the cloud
his face is a drinking pot of emerald the belly is a conch or a pearl whose mind will not be attracted by this indescribable beauty
whose mind will not be filled with wonder on seeing this divine beauty glittering like lustrous gold and studded with a variety of gems
o lakshmana kings who wield bows in hunting expeditions kill deer in the forest for sport as well as for venison
from huge forests a variety of mineral wealth consisting of gems stones and gold are collected with great effort
o lakshmana the essence of forest wealth is mineral wealth which helps the growth of the treasury it is conceived mentally as in the case of venus
a materialist moves about thoughtlessly for making money economists call it material wealth
the skins of various types of deer like priyaki kadali or goats or sheep cannot be compared in softness to the skin of this deer
this majestic deer and the deer flying in heaven the deers figure seen in the moon called mrgasira both the deer of the star in the sky and the deer of the earth are divine
lakshmana as you say if it is the illusion of a demon even then it should be killed by me
the great sages were tortured and killed earlier by this cruel evilminded maricha while wandering in the forest
many kings who were great archers who set out on hunting expedition were killed by him therefore this animal deserves to be killed
earlier in this forest vatapi used to humiliate the ascetic brahmins and to kill them by entering into their stomach like a womb killing the female mule
that vatapi after a long time once greedily entered into the stomach of the great lustrous sage agastya and became his food
when the venerable sage agastya got up after eating he observed vatapi wishing to turn into his real form so smiling at him he said
o vatapi you killed the best of brahmins living in this world disregarding them because of your power hence you were digested by me
o lakshmana just like vatapi this demon will not live whoever violates a person of my kind who is ever righteous and selfcontrolled will be killed
o lakshmana delight of the raghu dynasty be very alert and restrained and protect sita whatever duty we have to perform depends on her protection
o lakshmana i will go quickly and either kill the deer or catch it now let me go
see how vaidehi ardently longs for the skin of this deer i will not let the animal live o lakshmana
keep vigil over sita at the hermitage o lakshmana i will certainly kill the speckled antelope with a single arrow get his skin and come back quickly
o lakshmana be vigilant in guarding sita suspecting danger every moment from all directions take the help of jatayu the mighty and wise bird who will be on his rounds     thus ends the fortythird sarga in aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
the brilliant rama delight of the raghu dynasty thus instructed his brother and fastened a sword with a golden handle to his waist
a man of indomitable prowess he took the bow with three curves that was like an ornament to him tied two quivers at the back and left
on seeing rama approaching him the deer disappeared due to fear and again came within sight with his sword and the bow rama chased wherever the deer ran
rama wielder of the bow saw that splendid animal ahead of him holding the bow he saw the deer running away bewldered into the great forest looking at him again and again the deer was getting out of the range of his arrow while it enticed him now and then suspecting that he might be caught the deer was as though jumping into the sky now it came within sight and now out of sight in the huge forest it looked like the autumnal moon surrounded by clouds the clouds muffle the moon and reveal him now and then
maricha transformed into a deer was seen now near now faroff he pulled rama away from the hermitage through his exits and entrances
deluded by that deer rama got tired perplexed and angry then bewidered he waited on a grassland under a shade
that demon transformed himself into a deer and surrounded by the animals of the forest at close range attracted his attention
seeing ramas intention to catch him the deer ran away once again out of fear and disappeared in a moment
resplendent rama saw the deer coming out of a cluster of trees at a distance and determined to kill him
powerful rama destroyer of foes lifted in a rage his arrow blazing like the light of the sun strung it to his sturdy bow and drew it with all his force he then aimed at the deer and released the shining arrow created by brahma which went hissing like a serpent
the great arrow which was like a thunderbolt first pierced into the body of maricha who had assumed the form of a deer and then tore his heart
and hurt by the dart maricha roared frighteningly leaped as high as a palm tree and dropped down on earth almost dead
maricha gave up his false form of the deer and before breathing his last remembered the words of ravana he thought over the means through which sita could send lakshmana to this spot so that ravana would abduct her when she is alone
then maricha realised that the appropriate time had come in a voice similar to ramas he shouted loudly alas sita alas lakshmana
struck in the vital part by ramas matchless dart maricha gave up the form of the deer and assumed his huge body of the demon
seeing that terrific demon fallen on the ground drenched in blood and strring his limbs rama thought of lakshmanas words and reached sita mentally thought of her
this is an illusion created by maricha it happened exactly the way lakshmana had said earlier maricha is now killed
this demon maricha screamed aloud saying alas sita alas lakshmana he is now dead how would sita react to this voice what would be the condition of lakshmana while righteous rama reflected on this his hair stood on end
after killing the demon in the figure of a deer and hearing his voice rama was overtaken by intense fear born of despair
then rama killed another deer collected the venison and hastened to janasthana     thus ends the fortyfourth sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
on hearing the voice in distress and recognising that it was similar to her husbands voice sita said to lakshmana go and find out ramas whereabouts
i clearly heard rama calling out in great distress indeed my heart as well as my life is not in its place restless you ought to go and protect your brother who is crying in pain in the forest
like a bull caught by lions your brother is seeking help caught by demons you should run at once to your brother
when he did not budge in obedience to his brothers order to protect sita the daughter of janaka in a rage said
since you o son of sumitra are not reaching out to your brother in this situation you are an enemy to your brother in the guise of a friend
it is possess me that you wish ramas death you do not rush to him certainly because of greed for me
i think ramas adversity is welcome to you you do not have any love towards your brother it is for this that you stand unconcerned instead of proceeding to help your brilliant brother
when he for whose service you have primary come here has met with difficulty what is the use of your being here what purpose you serve by staying here with me
while sita thus spoke flooded with tears of sorrow frightened like a doe lakshmana replied
o vaidehi there is no doubt that pannagas asuras gandharvas gods men or even demons cannot defeat him
o brilliant devi none among gods or men gandharvas birds or goblins kinnaras wild animals or dreadful demons can encounter rama in war
rama is indestructible in war it is not proper for you to say what you said when he is not here i do not wish to leave you alone here in the forest
he cannot be stopped by the strength of the mighty or by indra supported by gods or by the wellequipped armies of all the three worlds
may your heart be relieved of this fear give up this grief your husband will soon return with the excellent deer killed
surely it is not his voice it is contrived by some ones illusory power it is the illusion created by that demon like the city of the gandharvas which does not exist
o best of women vaidehi great rama has entrusted your safty to me i do not wish to leave you here alone
o vaidehi since the killing of khara and the residents of janasthana we have developed enmity with the demons
these demons wander about tormenting others and spreading rumours of all kinds you need not worry about them
addressed thus by lakshmana sita got mighty angry her eyes turned red and she spoke harshly to truthful lakshmana
o ignoble cruel lakshmana you are a disgrace to your family i think this great disaster of rama is a pleasure to you
o lakshmanado you speak such words seeing the disaster of rama no wonder that cruel men who always move like you in disguise will thus resort to sinful action against rivals
you are very wicked you are hiding your true identity and employed by bharata you are following rama in the forest as he is alone
o lakshmana such intention of yours or even of bharatas will not be fulfilled i have held the hands of rama who has eyes like the lotus petal who has the complexion of the blue lotus how can i prefer some other man
i will undoubtedly give up my life in your presencei will not live even for a moment on earth without rama o son of sumitra
the selfcontrolled lakshmana with folded palms replied to sitas harsh horripilating words
o princess from mithila i do not want to use such harsh words to me you are a deity worthy of adoration it is not surprising that women of the world use such undeserving words it is their nature
women devoid dharma are fickle and inconsistent they use sharp piercing words o daughter of janaka o princess from videha your words pierce my ears like redhot dartsi cannot tolerate them
i speak what is just while you use harsh and unjust words let all beings who move in the forest bear witness
fie upon you like a woman of wicked nature you doubt me when i stood firm by my brothers words you will go to ruin
o beautiful lady i will go to rama wherever he may be be happy o largeeyed one may all the deities of the forest protect you
o daughter of janaka o princess from videha i see dreadful omens i do not know whether i will see you when i am back with rama
at these words of lakshmana sita started crying with eyes filled with tears she replied with harshness
o lakshmana without rama i will drown myself in godavari or hang myself or leap from a cliff into death
i will drink deadly poison or enter fire and die but will not touch any other man even with my feet
thus sita cried in distress sadly hitting her belly with both the hands blaming lakshmana all the time
saumitri saw the largeeyed dejected sita crying in distresshe pacified and consoled her but she did not say anything at all to her husbands brother
lakshmana brother of rama hurt by the harsh words of sita hastened with ramas wellbeing in mind
the tenheaded ravana who was in hiding assumed the guise of a wandering mendicant and approached sita
and then ravana wearing fine orange robes with hair knotted on the head carrying a parasol wearing sandals hanging a kamandalu waterpot and a staff on the auspicious left shoulder walked towards vaidehi like a mendicant
mighty ravana approached sita deprived of both the brothers like darkness encompasses the evening twilight in the absence of the sun and the moon
the extremely cruel ravana saw the illustrious young wife of rama just as ketu looks at rohini star in the absence of the moon
seeing the ferocious ravana the huge trees at janasthana shook vidently even the wind ceased to blow
seeing ravana with his bloodred eyes the swiftflowing river godavari slowed down out of fear
the tenheaded ravana who was waiting for ramas absence now got it disguised as a mendicant he stepped toward to where sita was
the evilminded ravana in the guise of a holy man like saturn moves towards chitra star came close to sita who was brooding over her husband
just like a well is concealed by an overgrowth of grass ravana guised as a holy man stood looking at illustrious sita the wife of rama
the wicked demon came close to that auspicious princess from videha sitting in the cottage her face was like the full moon her teeth and lips were lovely she was clad in yellow silk her eyes were like lotus petals tormented by tears of grief
sita was the most lovely lady of the world shining in beauty she was like the goddess of wealth laxmi without her lotus ravana praised her thus
who are you with a golden complexion clad in yellow silk and looking like a lotuspond and wearing an auspicious lotus garland
o lady with a beautiful face with lovely thighs are you hri shyness personified are you the auspicious lovely lakshmi the goddess of wealth are you the goddess of fame are you an apsara are you bhuti the goddess of fortune or are you rati the goddess of love moving at your free will
your teeth are even and pointed white and beautifulyour eyes are large and clear and sparkling with dark pupils with a red tinge at the corner
your big hips are stout and strong your smooth thighs are like the trunk of an elephant your breasts adorned with gems are round and robust like palm fruits and drooping with heaviness with projected stiff nipples shining and delightful adding beauty
o lady with an elegant smile beautiful teeth lovely eyes you are enticingyour slender waist can be compassed by my fistyour hair is beautiful and your large breasts are rubbing against each otheryou are capturing my mind just as the flow of water in a river touches its banks
o beautiful lady i have not seen such a beauty earlier either among goddesses or among gandharavis or yakshis or even among kinneris
you are the most beautiful among women in the world with all your tenderness and youth you are living in this forlorn forest this maddens my heart
you deserve to stroll in the terraces of palaces in beautiful luxurious and fragrant city gardens
o beautiful blackeyed lady i think you deserve the best of garlands best of food and clothes and a suitable husband
o best of women o lady with beautiful buttocks can you be one of the rudras or maruts or vasus to me you appear like a goddess
neither gandharvas nor kinnaras nor gods move here this is only a dwelling place for the demons how did you come here
there are monkeys lions panthers tigers hyenas bears kanka birds and other wild animals here how is it that you are not afraid of them
o charming lady how is it that although alone you are not afraid of the dreadful swift powerful wild animals like elephants in rut
who are you o auspicious lady who are your people why are you here from where have you come for what reason are you going about alone in this fierce dandaka tract inhabited by demons
seeing ravana a villain in the guise of a brahmin praising her sita the princess of videha honoured him with all hospitality
she offered the handsome guest a seat first and then water for washing his feet with and then invited him for food
sita being a lady was unable to doubt him since he came in the guise of a brahmin holding a bottlegourd and a begging bowl without knowing his illintention she invited him in mistaking him for a brahmin
o brahmin here is the seat for you feel free to sit here is water to wash your feet with this is the best of food for you collected from the forest please partake this without hesitation
ravana was observing the princess from mithila wife of a king inviting him and speaking to him in cordial manner looking at her he resolved to abduct her forcibly inviting his own death
sita looked out for the beautiful figure of rama who had gone to hunt the deer along with lakshmana waiting eagerly for her husband she only saw the vast stretch of green forest but not rama and lakshmana     thus ends the fortysixth sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
then ravana in the guise of a mendicant with crooked intention to abduct her asked vaidehi to tell him about herself
he is a brahmin and also a guest if unanswered he may curse me thinking this sita thought for a moment and said
o best of brahmins be pleased to know i am sita by name daughter of the great janaka king of mithila and wife of rama
i lived in the house of the ikshvakus for twelve years and enjoyed all kinds of pleasures meant for mortals
in the thirteenth year the king and lord dasaratha consulted other kings and ministers to consecrate rama
arrangements for consecration were on when queen kaikeyi sought a boon from the king
for the fulfilment of the promise made to kaikeyi earlier by my truthful fatherin law who to my good luck was the best of kings she asked for two boons one was banishment of my husband and second consecration of bharata
i shall not eat or sleep or even drink if rama is consecrated and i shall put an end to my life itself said kaikeyi
the king my fatherinlaw who respected her offered riches which she did not accept
my husband who was very bold was twentyfive years and i had completed eighteen years since my birth
my husband known in the world as rama is largeeyed longarmed virtuous truthful pure and is always engaged in the welfare of all beings
the brilliant king dasaratha father of rama overcome by passion did not consecrate rama in order to please kaikeyi
when my husband rama approached his father for the consecration she said these unhesitating words
o rama listen your father has ordered that this kingdom be bestowed on bharata without any obstacles
o rama of the kakutstha dynasty you should live in the forest for fourteen years and save your father from falsehood
my husband rama a man of fearlessness and firm resolution said to kaikeyi be it so and carried out her words
o brahmin this is his firm resolve and his great vow one should give and never take one should speak the truth and nothing but he truth
son to the second mother of rama his mighty halfbrother by name lakshmana a tiger among men and a slayer of enemies in battle is a companion to him
lakshmana his brother is righteous and steadfast bow in hand he followed rama along with me into exile
rama who is ever righteous and selfcontrolled entered the dandaka forest with matted locks his brother and me
o best of brahmins three of us have been wandering with courage in the deep forest dislodged from the kingdom on account of kaikeyi
rest here awhile my husband will return with plenty of meat of many kinds from the forest killing deer alligators and wild boars
o brahmin tell me your name your gotra and your pedigree and the purpose for which you are going about all alone in this dandaka forest
to these words of sita ramas wife ravana the powerful king of demons replied sharp
o sita i am called ravana the lord of demons by whom all the worlds of demons snakes and gods are frightened
o flawless beauty of golden complexion seeing you clad in silk i am not inclined to show any interest in my own wives
you will be the chief queen among the best of women i have won in wars be blessed
my great city called lanka is on the peak of a mountain surrounded by and in the middle of the sea
o sita you can stroll with me in my pleasuregardens o beautiful lady you will not like living in the forest thereafter
o sita if you become my wife five thousand female attendants adorned with all ornaments will attend on you
thus addressed by ravana janaki a lady of blemishless limbs got enraged and replied without caring for the demon
i am devoted to rama my husband who is unshakeable like a huge mountain is comparable to lord indra and is imperturbable like the mighty ocean
i am the loyal wife of venerable rama who is endowed with all excellences a refuge to all like a spreading banyan tree and a votary of truth
i am the faithful wife of the longarmed broadchested rama a lion among men his gait is the gait of an advancing invincible lion
i am the devoted wife of great rama whose face is like a fullmoon who is the son of a king who has conquered his senses and whose fame is widespread on earth
you are a jackal and you want a lioness like me who is difficult to win i am like the suns radiance whom you cannot even touch
o luckless ravana you want the beloved wife of ramayou will for sure see golden trees which those close to death do
you are seeking to pull the teeth from the mouth of a hungry and powerful lion who is considered the enemy of the deerwhich you are you intend to pull the fang of a poisonous snake
you are trying to carry the greatest of mountains the mandara with one hand you are wishing to go safe after drinking deadly poison produced from the churning of the ocean
you wish to violate the loving wife of rama you are rubbing your eyes with a needle and licking the razor with your tongue
you want to assault ramas dear wife it is like girding a stone round the neck and trying to cross the seait is like intending to take the sun and the moon with both your hands
you intend to assaut the wife of rama who is a lady of virtuous conduct you wish to hold blazing fire in your cloth
you want to acquire ramas worthy wife you wish to walk on sharp ironheaded spear
the difference between you and rama is the difference between a jackal and a lion in the forest between a ditch and the sea and between sour gruel and the best of wines
the difference between you and rama is the difference between gold and lead sandal and slime an elephant and a cat of the forest
the difference between you and dasarathas son is the difference between a crow and garuda a watercrane and a peacock a vulture and a swan in the forest
so long rama equal in prowess to the thousandeyed indra stands with bow and arrows in hand i will not although abducted wither away like a diamond gulped by an insect fly
having said thus to the wicked nightwalker ravana sita pure in thought remained distressedher slender body started trembling like a banana plant becomes shaken by a violent wind
beholding sita who was trembling ravana powerful like death started telling about himself his clan his strength and his deeds to instil more fear in her     thus ends the fortyseventh sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
addressed thus by sita ravana his anger roused knitted his eyebrows with a frown on his forehead and replied to her harshly
o paragon of beauty i am the halfbrother of kubera born of his stepmother i am known as the tenheaded powerful ravana be blessed
just as people get scared of death all creatures including gandharvas gods evil spirits birds and snakes run away from me
for some reason or other a duel took place between me and king kubera with my prowess i defeated him in the duel
out of fear for me kubera is residing on the mighty mount kailasa leaving his own earlier prosperous place of residence
o noble lady with my valour i gained over from kubera the aerial chariot pushpaka which can go wherever one desires and in which i move about in the sky
o princess from mithila seeing my angry face even gods led by indra take to their heels in fear
wherever i am the windgod blows with hesitation so are the sun and the moon afraid of me afraid of me the sun duly discharges his duties
wherever i stay or move about the leaves of trees do not shake and the waters in rivers remain still
my city known as lanka teeming with terrific demons is on the other side of the sea it is beautiful like the city of indras amaravati
the beautiful city of lanka shines with its pale white ramparts and golden interiors the entrance gates are encrusted with vaidurya catseye
it is crowded with elephants horses and chariots it resounds with the music of trumpets the trees in the delightful pleasuregardens yield fruits in all seasons
o highminded princess o sita while living with me you will not even think of other women
o blessed lady of fine complexion while enjoying both human and heavenly pleasures with me there you will not remember rama who is a mortal of short lifespan
considering the eldest son a weakling king dasaratha has sent him away to the forest so that he could consecrate his dear sonbharata
o largeeyed sita dislodged from the kingdom rama has lost his capacity to think he is doing penance assuming an ascetic role what can he do for you
i am lord of all the demons you should not reject me i am here only because i am overcome by the arrows of the god of love
o timid lady if you reject me you will regret like urvasi who kicked pururava and regretted later
o lady of fine complexion rama is a mere mortal in war he is no match even for my finger it is your good fortune that you have got me here take refuge in me
thus addressed sita was enraged and her eyes turned red she replied in harsh words to the chief of the demons in that solitary place
why do you wish to do something inauspicious by calling lord kubera who is worshipped by all beings your brother
o ravana you are cruel and evilminded you have no control over your senses and yet you are the ruler of your breed surely they are going to be destroyed
it may be possible for some one to live after abducting indras wife sachi but it is not possible for any one to live after kidnapping the wife of rama
o demon you may live long after forcibly snatching the most beautiful sachi from the hands of indra the wielder of the thunderbolt but after abusing a woman like me you will not be released from death even if you drink nectar     thus ends the fortyeighty sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
on hearing the sitas words the powerful ravana struck his palms one over the other and assumed a huge form original figure
ravana again said to that princess from mithila i suppose you are too insane to disregard my strength and valour
standing in the sky i can lift the earth with my arms i can drink the oceans i can kill even the god of death in a combat
i can obstruct the sun and shatter the earth with my sharp arrows o mad woman i am a husband who can fulfil your desires and can assume any form at my own free will look at me
as ravana exploded in anger his ambercoloured eyes turned red like the radiance of the flaming fire and almost as bright as the sun
ravana brother of kubera shed the gentle figure of a mendicant and assumed the form of the god of death
overcome by intense anger ravanas eyes reddened the nightranger stood armed with bow and arrows and shining with glittering gold ornaments appeared like a black cloud
ravana chief of the demons shed the mendicants form and assumed his real self clad in red garments his eyes turned red in anger looking like layers of clouds he stood in front of sita a gem among women
ravana said to the princess from mithila whose black hair was shining who was luminous like the sun and was clad in the best of cothes and ornaments
o beautiful lady if you desire a husband who is famous in the three worlds take refuge in me i am fit to be your husband
i am your praiseworthy husband i will not cause any unpleasantness to you at any time abandon on your inclination towards a mere mortal divert your love to me
o stupid woman you think you are very wise what is there in rama so that you are attached to him he has left the kingdom and his kith and kin due to the words of a woman he has not accomplished anything in life he has a limited life span and now lives in this forest haunted by wild animals
just as budha planet mercury catches rohini a cluster of five stars in the sky the evilminded infatuated ravana advanced towards the pitiable pleasing sita and caught hold of her
ravana seized with his left hand the lotuseyed sita by the hair and lifted her by the thighs with his right hand
the sylvan deities fled out of fear on seeing the dreadful appearance of ravana who had sharp teeth and mighty arms he looked like a mountain a veritable god of death
there arrived the great golden chariot of ravana illusive and wonderful harnessed with donkeys and braying like donkeys
reproaching the princess from videha loudly and harshly ravana took her on his lap and put her on the chariot
seized by ravana illustrious sita screamed aloud alas rama for one who was far away in the forest
passionate ravana took hold of sita who was not willing and was writhing in pain he seized her like an eagle carrying away a serpent queen and flew up
while sita was being carried off in the sky by the king of demons she screamed a lot in agony and anxiety like a mad woman in a bewildered state
alas o longarmed lakshmana you who used to entertain your brother do not know that i am being carried away by this ruthless demon
o rama you have given up your life pleasure and treasure for the sake of righteousness do you not see me carried off by an unrighteous fellow
o scorcher of enemies you are the chastiser of the haughty why do you not punish such a sinner like ravana
the effect of arrogant action cannot be seen right away just as the crop yields results only after ripening in the same way it takes time time acts as a supporting factor
time has taken a toll of your senses this has made you do what you have done a great calamity is awaiting you in the hands of rama it will end your life
alas the lawful wife of the glorious and righteous rama is being abducted now let kaikeyi along with her relations be happy with her desire fulfilled
o karnikar trees in full bloom in janasthana tell rama quickly that ravana is kidnapping sita
i salute to malyavan and prasravana mountains tell rama at once that ravana is carrying away sita
o river godavari abounding in swans and cranes my salutations to you tell rama immediately that ravana is taking away sita
i offer my salutations to different deities residing in this forest abounding in trees of many kinds tell my husband about me that i am being whisked away
i seek refuge in all those living beings as well as herds of animals and birds in the forest
tell rama that his dear wife sita whom he loves more than his life is abducted helplessly
if he knows that i am abducted by yama the god of death that mighty longarmed hero will save me even from there by virtue of his valour
when the griefstricken largeeyed sita was lamenting piteously she saw the vulture jatayu seated on a tree
the heavyhipped sita felt frightened in the grip of ravana when she saw jatayu she screamed shaken by sorrow
o jatayu see me now being carried away by the sinful king of demons in this pitiable condition as though i am an orphan
this nightranger is equipped with weapons cruel strong and evilminded he has won wars you cannot stop him
o jatayu narrate to rama and lakshmana the exact facts of my abduction and all the details without any omission     thus ends the fortyninth sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
while reposing jatayu heard the cry and at once looked up and saw ravana and vaidehi
glorious jatayu the best among the birds looked like the peak of a mountainhis beak was sharp his words were auspious he spoke from the top of the tree
o tenheaded ravana i am jatayu king of vultures i am mighty an eternal follower of dharma i am an adherent to truth
rama dasarathas son is the king of the entire world he is equal to indra and varuna he is ever engaged in the welfare of the entire world
the lady you want to abduct from here is the famous sita the lawful wife of rama the lord of the world
how can a king who adheres to righteousness outrage anothers wife o powerful one a kings wife in particular should be protected
refrain yourself from the vile thought of violating others wives wise men do not adopt what is censured by others just like ones own the wise should protect others wives
o son of paulastya learned men determine the path of dharma artha and kama following a kings conduct even if they are not declared in sastras
a king is the best repository of rigteousness material wealth and pleasures the king is the root of dharma virtue and sin
o best of demons by nature you are sinful and fickleminded you do all forbidden acts otherwisehow could you get this wealth like the celestial chariot
indeed it is not possible to erase the nature of any one whatever it be prosperity does not rest for long in the house of the evilminded
powerful and righteous rama has not offended you your kingdom or your city why do you offend him
on account of surpanakha khara trespassed into janasthana and got killed by rama without much effort tell me truly what transgression of dharma did he commit for which you are stealing away the wife of rama who is the lord of this world
leave vaidehi at once lest with her fierce looks you should be burnt down like demon vrtra by the thunderbolt of indra
you are not aware that you are tying a venomous snake with the skirt of your cloth worn by you you are not able to see the noose of death tightened around your neck
o gentle ravana one should carry that much of weight which does not tire him one should eat only that wholesome food which can be easily digested
who will do such a deed which cannot beget dharma fame or glory in the world who will do such deeds that bring only exhaustion to the body
sixty thousand years ago i was born o ravana since then i have ruled justly my hereditary kingdom
i am old you are young wielding a bow and arrows with shield to protect and chariot to ride even then i will not let you go safe with vaidehi kidnapped
you cannot carry vaidehi by force within my very sight just as the everlasting revelations of the vedas cannot be robbed by mere logic of reason
o ravana if you are brave fight with me in a moment you will be killed like khara and lie down on the ground
clad in bark garments rama who has often slain demons in the past will soon kill you in war
what can i do o mean fellow the two princes have gone far awayyou will soon be destroyed out of fear for them there is no doubt
i will not let you take away the auspicious lotuseyed sita the dear consort of rama as long as i am alive
i should do this important work of those great souls rama and dasaratha even if it claims my life
o ten headed ravana stay stay for a while o demon as long as i am alive i will treat you with the hospitality of war you will be pulled down from this best of the chariots like a ripe fruit drops from the stalk     thus ends the fiftieth sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
ravanas twenty eyes glowed like fire in anger after jatayu thus rightly said
as the bright gold earrings of the intolerant king of demons glittered his eyes turned red in rage and he pounced upon jatayu the lord of birds
the clash between them was tumultuous and it appeared like the clash of two pieces of clouds in the sky raised by stormy winds
the duel between ravana and jatayu looked as though it was a fight between two huge winged mountains of malyavan range
then the mighty ravana rained sharp dreadful shafts spears and vikarnis at jatayu king of vultures
jatayu lord of the birds faced the arrows and other weapons showered by ravana
the mighty virtuous vulture with his sharp claws wounded many parts of the body of ravana
ravana in a rage took ten dreadful darts looking like the staff of death with a desire to crush the enemy
the mighty ravana fully released his dreadful sharp arrows that went straight and pierced the vulture
seeing sita daughter of janaka on the demons chariot with eyes full of tears jatayu without minding the arrows renewed his attack
the glorious lord of birds crushed with his feet the bow and arrow of ravana with pearls and gems encrusted
overcome with anger ravana took another bow and rained on him hundreds and thousands of arrows
jatayu shot with arrows on all sides in the combat shone like the bird that returned to its nest
powerful jatayu scattered the shower of arrows with his wings and broke down the great bow with his claws
mighty jatayu lord of the birds shattered with his wings the armour of ravana that was glowing like fire
powerful jatayu killed in the combat the splendid swiftmoving devilfaced asses with golden shields yoked to the chariot
then hejatayu broke down the great chariotof ravana glowing like fire glittering with gold and gems made of three bamboo reeds and capable of flying wherever the rider willed
jatayu violently pulled down the parasol shining like the full moon and the fans of the chariot along with the demons holding them
again the glorious powerful king of birds swiftly shattered the huge head of the charioteer with his beak
with the bow broken the chariot destroyed asses drawing the chariot and the charioteer dead ravana fell down on the ground holding vaidehi on his lap
seeing ravana fallen on the ground with his broken chariot all beings honoured the king of the birds saying well done well done
seeing the lord of the flocks of birds exhausted due to age still fighting ravana felt glad he flew back into the sky taking sita princess of mithila with him
seeing sita janakas daughter happily carried away into the sky by ravana on his lap jatayu the mighty king of vultures chased him and obstructing his path said
foolish ravana you are kidnapping this lady wife of rama whose arrows can hit like a thunderbolt this will lead to the destruction of all demons
you are drinking poison along with all your friends relatives ministers the army and your allies like a thirsty man drinks water
fools who do not know the consequences of their action perish soon similarly you are going to die soon
you are bound by the noose of death like a fish holding on to the bait of the fishing hook where can you go now
o ravana know that rama and lakshmana the kakutsthas are invincible they will not forgive the asssault you have made on their hermitage
your cowardly action will be condemned by the whole world the path you have chosen is the path of a thief and not of a hero
o ravana if you are courageous tarry awhile and fight with me like your brother khara you will lie on the ground dead
you have resorted to unrighteous action like a dying man this will spell your destruction
if the consequences of an action be sin who will do it even the selfborn lord of the world may not
brave jatayu having thus said these cautious words to the demon dashed against his back again and again
thereafter seizing ravana jatayu ascended on his back and pierced his body all over with his sharp claws just as a rider goads an unruly elephant
jatayu who had his claws wings and beak as the only weapons pierced and pricked ravana all over with his nails by pressing his beak on his back and pulled out his hair
thus tormented again and again by the king of vultures ravana shook with anger his lips quivering
losing his senses with rage ravana held vaidehi sita with his left arm and hit jatayu with his palm
then jatayu lord of the birds subduer of enemies overpowered ravana and dismembered his ten left arms with his beak
as the left arms were cut off there came out from them all the ten arms instantaneously like serpents emitting poisonous flames from anthills
then the tenheaded ravana left sita and attacked jatayu with his fists and feet out of anger
between the warriors of unequal valour ravana and jatayu the chief of the demons and the foremost of the birds the fight took place for a moment
ravana lifted his sword and cut off both the wings and feet of jatayu who was fighting relentlessly for ramas sake
seriously wounded and almost deadthe vulture fell down on the ground all at once when his wings were chipped by the demon of terrible deeds
sita princess of videha saw the wounded jatayu fallen on the ground drenched in blood grieving she ran towards him as if he was her relative
lord of lanka saw that very bold jatayu of dark blue colour of the cloud fair chest fallen on the ground looking like the forest fire that had been put out
sita daughter of janaka whose face was radiant like the moon once again embraced jatayu the winged warrior fallen on the ground crushed by ravanas onslaught and wept     thus ends the fiftyfirst sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
sitawhose face was like the lord of the stars moon saw jatayu king of birds struck down by ravana and lamented in extreme grif
people for sure foresee weal and woe in life from auspicious symptoms and ominous sounds
o rama you are indeed unaware of the great disaster that has befallen you all the animals and birds are running for my sake to tell you about me o scion of the kakutsthas
this bird that came forward to save me is hit by the sinnerravana and lies down on the ground as ill luck would have it
terribly frightened the beautiful lady sita cried bitterly o rama o lakshmana save me as if they were close by and were listening to her
ravana king of the demons ran towards sita who was weeping like an orphan with her garlands and ornaments crushed
separated from rama in the forest sita hugged huge trees running round and round like a creeper coiled crying loudly rama o rama the king of the demons like yama caught hold of her hair only to invite his death all the time saying leave it leave it leave the tree
while sita was being assaulted the earth with the animate and the inanimate crossed all limits of moral law and became enveloped in blinding darkness the wind ceased to blow and the sun to shine
brahma the glorious grandfather saw with his divine eyes sita in a desperate state caught by the enemy and said the task is accomplished
all the great seers residing in dandaka forest felt both happy and sad happy because the destruction of ravana is at hand and sad because sita was in distress
while sita was crying o rama o lakshmana ravana lord of the demons carried her back into the sky
sita who had put on pure gold ornaments on her body and who was clad in yellow silk shone like lightning
ravana was shining all the more withher yellow clothes blowing in the air and looked like a mountain shining with fire burning around
the red lotus petals worn by the most auspicious sita princess of videha were showered on ravana
as the goldencoloured garment worn by sita blew in the wind it looked like a coppercoloured cloud illumined by the evening sun in the sky
sitas face with her beautiful nose on ravanas lap and not on ramas shone no more like a lotus without its stalk
sitas face looked beautiful with her smooth forehead shining hair and spotless complexion like the inside of a lotus with clean white shining teeth a nice nose and lovely red lips she was continuously weeping and wiping her tears her face which was pleasing like the moon on the lap of ravana appeared as though the moon was rising through dark clouds
shaken up by the demon and deprived of ramas company sitas beautiful face looked like the moon during daytime without any glow
goldencomplexioned sita princess of mithila held by the darkcoloured king of the demons shone like a girdle resting on a dark blue sapphire
bright like a golden lotus adorned with gold ornaments sita the daughter of janaka held by ravana looked like a streak of lightning shining bright in a dark cloud
the lord of the demons by the side of sita princess of videha with her jingling ornaments looked like the darkblue raincloud with its lightning and thunder
as sita was being carried away the shower of flowers dropped from her head and scattered on the earth
the shower of flowers that fell flew towards the tenheaded ravana again in the swirling motion of the chariot
the shower of flowers that dropped went round towards ravana brother of vaisravana like the bright garland of stars move towards mount meru
the gemstudded anklet of sita looking like an orb of lightning dropped with a gentle sound
with her golden girdle sita whose complexion resembled tender leaves looked like a golden chain to bind an elephant with here ravana is the elephant
the younger brother of vaisravana ravana like a massive comet carried sita who was glowing in the radiance of her own beauty and entered the sky
like the dim stars falling from the sky her ornaments bright as flame scattered on the groundtinkling
sitas necklace shining like the bright moon slipped from between her breasts like the river ganga falling down from the sky
the trees filled with birds of all kinds shaken at the top by stormy winds seemed to be saying to sita be not afraid
lotusponds with withering lotuses and with disturbed aquatic life like fishes in fright were as if grieving for sita as one would grieve for a companion who is unable to breathe
then the lions tigers deer and birds gathered together in anger also anguish and ran after sitas shadow
the mountains were shedding tears in the form of waterfalls and crying with hands lifted up in the form of peaks while sita was being carried away
seeing sita abducted the glorious sun looked lustreless and distraught he developed a pale white disk around him
when ramas consort the princess of videha is being carried away by ravana how can there be rightousness or truth or uprightness or compassion for men thus bewailed all beings in groups
the young deer full of fear and distress looked again and again with eyes blurred with tears at the direction in which sita went and wept
the sylvan deities shivered seeing sitas grief and cried aloud
the ten headed ravana abducted sita who was calling out o rama o lakshmana with her sweet voice weeping looking down on the earth her hair dishevelled and auspicious vermilion mark on the forehead erased ravana abducted this highminded sita for his own destruction
then sita whose teeth were beautiful and smile sweet was distanced from her kins and unable to see both rama and lakshmana grew pale in intense fear     thus ends the fiftysecond sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
sita daughter of janaka princess of mithila felt miserable looking at ravana taking off and got very much agitated out of fear
while being carried away sita wept piteously and her eyes went red with tears of anger and grief looking at the frightening eyes of the king of the demons she said these words
o mean ravana are you not ashamed of kidnapping me when i was separated from my husband
o wicked fellow with an intention to abduct me you enticed my husband to a distance deceitfully in the form of a deer
this jatayu an old friend of my fatherinlaw tried to protect me but he too has fallen a prey
o lowly demon you have indeed shown your heroism in killing this old vulture you have not won me in a battle declared by you
o lowly fellow how is it that you are not ashamed of commiting such a despicable act abducting anothers wife when she is alone
you consider yourself to be brave after committing such a cruel despicable and unrighteous act for which people of the world will condemn you
fie upon your heroism and strength about which you boasted fie upon your character that would bring calumny to the race and the world i condemn such behaviour of yours
tarry a little you will not go back with life what can be done now since you are running away so swiftly
if you come within sight of these two princes it will not be possible for you to live for a moment even if you are with your entire army
just as a bird cannot bear the touch of forest fire you will not be able to endure the mere touch of arrows of the two heroes indeed
o ravana be good and do whatever is beneficial to you it is proper for you to release me if you do not enraged over my assault my husband along with his brother will bring about your destruction
o vile creature the effort you are making to abduct me forcibly will be fruitless
i will not be eager to hold on to my life for long to live at the mercy of the enemy without being able to see my godlike husband
at the time of death mortals behave very differently they act contrary to their own welfare likewise you are not able to foresee what is beneficial and good for you
those who wish to die do not like anything salutary i see the noose of death wound round your neck now
o tenheaded ravana since you do not fear the source of fear evidently you see golden trees a symptom of death
o ravana you see the dreadful river vaitarani with torrents of blood flowing and frightening forest of trees with swords as leaves
you will see a log of salmali tree with bright golden flowers and excellent vaidurya stone with pointed iron thorns
you are pitiless you will not be able to survive for long after deceiving such noble rama just as man cannot survive after drinking poison
o ravana you are bound by the inevitable noose of death where shall you get away from great rama my husband to obtain peace
rama has killed fourteen thousand demons alone without his brother within a moment he is a strong warrior and wellversed in the use of all kinds of weapons you have stolen his loving wife how can he live without killing you
sita daughter of videha full of sorrow and fear under ravanas grip uttered these partly harsh and partly piteous wordsweeping
sinful ravana carried away the beautiful princess trembling with great fear struggling helplessly crying pathetically and pleading in many mournful ways     thus ends the fiftythird sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
while sita was being kidnapped she saw no one to protect her only five great monkeys stood on the top of a mountain
largeeyed bright and beautiful sita dropped her upper silk garment shining like gold and auspicious ornaments in their midst with a hope they may report this to rama
in his excitement ravana failed to notice when sita dropped down that garment along with ornaments in their midst
the best among the tawneyeyed monkeys gazed without blinking at the largeeyed sita lamenting
ravana crossed the lake pampa and flew towards the city of lanka carrying with him lamenting daughter of videha
delighted ravana carried off sita the very embodiment of his death like one carrying a highly poisonous sharpfanged female snake on his lap
like an arrow released from the bow ravana went through the sky at once crossing forests rivers mountains and tanks
ravana soon crossed the refuge of rivers the abode of varuna god of the sea inexhaustible ocean and the home for whales and crocodiles
while sita princess of videha was being carried away the ocean abode of varuna got bewildered waves rolled back the movement of big serpents and fishes stopped
the charanas and siddhas moving in the sky said o tenheaded ravana this is your end
ravana entered the city of lanka holding sita who was tossing from side to side and who was the very embodiment of his death
ravana went through the well laidout roads of the city of lanka and through the well many guarded halls of the palace and entered the inner apartment
sita with her dark eye lashes and lost in utter sorrow was kept in the harem by ravana like demon maya kept mayamayi
ravana ordered the female goblins of fearful appearancelet no outsider whether man or woman see her without my permission
pearls gems or gold clothes or ornaments whatever she desires be made available to her without any hesitation
whoever utters any unpleasant words knowingly or unknowingly to sita princess of videha is not worthy to survive must be killed
the courageous lord of the demons having said so to the demonesses came out of the inner apartment while contemplating the future course of action he saw eight powerful carnivorous demons
the mighty ravana deluded by the boons praised the strength and valour of the demons and said
armed with different weapons proceed at once to janasthana where khara lived and died
go and there in the desolate janasthana where all demons had been killed leaving all your apprehensions and relying on your strength and vigour
i had stationed a great army at janasthana who were all killed along with khara and dusana by ramas arrows
my anger engineered by my intolerance has crossed the limits of my patience it has created in me a terrific enmity against rama
i want to take revenge on my foe i shall not sleep until i kill him in a combat
i will be happy only after killing the destroyer of khara and dusana just as a poor man feels happy only on acquiring wealth
while dwelling at janasthana all of you should collect exact information about the activities of rama
all of you o nightrangers should be on the alert there and it should be always your duty to try to kill rama
i have seen your strength on many war fronts that is why you have been assigned this duty at janasthana
the eight demons were glad to hear the pleasing and meaningful words of ravana they offered him salutations and left lanka in the direction of janasthana without being seen by any one
then the demon ravana felt greatly happy for getting sita princess of mithila without knowing in his delusion that he had created the bitterest enmity with rama     thus ends the fiftyfourth sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
after ordering the eight most fierce and powerful demons ravana had a sense of accomplishment within himself because of his perverse intellect
thinking about vaidehi and hit by the arrows of cupid the god of love ravana hastened to see sita and entered the beautiful home
ravana lord of the demons entered his residence and saw sita full of grief in the midst of the demonesses
the demon ravana forcibly took sita her face full of tears to show her his heavenlike home inflicted with grief she looked wretched she resembled a female deer hounded out of the herd with her head bent in grief she looked pathetic like one not under her control like a boat sinking under the sea driven by the wind
his home was a complex of palaces and mansions served by thousands of women it was an abode of different flocks of birds it had captivating pillars studded with gold crystals silver diamonds and vaiduryas it resounded with wonderful sounds of drums its golden entrances were glittering
he ascended the wonderful golden staircase taking sita along with himbeautiful looked the rows of mansions with silver and ivory windows and golden trellis
the tenheaded ravana showed sita the princess from mithila the floors with wonderful crystals
ravana showed sita who was overwhelmed with sorrow stepwells surrrounded by various trees and tanks
the sinful ravana showed sita princess of videha the best of all his mansions in order to allure her saying
o sita leaving aside children and the aged i am the lord of crores of nightrangers in addition to ten crore demons and twentytwo crore terrorists
for me alone there are a thousand attendantsthe administration of the kingdom and all my subjects will be under your control o largeeyed sita you are dearer to me than my life
o sita dear be my chief queen among the many thousands of women i have married
do not think otherwise be good and accept my request i am consumed by thoughts of you you should be gracious to me
this lanka extending to a hundred yojanas and surrounded by the sea is vulnerable to neither demons nor gods including indra
i do not see any one equal to me in valour among gods or yakshas or gandharvas or birds
of what use is rama who has lost his kingdom who is depressed and leads an ascetic life and who is a shortlived lacklustre human being
o sita take refuge only in me i am a befitting husband to you o timid one youth is impermanent enjoy your life with me while it lasts
o lovely sita give up the thought of seeing rama where does he possess the power to reach this place even on the mental plane
it is not possible to bind the wind blowing at high speed in the sky similarly it is not possible to catch the brilliant glow of flaming fire
o lovely lady i do not see any one in these three worlds who can by his valour take you away from me guarded by my arms
rule this vast kingdom of lanka people like me even gods and all beings mobile and immobile will be at your beck and call
drenched with the waters of consecration entertain me the effect of the bad deeds done in the past are over with your dwelling in the forest now enjoy the fruits of your good and righteous deeds here with me
o princess from mithila put on all garlands of wonderful fragrance and finest of jewels here with me
o finehipped lady i won by my strength from my brother vaisravana kubera an aerial chariot called pushpaka shining with the radiance of the sun
o sita that excellent chariot is big and beautiful where on you can roam happily along with me
o heavyhipped lady your face which is a clean lotus pleasing to the eye has lost its shine stricken with grief
as ravana went on speaking thus sita covered her beautiful moonlike face with the edge of her garment and stood shedding tears
while sita was lost in thought feeling ill at lase looking wretched with her beauty dulled by her anxiety the sinful lord of the demons continued
i am bowing down pressing my heads at your shining feet i am at your mercy grant me your favouri will remain your slave and remain ever under your control
my throat has dried up i have spoken these words in a forlorn state ravana has never bowed down to a woman in obeisance
having said this to the daughter of janaka the tenheaded ravana who had fallen under the control of yama lord of death misconceived that she had become his own     thus ends the fiftyfifth sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
thus addressed by ravana sita immersed in deep sorrow and unafraid of him placed a blade of grass between her and him intending not to speak to him straight and replied
rama is a son of the renowned king dasaratha who was a firm ambankment protector of righteousness and was true to his promise
the longarmed largeeyed rama is famous in all the three worlds he is my husband a righteous soul and a god to all
the brilliant rama of the ikshvaku dynasty with the lions shoulders will come with his brother lakshmana and take away your life
had you abducted me forcibly in his presence you would have been lying down dead just as khara in janasthana
those dreadful mighty demons you have described are ineffective in his presence just like the serpents who with their venom are ineffective in the presence of suparna garuda
the goldtipped arrows released from his bowstring will shatter your body like the waves erode the banks of river ganga
o ravana even if you stand invulnerable to gods and demons you will not come out alive in the combat with rama with whom you have earned great enmity
powerful rama will put an end to whatever little life you are left with just as a beast tied to a sacrificial post you will not survive
o demon you will be completely consumed if rama looks at you with eyes burning in anger
he who can bring down the moon to the earth from the sky or even dash it down he who can drain the sea dry will definitely release me from here
your life is coming to an end your fortunes will wane your strength will be sapped your senses will be dissipated by your deeds lanka will attain widowhood
this evil deedof abduction will not yield happy resultsyou have brought me from my husband from the forest without any forethought
my effulgent valiant husband armed with divine power resides fearlessly in the desolate dandaka
he will remove your pride your power your valour and haughtiness from your limbs with a shower of arrows in the fight
when destruction draws near people being prompted by time start commiting blunders in their deeds
you vilest of demons since you have assaulted me the time of your death and destruction of all demons and of all women in the harem has drawn near
the sacrificial altar adorned with ladles and vessels and sanctified by the sacred mantras recited by brahmins cannot be defiled by a chandala man of lowest caste
o lowly demon similarly i am a chaste woman and wife of the ever righteous rama who cannot be defiled by a sinner like you
how can a female swan ever sporting in lotusponds in the company of a royal swan look at the watercrow resting on a grassy land
o demon this body has now no consciousness you may bind it or bury it i do not think that this body or even this life need to be protected but at no cost can i make this an object of censure on earth must not be branded an unchaste woman
having uttered these very harsh words out of anger the daughter of videha the princess from mithila spoke no more
having heard such harsh horripilating words from sita ravana replied in a way designed to create fear in her
o comely princess from mithila o lady with a sweet smile listen to my words if you do not accept my hand in the course of twelve months the cooks will cut you off into small bits for the my breakfast
enraged ravana who used to make enemies wail turned to the demonesses and said these words
addressing the flesheating blooddrinking loathsome and fearful demonesses ravana said humble her pride at once
no sooner had ravana said it than the dreadful demonesses offered obeisance to him with folded hands and surrounded sita
stamping his feet and shaking the ground as if tearing the earth ravana said to those fiercelooking demonesses
let this sita be led into the asoka grove there sit round her and protect her in secret her presence there should not be made public
there you all bring her under control through forcing and cajoling as one would do to tame a wild sheelephant
thus instructed by ravana the demonesses took sita into the asoka grove which was full of perenmal fruits and flowers of different kinds where trees yielded fruits of all seasons and birds were always cheerful
sita daughter of janaka engulfed in grief found herself like a doe under the control of tigresses
sita daughter of janaka immersed in deep grief knew no peace just like a doe caught in a snare
sita had no peace as she was threatened excessively by those women of deformed looks remembering her beloved husband who was also her god and overtaken by fear and grief she fell unconscious     thus ends the fiftysixth sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
rama killed maricha the demon assuming the form of the deer as per his will and swiftly took the return path
while rama was hasting to see sita he heard from behind the ghastly howl of a jackal
rama knew it was the horrible horripilating cry of a jackal which made him apprehensive it made him think
the way the jackal is howling appears ominous may sita be safe without being eaten up by demons
if lakshmana listens to maricha imitating my voice in the form of a deer he sent by sita will come for me at once leaving her behind
hence the murder of sita must have been jointly planned by the demons maricha who had assumed the form of a golden deer took me away from the hermitage to a faroff place where killed by my arrows he turned a demon uttering the words alas lakshmana i am killed
on account of living in this dense forest in janasthana i have earned enmity with the demons will lakshmana and sita be safe without my protection i see many terrible portents
on hearing the jackals howl rama began thinking how the demon in the form of a deer drew him away thus in the midst of apprehensions he reached janasthana
dejected at heart the birds and animals piteously kept the great soul rama to the left and produced a dreadful cacophony
on seeing such dreadfu omens at that time rama hurried back to his hermitage
rama arrived at janasthana thinking of the safety of charming sita and mighty lakshmana
he then saw lakshmana coming towards him with a cheerless face when the sad depressed lakshmana came near he saw rama equally despondent and griefstricken
in this situation rama the elder brother rebuked lakshmana for having left sita behind in a desolate forest infested with demons
rama the delight of the raghus took hold of lakshmanas left hand and in sadness said these sweet harsh words
o gentle lakshmana you are to blame for coming here leaving sita behind alas will she be safe now
o heroic lakshmana i see many inauspicious omens i think sita might have been lost or eaten away by the demons of the forest there is no doubt about it
o lakshmana a tiger among men will we be able to see the daughter of janaka living in a state of total wellbeing will we be able to get her back
o mighty lakshmana from the way the beasts jackals and birds too have turned in the bright direction of the sun crying in a frightful manner can we hope princess sita is safe
appearing in the guise of a deer this demon allured me to a great distance with much effort he was somehow killed but he assumed his demoniac form while dying
with my heart dejected and depressed my left eye throbbing o lakshmana i have no doubt that sita is either abducted or dead or abandoned on the way     thus ends the fiftyseventh sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
rama son of dasaratha the righteous self saw lakshmana downcast and dejected seeing him without sita rama enquired
where is that princess from videha who accompanied me when i entered dandaka forest why have you come here leaving her behind
where is that princess from videha a sharer of my sorrows sita of slender waist who followed this hapless prince disloged from the kingdom into the dandaka forest
o warrior lakshmana where is that sita without whom i have no interest to live for a moment who was like the daughter of a god and a sustainer of my life
o lakshmana i desire no lordship of the gods or of the entire earth without that daughter of janaka that lady of golden complexion
o gentle lakshmana i wonder if vaidehi who is dearer to me than my life is still alive i hope my banishment from the kingdom is not going to prove false
o saumitri when i am dead on account of sita and you are back kaikeyi with her desire fulfilled will be happy indeed
o handsome one i wonder if that lady of renunciation kausalya with her son dead will have to serve kaikeyi whose desire would be fulfilled and who will enjoy the power of the throne in the company of her son
o lakshmana only if vaidehi is alive will i enter the cottage again or else i will give up my life if that virtuous lady is no more
i will die if sita princess from videha is not there to speak to me with her sweet smile when i return to the cottage o lakshmana
tell me o lakshmana if sita is alive or not whether she was eaten up by demons when you were off your guard
vaidehi is delicate young and she has never faced any sorrowshe will be certainly disheartened due to separation from me
the evilminded wicked demon calling out loudly o lakshmana must have by all means instilled fear in your mind
i am afraid vaidehi frightened by hearing the voice which was like mine sent you to see me and you came all at once
you have definitely done a great mistake by leaving sita alone in the forest this has given a chance to the cruel demons to wreak revenge
the dreadful carnivorous demons aggrieved over my murder of khara must have undoubtedly killed sita
o destroyer of enemies i am completely drowned in sorrow what can i do at this moment alas i am destined to suffer
while thus brooding over the beautiful sita the scion of the raghus along with lakshmana hurried towards janasthana
thus blaming his dejected brother the valiant rama entered the hermitage sighing deeply his face pale and his throat dried up with hunger exhaustion and thirst reaching his dwellingplace he found it empty he thoroughly searched the hermitage and the places where she used to move about on the premises and so it has happened he sadly said to himself his hair raised on end     thus ends the fiftyeighth sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
rama the delight of the raghus once again questioned lakshmana who had come out of the hermitage deeply hurt
why did you come leaving the princess from mithila alone in the forest when i had left her under your trust
when i saw you o lakshmana coming without sita my mind was oppressed with evil thought which have come true
o lakshmana as i saw you from a distance without sita my left eye my shoulder and my heart throbbed
thus addressed virtuous lakshmana overwhelmed with sorrow replied to the grief stricken rama
i did not leave her on my own nor have i come here of my own accord i came to you provoked by her angry words
uttered loudly alas sita alas lakshmana save me as if these were the words of your noble self reached sitas ears
the princess from mithila heard this cry of pain and wild with fear urged me out of her love for you to go
when i was repeated asked to go i said this in order to instil confidence in the princess from mithila
no one can cause fear in rama i do not see any demon who can hold a threat to him give up fear some one might have said it
how can rama who is capable of saving even gods speak such unworthy demeaning words save me o sita
o fair lady for some reason some demon has uttered these words save me save me adapting my brothers voice
lakshmana save me are the words uttered in an altered tone like an ordinary lowborn woman you are not to feel concerned for this
you should not feel agitated or dispirited be composed there is no one either born or going to be born in the three worlds who can defeat rama in war he cannot be conquered in a battle even by gods led by indra
deluded by her senses vaidehi said these words shedding tears when i tried to console her
you have an extremely sinful intention of getting me when your brother is dead but you will not be able to gain me
since you are not reaching out to rama who is helplessly crying for his rescue you must have followed rama instructed by bharata to do him harm
you are an enemy moving in disguise with an interest in me you are waiting for an opportunity to set aside rama that is why you are not rushing to him
at these words from the princess of videha i came out of the hermitage in an agitated mood with my eyes turned red and lips quivering in anger
to lakshmana thus reporting rama overcome with grief saideven then o noble brother your coming here leaving her behind is a wrong step taken
you have come out of the hermitage provoked by maithilis angry words even though you are aware that i am capable of warding off the demons
i am not happy with you as you have come here deserting sita on the plea that she was angry and spoke harsh words
provoked by the words of sita spoken in anger you came without respecting my orders it is definitely an act of disobedience
this demon who misled me in the guise of a deer and took me away from the hermitage lies dead killed by my arrow
bending the bow i fixed the arrow and released it at ease hit by that arrow he gave up his guise of the deer and assuming the form of a demon with a bracelet on his arm fell down groaning
hit by the arrow the demon imitating my voice cried out in desperation which could be clearly audible even from a distance on hearing the dreadful words you deserted sita and came here     thus ends the fiftyninth sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
as rama was returning to the hermitage his left eye throbbed repeatedly and he stumbled and his body trembled
as inauspicious omens appeared again and again doubting if all is well with sita he said to himself can sita be safe
anxious to see sita he hastened to the hermitage and finding it empty became restless
rama the delight of the raghu dynasty hurtled in turning round throwing his hands to and fro casting his looks all around the cottage where she used to move the cottage devoid of sita looked like a lotuspond the beauty of its lotuses destroyed by winter
the trees with flowers withered the animals and birds turned pale looked as if they were weeping bereft of their beauty they wore a ruinous look the sylvan deities had left the deerskin and kusa grass were strewn here and there the grass cushions and straw mats lay scattered seeing his cottage so desolate rama wept again and again
timid sita might have been abducted or dead or crushed or eaten up by demons or she may be hiding for protection in the forest
maybe she has gone to pluck flowers or fruits or to the lotuspond or river to fetch water
he ransacked the forest yet did not find his beloved he appeared like a mad man his eyes turned red with tears of sorrow
running from tree to tree hill to hill and river to river and weeping rama was immersed in a sea of sorrow
o kadamba tree tell me if you have seen my beloved with a fair face and with love for kadamba flowers
o bilva tree tell me if you have seen a lady delicate like your tender leaf dressed in yellow silk a lady whose breasts are round like bilva fruits
o arjuna tree tell me if you know a timid lady daughter of janaka and my beloved fond of arjuna tree is the living or not
this kakubha tree rich with tender leaves and flowers perhapsknows maithili whose thighs are beautiful like the trunk of the kakubha tree
this great tilaka tree round which bees bumble surely knows the lady who loves to put tilaka marks on the forehead
o ashoka tree dispeller of sorrow by quickly showing me my darling make me ashoka free from sorrow as i am griefstricken at heart
o palmyra tree be kind to me and tell me if you have seen my beautiful beloved who has breasts like ripe palmyra fruit
o jambu tree do not hesitate to tell me if you know sita whose body shines lovely like gold
o karnikara tree with flowers in full bloom tell me if you have seen my faithful beloved who is fond of karnikara flowers
renowned rama like a madman confused approached the mango kadamba sal and jackfruit dhava champak ketaki trees and pomegranate jasmine and madhavi creepers in order to make similar queries
or o deer do you know about maithili who has the eyes of a fawn my beloved who has the restless eyes of a doe may be found in their company
o elephant tell me if you have seen her whose thighs are like the trunk of an elephant o best of elephants tell me if you know her
o tiger tell me freely and fearlessly if you have seen my beloved princess from mithila with a face like the moon
o lotus eyed darling why are you running away i have already seen you why are you hiding behind trees and not replying to me
o my beautiful beloved stay stay have you no compassion for me you are so fond of fun why do you avoid me
o lady of lovely complexion i can see your yellow silk flying while you are running away if you have love for me stay on
o lady with a sweet smile i have never hurt you when i am in difficulty it does not behove you to ignore me
it is clear that separated from me the body of my young beloved is torn off and eaten away by carnivorous demons
her beautiful face with her sparkling teeth and lips wellshaped nose shining earrings has been like the full moon eclipsed and rendered pale
that delicate beautiful neck of my beloved having the complexion of a champak flower and adorned with necklaces was perhaps eaten up
her arms delicate like tender leaves their tips fingers quivering adorned with armlets and bracelets have surely been eaten away
the young lady having many relations forsaken by me has been perhaps picked up by a demon for food and later abandoned halfeaten
o longarmed lakshmana are you able to see my beloved anywhere o noble lady o darling where have you gone o sita sita
rama ran from forest to forest now jumping now taking strong strides but all the time weeping a madman busy in search of his beloved
he rushed through forests rivers hills and mountain streams and through dense jungles with an unstable mind
rama went about the vast forest searching for the princess from mithila all over not giving up hope of finding her he continued to make great efforts for searching his beloved     thus ends the sixtieth sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
rama son of dasaratha saw the empty cottage devoid of sita the mats were displaced he searched everywhere but unable to see vaidehi lifted his lovely arms and said
o son of sumitra where is my beloved where did she go by whom was she abducted or devoured o lakshmana
o sita if you intend to make fun by hiding behind a tree i tell you it is enough stop it and come to this extremely sorrowful man
o gentle sita those fawns who trusted you and played with you are now separated from you brooding over you their eyes are brimming with tears
o lakshmana i cannot live without sita i am filled with deep grief on account of sitas abduction my late father the king will certainly see me in the other world i will definitely commit suicide
my father say will surely in the other world without completing the appointed period of the vow taken how could you come here fie upon you you are irresponsible you are ignoble you are a liar
o lovely lady where have you gone leaving me here like fame deserting a crook i am helpless griefstricken pitiable pathetic and disappointed o lady of slender waist leave me not separated from you i will give up my life
deeply distressed rama who was anxious to see sita daughter of janaka wailed and wailed but could not see her
lakshmana dedicated to his wellbeing spoke to rama son of dasaratha who was sinking like an elephant into the quagmire when he failed to trace sita
o longarmed heroic rama do not grieve this forest is full of caves let us try together
sita is madly in love with the forest she might have entered deep into the jungle or into a fully blossomed lotuspond
maybe she has gone to take a dip in the river full of reeds and fishes or has hidden somewhere for the sake of fun
o best of men maybe vaidehi has hidden in the forest intending to scare you and me she wishes to test our love o blessed rama let us ransack the forest immediately
o scion of the kakutsthas let us search all over the forest if you please do not indulge in sorrow
when lakshmana consoled him so affectionately rama became composed he continued the search with lakshmana son of sumitra
the two sons of dasaratha went on searching for sita in forests mountains rivers ponds everywhere
they were not able to find sita even though they searched all over the mountain slopes caves and peaks
after searching her all over rama said saumitri i am unable to find the noble vaidehi on the mountain
going about the dandaka forest lakshmana consumed by sorrow said to his brother glowing with brilliance
o longarmed brother o wise sire just as visnu obtained the earth by binding bali you will obtain sita certainly
having been addressed thus by lakshmana raghava with a griefstriken heart said these piteous words lakshmanahaving spoken like that very affectionately to ramawho was disturbed by excessive grief said these words piteously
o wise lakshmana i have searched the entire forest the ponds with fully blossomed lotuses the mountains with many caves and streams but could not see vaidehi who is dearer to me than my life
thus tormented by the abduction of sita rama felt dejected and criedoverpowered by grief he lost his consciousness for a moment
by grief tormented limbs enervated intellect atrophied senses switched off he felt anxious and depressed and sighed long and hot
rama his throat choked shed propuse tears sighing o my darling
then lakshmana the knower of dharma and a dear friend offered obeisance most humbly with folded palms and consoled rama in many ways
without caring for the words from the lips of lakshmana rama sobbed loudly unable to see his beloved sita     thus ends the sixtyfirst sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
the righteous the longarmedlotuseyed rama unable to see sita wept with his senses overwhilmed by grief
under the spell of cupid rama uttered such words in grief which are otherwise unutterable as if he was seeing sita before him which was not a fact
o my beloved as you love flowers you are hiding your body behind the branches of the ashoke tree that enhances my sorrow paradoxically
o devi i can see both your thighs which resemble banana trunk hidden behind a banana plant it is not possible for you to hide them from me
o gentle one you are wandering in the karnikara garden laughing and making fun enough of this that causes my pain
o my dear sita why are you joking when i am exhausted such fun cannot be relished now
o darling joking specially in a hermitage is not appreciated i know your natureyou love fun o largeeyed sita come here this cottage of yours is empty
o lakshmana surely sita is either devoured by demons or abducted when i am weeping like this she is not coming to me
o lakshmana these herds of deer with their eyes filled with tears are as if telling me that she is eaten away by the demons
alas my noble lady where have you gone o chaste lady of excellent complexion that queen kaikeyis desire will be fulfilled now
i left home with sita how can i reenter the inner apartment without her
by sitas abduction it will be clear to the world that i lack manliness and compassion my cowardly nature will clearly manifest
after completing the period of my exile when janaka king of mithila enquires of her welfare how can i face him
if the king of videha sees me without her he will surely be distressed and will fall into a swoon for the love of his daughter
or else i will not go to the city ruled by bharata without sita even heaven will be empty for me
go to the auspicious city of ayodhya leaving me here in the woods i can never live without sita
while embracing bharata tightly repeat my words you are permitted by rama to rule the earth
my mother kaikeyi sumitra and kausalya should also be offered due obeisance you should protect them with great effort carrying out my instructions
o lakshmana subduer of the enemy this loss of sita and me should be explained in detail to my mother
when rama devoid of sita the lady with beautiful hair wailed piteously after reaching the forest lakshmana too his face pale out of fear and mind dejected felt extremely agitated     thus ends the sixtysecond sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
prince rama separated from his beloved lost his senses out of sorrow seeing his brother in a distressed state he sank again into intense grief
plunged in deep grief rama heaved hot sighs and said these words to griefstricken lakshmanaweeping
i think there is none on earth like me who has performed such forbidden acts one grief after the other is successively piercing my heart and my mind
in the past i had certainly done some sinful deeds i often liked the consequences of which have descended on me now as i am experiencing one sorrow after another
o lakshmana loss of kingdom separation from kith and kin death of father separation from motherall these thoughts augment my sorrow faster and in greater measure
o lakshmana all this sorrow calmed down when i came to this solitary forest but with sitas separation it was rekindled just as fire blazes forth again with logs of wood
the timid princess of mine forcibly carried away into the sky by a demon must have again and again cried aloud out of fear in a broken voice
her captivating copper coloured skin smeared with the best of red sandal paste would not be surely pleasing now drenched in blood and mud
her face with her clear sweet and gentle words and her curly hair falling will no more look bright coming under the grip of demons like the moon eclipsed by rahu
the bloodthirsty demons must have drunk the blood of my faithful beloved in a lonely place breaking her neck that used to wear beautiful necklaces
the lovely largeeyed lady separated from me in the desolate forest abducted and dragged by demons must have cried at that time desperately like a female osprey
on this rock o lakshmana my goodnatured lady with her lovely smile sat with me in the past and chatted with you
would she have gone to godavari the foremost of the rivers so dear at all times to my beloved but i think she has not gone there alone at any time
the lady whose face was like the lotus whose large eyes were like lotus petals could have gone to fetch lotuses but that also is not possible as she has never gone there without me
could she have gone to the forest where there are many kinds of trees in full bloom inhabited by a variety of birds that is also not possible as she is timid and too scared to go there alone
o sungod you know all the happenings of the world you are witness to all the deeds of the people true and false tell me where my beloved sita has gone or has been carried off my grief never ceases
o windgod there is nothing that you know not in all the worlds do tell me if that lady of a noble race has been abducted or dead or is on the way
while rama was thus in tears in a state of sorrow and swoon lakshmana who was rational and courageous spoke to him words appropriate to the time
o noble prince give up grief take courage show enthusiasm to search and find sita enthusiastic people will not get despondent in carrying out the most difficult tasks
rama who carries on the glorious progeny of the raghu dynasty did not however consider seriously the words of lakshmana a man of great prowess forsaking his courage he was once again overtaken by deep sorrow     thus ends the sixtythird sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
rama in dejection said these pitiable words to lakshmanao lakashmana go swiftly to the river godavari and find out if sita has gone there to get lotuses
lakshmana destroyer of enemywarriors went to the beautiful river godavari with quick steps following the instruction of rama
searching for sita at the landings of river godavari lakshmana said to rama i am unable to find her at these landingsno one responds to my call
where could vaidehi destroyer of sorrow go i wonder i am unable to trace the spot where the daughter of janaka could be found
overwhelmed with grief on hearing lakshmanas words rama himself went to river godavari and shouted where are you sita
like the elements of nature river godavari did not disclose rama that sita had been abducted by the king of demons who deserved death
river godavari although prompted by creatures of nature to tell him about his beloved did not respond to brooding rama
remembering the evilminded ravanas appearance and action the river revealed nothing about vaidehi out of fear
disappointed by the river and emaciated by not being able to see sita rama said to lakshmana
o handsome lakshmana this godavari does not at all respond how can i go to janaka and my mother without sita and break this unhappy news
where could have gone that vaidehi who removed all my sorrows and sufferings when i lost my kingdom and survived on food available in the forest
away from relatives and away from the princess i keep awake during nights which seem too long
i will roam about the river godavari janasthana and this mount prasravana till i find sita
o mighty lakshmana these deer are looking at me again and again indicating that they wish to tell me something
with his vision blurred by tears rama the best among men looked at them and asked them where is sita
thus asked by the prince all the deer got up suddenly and pointed towards the southern sky the direction in which the princess from mithila was carried off looking at the lord of men rama they started running in that direction
even lakshmana marked that the deer were showing and looking at the path lying in that direction
observing intelligently their indications and understanding the meaning of their message lakshmana said to his distressed elder brother
o lord these deer are indicating the land on the southern sidetherefore it will be proper for both of us to proceed in the southwestern direction maybe we will get some clue or find that noble sita
handsome rama said yesand started in southern direction carefully looking at the ground followed by lakshmana
talking with each other the two brothers took the path on earth strewn with flowers
seeing showers of flowers fallen on the ground valiant rama sadly said these words to sorrowful lakshmana
o lakshmana here are the same flowers i had given vaidehi to wear in the forest i can recognize them
i think the sun the wind and the famed earth have done me a favour by preserving these flowers
rigteous rama the best among men having said these words to the longarmed lakshmana asked mount prasravana full of streams
o king of the mountains have you seen a lady with beautiful limbs separated from me in this forest tract
like a lion aiming at a petty animal angry rama said o mountain before i destroy all your slopes show me that goldenhued sita with lustre like gold
thus addressed by rama the mountain echoed as if it was telling about sita but did not show her to rama
rama dasarathas son said to the mountain the fire of my arrows will reduce you to ashesyou will have no grass no tree no twig you will be unfit to be served any more
o lakshmana if this river does not tell me about that noble sita with countenance like the moon i will drain it dry right now
while rama was angry with his eyes burning he saw on the ground as he advanced large footprints of a demon and then the footprints of maithili which signified as if chased by the demon she was frightened and was running hither and thither longing to see rama
bewildered to see the broken bow and quiver and many splinters of the chariot scattered all over rama said to his loving brother lakshmana
o saumitri see the many broken bits of gold ornaments and garlands
see o lakshmana the patches of blood looking like drops of shining gold spread all over the ground
o lakshmana vaidehi might have been cut into pieces and eaten up by the demons who can assume any form at their free will
o lakshmana two demons might have fought a dreadful duel at this place contesting with each other for the sake of vaidehi
o handsome lakshmana whose is this huge bow embedded with pearls and gems and adorned with gold fallen on the ground
whose is this shield of gold studded with vaidurya broken and strewn all over the ground shining like the morning sun
whose parasol is this with a hundred spokes festooned with wonderful flowers thrown down on the ground with broken staff
whose are these donkeys with golden chestcoverings with the devils face fierceful and huge and slain in the encounter
whose war chariot with a battle flag is this shining like burning fire turned upside down and broken
whose are these pointless arrows of the size of a chariot axle adorned with bright gold destroyed and scattered who is he that has performed such terrible deeds
o lakshmana look at these two quivers filled with arrows and lying shattered the charioteer is holding a whip and reins in his hands and is lying dead to whom do they belong
o best among men o handsome lakshmana see these carriers of fans with head dress and earrings studded with gems lying slain in the combat whose are they
this indeed is the path the man or the demon has traversed my enmity with him now has become hundredfold this will end only with the extermination of his life
o handsome one those demons can change their form at will and are of dreadful nature have they abducted or devoured or killed her in this great forest even her righteousness could not protect the helpless sita
if sita has been devoured or kidnapped none in this world or even gods could do anything to make me happy o handsome lakshmana
o lakshmana even the compassionate and heroic creator of the worlds will be disrespected by all beings however ignorantly if such things are allowed to happen
the gods will certainly consider me a man engaged in the welfare of the world a man of selfrestraint and compassion but at the same time a weak man
o lakshmana even demerits turn into merits when they come in contact with me just as the sun shines effacing the moonlight my brilliance will outshine my demerits of exterminating all wicked beings including the demons
o lakshmana neither yakshas nor goblins nor demons nor kinneras nor humans will be in peace now
o lakshmana just see i will fill the sky with all my weapons and arrows and make all movements impossible in the three worlds
i will obstruct the movement of planets and the moon destroy the radiance of the sun the fire and block the wind crush the mountain tops dry up the tanks destroy the trees shrubs and creepers and annihilate the oceans i shall bring about this fatal change at once in the three worlds
if the gods do not return my sita safely to me o lakshmana they will witness my power right now
lakshmana no beings will be able to move in the sky blocked by arrows released from my bowstring there will be no space left there
o lakshmna now beasts and birds will be confused and destroyed by my dartsyou will see them crossing all limits of propriety
for the sake of maithili i will render this world devoid of goblins and demons with my irresistible arrows pulled up to my ears
now the gods will witness the power of my arrows released in great rage which can hit distant targets
my anger will destroy all the gods demons and evil spirits they will be extinghished from the three worlds
the worlds of gods yakshas or even demons torn into shreds by my arrows will not survive
if the gods do not hand over sita to me either carried away or dead i will transgress these worlds o lakshmana
if my beloved vaidehi is not given back to me in her true form i will destroy the three worlds with all animate and inanimate beings
after speaking these words handsome rama his eyes red with anger pressed his bow took out the glowing arrow that was dreadful like a poisonous serpent fixed it to his bow and said these words in a rage like the fire at the time of dissolution of the world
just as all beings in this world cannot avoid age and death or defy time and fate so also none can prevent me at all when i am angry o lakshmana
i will topsyturvy this entire world including the gods the gandharvas human beings serpents and mountains if they do not show me the princess from mithila who is blemishless and whose teeth are beautiful     thus ends the sixtyfourth sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
tormented and emaciated due to sitas abduction resembling the fire at the time of dissolution of the creation ready to destroy the world rama looked at his bow strung again and again breathing hot sighs like lord siva at the end of the creation wishing to burn down the world in a rage lakshmana who had never seen rama in such anger before said to him with folded hands and parched throat
earlier you were gentle self restrained and engaged in the welfare of all beings now it is not proper for you to give up your natural composure in anger
in you are always present the grace of the moon the radiance of the sun the motion of the wind the forbearance of the earth and reputation
to destroy the world for the mistake of a single person is not proper why and by whom is this warchariot broken with weapons and all its accesories i do not know
o prince this place is damaged by the hooves of the horses and the rims of the chariot it is soaked with drops of bloodvery dreadful must have been the fight here
o best of the eloquent this fight involves only one and not two i do not see the footprints of a big army
to destroy the entire world for one individual is not right the lords of the earth should remain gentle peaceful and punish only the deserving
you are the ultimate resort and refuge of all beings who would like that your wife should be abducted
just as pious men do not do anything disagreeable towards persons who observe religious vows so also rivers seas and mountains gods gandharvas and demons are not capable of causing unhappiness to you
o king bow in hands followed by me and with the help of great sages you should search for the one who has abducted sita
we will search oceans mountains forests and several dreadful caves rivers and lotusponds
we will search relentlessly for the abductor of your wife everywhere including the world of gods and gandharvas till we find her
o lord of kosala when gods do not restore sita on request then you can think of taking action at the appropriate time
o king if you fail to get sita through appeasement through humility or diplomacy then you destroy the three worlds by your goldtipped stream of arrows comparable to indras thunderbolt     thus ends the sixtyfifth sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
lakshmana son of sumitra consoling the mighty miserable rama who was afflicted with sorrow and was weeping helplessly like an orphan drowned in great delusion devoid of consciousness pressed his feet and addressed him
o rama king dasaratha begot you by doing a great penance and performing great deeds just as gods begot the nectar
king dasaratha impelled by your virtues and separation from you attained godhood as heard from bharata
o rama if you cannot bear this sorrow that has befallen you how can weak and ordinary persons endure such suffering
o best of men if you grieve and burn the world with your brilliance wherefrom will the ordinary afflicted people get relief
it is the go of the world yayati son of nahusa shared heaven with indra but because of his curse for his bad conduct suffered misfortune
to sage vasistha our fathers priest were born a hundred sons in a daybut all of them were killed in one day the same way
you rigidly adhere to truthlike you the mother earth who is adored by all the worlds is unshakeable yet she is seen to be shaking at times
the powerful sun and moon righteous entities who are the two eyes of these worlds and on whom everything rests firmly also suffer eclipses sometimes
o best among men fate spares none great beings every creature even the gods cannot escape fate
it is i heard that indra and other deities are also governed by the principle of justice therefore you should not bewail o tiger among men
even if vaidehi is killed or abducted you should not grieve like ordinary men o sinless hero
o rama you always see the truth so in the face of great difficulties men like you whose vision is not blurred should not lose heart
o best among men judge the facts rightly with your intellect the wise apply their minds and know what is right and what is wrong
good results are not expected from the actions of persons who cannot distinguish between their virtues and vices from those who are unstable in their deeds
o rama you yourself in the past have instructed me many times that way who can be your adviser in this matter you are indeed like brihaspati
even gods cannot fathom your intellect i am only trying to rouse your wisdom your sorrow has sent to sleep
o bull among the ikshvakus weigh your divine and human prowess before you try to kill your enemies
o best among men where is the good in the destruction of all know your sinful enemy before you uproot him     thus ends the sixtysixth sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
even though rama was elder he could grasp the quintessence of the wise counsel only after lakshmana had said it
restraining his anger the longarmed rama leaned over his wonderful bow and spoke to lakshmana
o dear lakshmana what shall we do where do we go think of some means by which we can reach sita
lakshmana said to rama afflicted with grief it is proper for you to first search in this janasthana covered with different kinds of trees and creepers and teeming with demons
here are difficult mountains caves valleys dreadful caves full of different animals dwellingplaces of kinneras and mansions of gandharvas
accompanied by me you should search for her in those spots great people endowed with wisdom do not destabilise in difficulties just as mountains are not shaken by the speed of the wind
thus advised the angry rama fixed a sharp arrow to his bow and roamed in the forest accompanied by lakshmana
then he saw the great jatayu a wonderful bird looking like a mountain top drenched in blood and fallen on the ground
on seeing jatayu looking like the peak of a mountain rama said to lakshmana there is no doubt that this bird has devoured vaidehi
this demon in the guise of a vulture has evidently eaten away the largeeyed sita and is happily relaxing in the forest with my terrific arrows with burning tips that can go straight i will kill him
having siad so rama took his bow fixed the sharp arrow and aimed at the vulture the seabound earth trembled
but the vulture who was in a piteous state vomitting foamy blood spoke these words pathetically to rama son of dasaratha
o longlived one she who you are searching in the forest like herbal medicine has been carried away by ravana along with my life
i have seen her snatched from you and from lakshmana and carried off by powerful ravana
i descended down to protect sita and in the battle with ravana his chariot destroyed fell down here on the ground
o rama this is his broken bow this is his quiver and this is his warchariot all devastated by me
he is ravanas charioteer slain by my wings in the battle as i was exhausted in the encounter ravana clipped my wings took sita and flew into the sky you need not kill me i am already slain by the demon
having known from jatayu the story of his beloved sita rama was full of tears his grief redoubled
rama dropped the bow and embraced the king of birds he fell down despondent on the ground and began crying along with lakshmana
rama saw jatayu breathing with difficulty in that solitary inaccessible placeovercome by greater grief he said to lakshmana
i have been expelled from the kingdom i am made to stay in the forest i have lost sita my beloved wife this bird who was my wellwisher has been slain such misfortune will burn even fire
now if i enter even the great sea the lord of the rivers filled with water it will also dry up due to my misfortune
in this world of the animate and the inanimate there is no one more unfortunate than me fallen into the trap of adversities
this aged king of birds is my fathers friend to my illluck he is struck down and is lying on the ground
saying such words and showing filial affection he caressed jatayu repeatedly with lakshmana
rama hugged the king of vultures with servered wings drenched in blood and asking him where sita who was as dear to him as his life was he dropped him and fell down on the ground     thus ends the sixtyseventh sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
seeing the vulture lying on the ground thrown down by the fierce demon rama said to friendly lakshmana
struck down by the demon in the combat on my account this bird is going to give up his life which is indeed difficult
o lakshmana it appears he is frightened and is experiencing excruciating pain in the body his voice sounds faint too
o jatayu if you are still able to speak tell me about sita and about how you have been struck down
why did ravana abduct sita what fault did he find with me so that he kidnapped my beloved
o best of birds how did her delightful moonlike face look when she was hijacked what did she say at that time
o father how powerful is that demon how does he lookwhat work does he do where does he dwell do answer my questions
thereafter jatayu a piteous soul looked up at rama who was crying incessantly and said this in a feeble voice
ravana the lord of the demons created violent winds through terrific magic and whisked her away in the sky
o my child when i was exhausted that demon cut off my wings and carried sita off in the southern direction
o scion of the raghu race i am gasping for breath my eyes are reeling i see root hair growing on the tops of golden trees
the time ravana kidnapped sita is known as vinda the effect of that time is that her husband will regain his lost wealth o scion of the kakutstha race he ravana did not know it
ravana king of the demons will perish soon for running away with your beloved janaki just like a fish carrying away a fishhook which causes its destruction
you need not worry about janakas daughter you will soon enjoy the company of your beloved vaidehi after killing that demon
as hejatayu was speaking to rama with an alert mind even while dying blood mixed with flesh started oozing from jatayus mouth
ravana was visravas son and vaisravanas kuberas brother said jatayu and gave up his rare life
as rama was saying to the vulture with folded palms tell me tell me about ravana the life breath of the vulture soared into the sky leaving the body
then jatayu dropped his head down his feet thrown about his body outstretched on earth
stricken with deep grief his eyes red with tears rama saw the vulture looking like a mountain seeing him dead he said to lakshmana
dwelling for many years happily in dandaka forest the abode of demons the bird lost his life on our account
this jatayu who lived for long years is lying dead now the dictate of destiny is inescapable
o lakshmana see this jatayu my benefactor killed by the powerful ravana while he was reaching out to help sita
this lord of the birds left his ancestral kingdom of viltures and gave up life for my sake
o lakshmana valiant souls and protectors being righteous and honest are found even among animals and birds
o scorcher of enemies o handsome lakshmana the grief i experience due to jatayus death on my account is more intense than sitas abduction
this lord of the birds for me is as worthy of reverence and honour as the famous and prosperous king dasaratha
o saumitri fetch firewood i shall generate fire by rubbing them and cremate the king of the birds who has laid down his life for my sake
o scion of the raghus i will place the body of the lord of the world of birds killed by the fierce demon on the funeral pyre and crimate him with honour
o mighty lord of the birds by my grace attain the state of those who perform sacrifices who kindle and maintain sacrificial fires who beat no retreat from the battlefield and who offer land in charity purified by my offering of fire you may depart for the best of the worlds
thus said righteous rama laid him on the pyre and sadly cremated the lord of the birds as one would do to his own relative
then the mighty rama accompanied by saumitri got into the forest and killed a huge deer brought it and spread it as an offering to the dead jatayu
tearing the flesh of the deer to pieces and making them into balls the celebrated rama laid it on a lovely green grassy land as offering to the bird
rama muttered the mantras recommended by brahmins for dead mortals as one would do for his father to help him ascend to heaven
then both the princes went down to river godavari and offered libations for the king of vultures
thereafter both the scions of the raghu dynasty bathed in water offered libations for the king of vultures as ordained in the scriptures
the king of vultures had performed a very difficult and glorious feat by laying down his life fighting sanctified by ramas offering as laid down in scriptures by the seers he attained a holy auspicious and divine state of the self
rama and lakshmana like two lords of gods indra and visnu offered libations for the great bird with their settled minds and concentrated and then entered deeper into the forest turning their attention to the search for sita     thus ends the sixtyeighth sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
rama and lakshmana offered libations for jatayu and went westward looking for sita in the forest
wielding bow arrows and sword both the princes of the ikshvaku race went southward and entered an untrodden densely wooded tract
it was a dense impenetrable and dreadful forest covered with shrubs trees and creepers spread all over
the two mighty heroes swiftly forged through the great forest which was an abode of serpents and lions
both the mighty princes of the raghu dynasty covered a distance of three krosas from janasthana and entered the impassable kraunchaforest
tormented due to abduction of sita the two princes anxious to see her searched all over the dense forest stopping here and there on the way the thick forest looked like a conglomeration of big clouds it was filled with different kinds of birds snakes and animals
then both the sons of dasaratha went further east crossed the kraunchaforest after three krosas they saw a dreadful forest which was full of fierce animals and birds near the hermitage of sage matanga it was densely covered with trees they saw there a cave perpetually enveloped in darkness which was as deep as the netherworld
both the princesthe best among men reached the cave and saw a huge demoness with a disfigured face not far from the cave
then the two brothers saw a fearful demoness who could strike terror in the mind of the timid an uncouth figure with huge curved skins with a big stomach dishevelled hair sharp and long teeth devouring wild animals
she came close to them held lakshmana who was walking ahead of his brother and said come let us enjoy
taking hold of saumitri the demoness said i am ayomukhi and i have been obtained by you you got me o hero o lord for the rest of your life you will sport with me on the lofty hills and river banks
thus addressed lakshmana subduer of enemies became angry took out the sword and cut off her ears nose and breasts
when the ears and nose of the frightening demoness were cut off she shouted in a fierce tone and ran away in the direction she had come from
the destroyers of enemies rama and lakshmana of great valour went through the dense forest after she ran away
lakshmana of great brilliance and power of good conduct and pure character spoke to his highly effulgent brother with folded hands
my arm is throbbing heavily my mind is agitated the omens i see foretell some undesirable events
o noble brother be alert heed my words of good advice the bad omens i see presage perils
this vanchulaka birds loud and dreadful screams suggest our triumph in war
as both the brothers with great prowess were searching for sita all over a huge sound exploded as if shattering the forest
it appeared as though a fierce wind rose from the forest and filled the sky
while looking for the sound rama with his brother saw a demon with a huge body and a big belly
then both the brothers saw a very tall figure with a trunk that stood facing them he had neither neck nor head his face was in the stomach
with sharp bristled hair all over the body he was a mammoth figure who looked like a mountain resembling a dark cloud with his voice like the thunder
he had a single eye that was reddishbrown in colour resembling flaming fire it was fixed in the chest his eyelashes glowed he had instant vision with massive fangs in his huge mouth he was licking his lips
the terrific demon kept eating bears lions deer and elephants catching with both his arms stretching up to one yojana
he stood rooted there catching bears flocks of birds and deer with both his hands stretching up to one yojana pulling and pushing them now he obstructed the path of the two brothers
then the brothers after covering one krosa miles saw a cruel fierce mighty monster named kabandha looking like a trunk he had a dreadful appearance and his arms encircled the area
the longarmed demon spread his hands and caught hold of rama and lakshmana together by pressing them with all his force
the two mighty brothers who wielded swords and strong bows and whose bodies were of fiery splendour became helpless seized by the hands of kabandha
of the two heroes rama being courageous was not worried but lakshmana being younger and not having as much courage was very much concerned and depressed he said to rama
o heroic rama see how helpless i am under the control of the demon set yourself free leaving me alone and using me as an offering
giving me to this monstor as an offering you may run away happily i think you will soon obtain vaidehi
o scion of the kakutstha dynasty on getting the hereditary kingdom and ruling over it you should always remember me
o valiant lakshmana a hero like you should not get desparate said rama to saumitri when he was thus entreated by lakshmana
in the meanwhile the foremost of the demons kabandha rumbling like thunder questioned the brothers rama and lakshmana
who are you with bulllike shoulders wielding big swords bows and arrows by coming to this place you have become my food
for what purpose have you come what work have you here you have come at the right time as my food since i am hungry
holding bows arrows and swords looking like bulls with pointed horns you have entered my mouth it is impossible for you to live any more
on hearing the words of the evilminded kabandha rama said to lakshmana with dried up mouth
o lakshmana your valour is truthwe have gone through from one calamity to a greater one without finding the beloved sita now we have landed into a terrible crisis which will put an end to our own life
o tiger among men see how powerful the might of time is for all beings just see yourself and myself afflicted wth this great calamity
o lakshmana look at the power of time over all creatures there is nothing too heavy for time even those who know the use of arms in war or are brave or strong enough cannot withstand the force of time like the barriers built with sand
firm in the strength of truth famous and powerful rama son of dasaratha determined to act with a steadfast mind spoke to lakshmana of mighty manliness on seeing him      thus ends the sixtyninth sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
kabandha saw the brothers rama and lakshmana stand there bound by the shackles of his arms and said
o bulls among the kshatriyas you are sent by destiny as food to appease my hunger seeing me hungry why do you stand there with your senses switched off
having heard this lakshmana who was greatly suffering gathered courage at appropriate time and said these salutary words
before this vile demon gulps you and me let us cut off his long arms with our swords
this huge horrible demon with the strength of his arms has conquered the world and now intends to kill us here
o prince of the raghu race just as the animal brought in the midst of a sacrifice should not be killed so also for a king to kill any harmless creature is despicable
the cruel ferocious demon heard them talk he opened his mouth and attempted to eat both of them
then the agitated brothers aware of time and space quickly pulled out their swords and cut off both his arms from the shoulders
while standing on the right rama cut off his right arm and the brave lakshmana cut off the left
the strongarmed demon his arms severed rumbling like a raincloud filling the sky the earth and the quarters fell down
the demon with his arms amputated drenched in a pool of blood looked pathetic and asked them who are you
imbued with auspicious signs lakshmana revealed the identity of rama to great kabandha
here is rama an heir of the ikshvaku family known to the people and i am his younger brother lakshmana for your information
he is equal to a god in prowess while living in this desolate forest his wife has been carried off by a demon we both came here searching for her
who are you with only the trunk of the body and a glittering mouth in the chest with your calf muscles broken rolling down in the forest
while hearing lakshmana kabandha reminded of indras words replied to him in great joy
o tigers among men you are welcome it is my good luck that i am able to see you it is my good luck also that the arms that bound you have been amputated
o best among men hear how i have been deformed due to my haughtiness     thus ends the seventieth sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
o longarmed mighty and powerful rama in the past i was handsome like the moon or indra or the sun inconceivable to all the three worlds
with my appearance i was a great nuisance to the world and used to terrorise the sages living in the forest
with my appearance i invited the wrath of sthulasira who i assaulted among the many seers while he was collecting food in the forest
seeing me he pronounced a dreadful curse on me saying you will get a cruel despicable form
when i sought to know how the curse angrily pronounced on me would come to an end he said
when rama gets your arms in a desolate forest amputated and your body cremated you would get back your gloriously auspicious form
o lakshmana know that i was the prosperous son of demon danu by the wrath of indra in the battlefeild i obtained this form
i pleased the creator brahma with great penance he blessed me with long life then this pride and confusion overtook me
having been blessed with long life and thinking what can indra do to me i attacked him
the thunderbolt having a hundred nodes deployed by indra pierced my thighs and my head
entreated he did not send me to the abode of yama lord of death and said let the words of the creator be true
hit by the thunderbolt my thighbones head and face were broken somehow i could manage to live for a long time without food
having been entreated indra created in me two long arms extending upto a yojana and set my mouth with sharp teeth in the stomach
stretching the long arms in the forest i dragged creatures like lions tigers elephants and deer moving in the forest and ate them
indra too had said when rama along with lakshmana cuts off your arms in a fight you would reach heaven
o rama the best of kings i thought it was only proper in this forest and with this body to catch whatever creature i saw
o rama i was struggling to preserve my body all the time thinking that some day you would certainly come into my arms
you are that rama be blessed as stated by the seer i cannot be really killed by any one except you
o best among men i will help you with my wisdom and give you friendly advice when i am purified by you both through cremation on the funeral pyre
rigteous rama spoke the following words in response to the story of danu within lakshmanas earshot
my illlustrious wife sita was carried away by ravana comfortably when i was away from janasthana along with my brother
i only know his name we do not know how he looks where he lives and what influence he has
creatures like you may help those who like orphans run here and there stricken with sorrow
o hero we will cremate you in a huge pit to be prepared for this occasion collecting dry logs of wood broken by elephants
if you really know where sita has been kidnapped and by whom tell me you will be doing a great service
danu who was proficient in speech spoke with chosen words to rama who was a great speaker himself
i do not have divine wisdom now nor do i know sita when you cremate me i shall assume my original form and will tell you the name of the person who knows it
o lord before i am cremated i do not have the ability to know about that powerful demon by whom sita has been abducted
o rama due to the curse i have lost my wisdom by my own deed i have attained this form despicable to the world
before the sun disappears with his tired horses drop me into a pit and cremate me in accordance with tradition o rama
o heroic rama delight of the raghus if you drop me in a pit and cremate me as per custom i will tell you about him who knows the demon
o rama you should establish friendship with him in a just manner that hero of swift action will help you when he is pleased
o rama there is nothing that he does not know in the three worlds in the past for a different reason he roamed all the three worlds     thus ends the seventyfirst sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
thus said by kabandha the two lords of men the heroes reached a cave in the mountain and lighted the fire
lakshmana lit the pyre with big meteorlike logs on all sides and it burned
as the flesh of kabandhas body decomposed if burnt slowly in the fire although it was like a huge mass of fat
mighty kabandha shook himself off the funeral pyre and rose like smokeless fire wearing a pair of clean clothes and a divine garland
thereafter shining brightly in pure clothes and wearing ornaments all over the body kabandha hurtled out happily and instantaneously from the pyre
the effulgent kabandha rose into the sky on a famous aerial chariot harnessed to swans seated on it he illuminated all ten directions and spoke from the skyo raghava i will truly tell you how you will get sita listen to me
o rama there are six expedients peacewarmarchingneutrality alliance making peace with one and waging war with another for attaining your goal in the world only the unlucky can help the unfortunate
along with lakshmna you are passing through a bad period on account of which your wife has been kidnapped and you lying low are experiencing great grief o rama
o rama the best of friends you should certainly make friendship with him as i think over the matter i do not see any success if you do not adopt this method
o rama listen i shall tell you a monkey named sugriva has been banished from the kingdom in a fit of anger by his brother vali the son of indra
a hero of great selfrespect he lives with four monkeys on a beautiful mountain rishyamuka extending up to lake pampa
this king of monkeys is energetic with great strength and limitless lustre he is humble and truthful valiant patient and intelligent he is great
he is efficient eloquent brilliant he is mighty and strong but he is banished by his brother from the kingdom o rama
o rama he will help you as a benevolent friend in searching out sita do not indulge in sorrow
o best of the ikshvaku race whatever is due to happen cannot be otherwise it is not possible to transgress time fate
o rama immediately proceed today from here to mighty sugriva having reached him make him your friend without malice in the presence of burning fire
thinking that sugriva is only a vanara king he should not be disrespected he has a sense of gratitude he can take any form at will he is in need of your help although he is very strong
you are both young and able to do the work he wants whether his work is done or not he will fulfil your task
born of riksharaja he is the offspring of the sungod he has developed enmity with vali and is roaming about the banks of pampa suspecting danger from vali
o rama with your weapons kept ready go to sugriva king of the monkeys a resident of rishyamuka he is wandering in the forest establish friendship with him
he is the foremost of the monkeys he knows well by his wisdom all the dwellingplaces of the carnivorous demons in the world
there is nothing unknown to sugriva in this world as far as the sun shines o subduer of enemies
along with his monkeys he will search all rivers mountains and caves and will find out your consort
sugriva will find out the lady of purity and chastity brooding over you in separation in the abode of ravana he can send gigantic monkeys in different directions in order to search for her
sugriva king of the monkeys will reach the demons and restore you that blameless beloved consort of yours even if she is there on top of mount meru or in the deep underworld      thus ends the seventysecond sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
having shown rama the means to find sita kabandha spoke again these significant words
o rama the delightful path going westward is auspicious for you it is shining with trees in bloom there are jambu rose apple trees priyala trees jackfruit trees banyan trees plaksha trees a tree from which milky latex oozes out tinduka trees holy fig trees karnikaras of red and white flowers mango trees and other trees like dryland thorny trees tilaka trees trees that bloom at night agnimukhya and asoka trees of blue flowers kadamba trees karavira trees red ashoka trees and paribhadraka trees
climbing those trees or else pulling them down with your strength both of you eat the nectarlike sweet fruits and proceed ahead
o scion of the kakutstha race proceeding further you will find another forest of the north kuru state with trees in bloom resembling the pleasuregardens of nandana
the trees in that garden with fruits of all seasons drip honey like the chaitraratha garden of kubera it bears fruits of all seasons
the trees with huge branches bent down with fruits look like mountains or clouds
lakshmana will get you the nectarlike fruits either by climbing the trees or by pulling them down
o brave men pass from hill to hill forest to forest in great countries until you reach a lake named pampa
the slopes of pampa are without stones or pebbles o rama they are not slippery slopes they are without moss the water is neither deep nor shallow it has smooth beds of sand on the banks and it is full of lotuses and lilies
moving in the waters of pampa you will see swans ducks krauncha birds and curlews cackling and cooing o son of the raghus
not knowing that they may be killed the innocent creatures will not be scared of human beings both of you can kill and eat the fat birds comparable to balls of ghee
o rama scion of the raghu dynasty there at pampa by shooting an arrow at the choicest fishes with a single bone prawns and big fishes crookedfaced fishes fishes without scales and fins baked on iron skewers and cooked will be offered to you by faithful lakshmana
while you delightedly eat the fishes lakshmana will fetch you water in a lotus leaf from the pampa to drink the waters of pampa full of lotuses carry their scent it is enjoyable cool healthy and clear resembling silver and crystal
o best of men you will see huge boars of delightful appearance that roar like bulls resting in mountain caves roaming in the forest and coming to pampa for its water
when you stroll in the evening you will see the trees laden with blossoms and lake pampa full of cool water you will forget your grief
o son of the raghus there you will see tilaka trees night jasmines full of flowers you will also see blossoming water lilies and lotuses in pampa
there is no one to wear those flowers those garlands do not wilt or wither o rama
while drops of sweat from the bodies of sage matangas disciples fell on earth under the heavy load of forest products they carried for their preceptor they remained in a calm state those drops of sweat turned into flowers and those flowers do not wither due to the power of penance of the sages
o kakutstha even now their attendant named sabari an old ascetic is there even though they have left long ago
o rama she is established in righteousness and you are godlike and revered by all beings when she sees you she will attain heaven
o rama of the kakutstha family you will see on reaching the western bank of pampa an incomparable site of hermitage concealed in a remote place
the elephants of the forest and on the mountains do not attack the hermitage forbidden by sage matanga
o rama you will enjoy your stay in that forest which is like nandana garden the garden of the gods full of various birds
mount rishyamuka situated on the bank of pampa has trees filled with blossoms it is difficult to climb and is protected by young elephantsthis lofty mountain was created by brahma in olden days
whatever wealth one dreams of in sleep on top of that mountain he will get on waking up o rama
if an evildoer or a sinner ascends the rishyamuka mountain he in his sleep will be thrown down with asleep by the demons from there itself a sinner does not climb this mountain of uneven terrain
o rama the trumpeting of the young playful elephants inhabiting sage matangas forest can be heard at pampa
the great nimble elphants dark like clouds drenched with the flow of ichor come together and then separate and scatter
the wandering elephants of the forest drink plentiful water pure and cool from pampa and contented plunge into the forest
when you see shining like sapphires the bears tigers antelopes who know no defeat you will get over your grief
o son of the kakutstha family there is a beautiful cave in that mountain covered with a slab of stone it is difficult to enter
at the eastern entrance of the cave there is a cool watertank on its bank teeming with various animals are delightful fruits and roots
sugriva dwells in that cave with four other monkeys at times he sits on the top of the mountain
having instructed both rama and lakshmana courageous kabandha wearing a flowergarland shone brightly like the sun in the sky
both rama and lakshmana ready to depart went near the glorious kabandha waiting in the sky and said you may go now
then kabandha said to the brothers satisfied you may go now to accomplish your task then he took leave
kabandha assumed his true form his body shining like the radiance of the sun he stood in the sky showing his form and looking at rama said make friendship with sugriva     thus ends the seventythird sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
the two princes set forth in the western direction towards pampa shown by kabandha
observing the trees loaded with honeysweet fruits on the mountain rama and lakshmana went to see sugriva
rama and lakshmana halted on the slope of the mountain and then departed for the western bank of pampa
both reached the west bank of lake pampa and saw the delightful hermitage of sabari
both reached the beautiful hermitage full of many kinds of trees there they saw sabari and went towards her
on seeing them both sabari an accomplished ascetic got up with folded hands and touched the feet of the sagacious rama and lakshmana
she offered them water to wash their feet and water to sip as per tradition then rama spoke to sabari who used to perform austere penance
o ascetic hope you have overcome your obstacles to penance you have controlled your anger and your desire for food is your austerity in progress
o sweettongued sabari have you achieved selfcontrol has your mind attained peace have your services to the preceptor yielded results
when rama asked sabari who was an old accomplished ascetic adored by siddhas she stood in front and replied
on seeing you now my penance has attained fulfilment my services to my preceptors have borne fruit
o best of men o highest of the gods my birth has become fruitful today with your worship you have made even attainment of heaven quite certain
o delight of the raghus your handsome look has sanctified me o subduer of enemies by your grace i will reach the inmperishable worlds
the men i served have ascended heaven on aerial chariots of incomparable radiance the moment you touched chitrakuta
those great honourable sages who knew the ways of dharma said rama would visit this sacred hermitage along with lakshmana he would be your guest receive him with due honour and you would attain the great inexhaustible worlds when you see him
o best among men i have collected and kept for your sake different kinds of forestfood grown on the bank of pampa
entreated by her in that manner the righteous rama spoke to sabari who was established in true knowledge
i have heard from great danu about your power if you agree i would like to see this power in person
at these words from the mouth of rama sabari took them both round the great garden
o delight of the raghus see this garden looking like the dense cloud full of animals and birds it is popularly known as matanga garden
my precepters who had perceived the supreme spirit made sacrificial offerings in this great garden invoked gods through the power of mantras they brought water and offered oblations to the sacrificial fire
this is the altar named pratyaksthali where the saints aged and exhausted by performing chandrayana whom i worshipped made offerings of flowers with trembling hands
o rama see even now they illuminate the sacrificial altars with the power of their penance they shed light in all directions with a matchless brilliance
look at the seven seas which have reached here at their mere thought as they could not reach them due to fatigue from fasting
o delight of the raghus look at the bark robes spread on the trees to dry after their bathing which are still wet
the flowers including lotuses offered by the sages while worshipping gods have not yet wilted
you have seen the entire garden and have listened what is to be heard with your permission i would like to give up this body
i wish to reach those realisers of the supreme spirit whom i served and to whom this hermitage belonged
rama and lakshmana on hearing the pious words of savari joyfully exclaimed this is really wonderful
looking at sabari who was steadfast in her vow rama said o ascetic you have worshipped me with devotion you may go wherever you like to the world you desire
with matted locks tattered bark clothes and deer skin sabari consigned her old and emaciated body to the fire at that moment with the permission of rama and ascended to heaven her body glowing like fire
adorned with wonderful ornaments and beautiful garlands anointed with fragrant unguents robed in most beautiful clothes she appeared like a streak of lightning her body shining bright and her face contented
by virtue of her selfmeditation sabari went to that sacred world where the holy sages lived because of their good deeds     thus ends the seventyfourth sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
when sabari departed for heaven with her brilliance rama contemplated about the power of sageswith lakshmana
thinking about the power of the great sages righteous rama said to lakshmana his wellwisher with singleminded devotion
o handsome one we have seen this highly wonderful hermitage where deer and tigers dwell together with mutual confidence where birds of all kinds inhabit
o lakshmana having bathed in the waters of the seven seas by taking ritualistic bath in these waters the manes are offered oblations in accordance with tradition
we have got rid of inauspicious time and good days have come therefore i feel truly happy good fortune will appear now o lakshmana o tiger among men
come let us go to pampa which is pleasing to look at sugriva the rigteous self the son of the sun has been staying for fear of vali at the shining rishyamuka not far from here
i am hastening to see that noble sugriva the mighty monkey as the search for sita depends on him o handsome one
to the words of rama who was of stable mind lakshmana replied my mind too is hastening me let us get there quickly
then rama the lord of men along with lakshmana departed from the hermitage and went to pampa
he saw the sacred lake pampa whose sweet flow of water was used by great seers it abounded in trees and creepers its surface was red with lotuses at one place white with clusters of lilies at another and with blue lotuses at other places as such it looked like a carpet with variegated colours
rama reached the matanga lake which he could see from a distance and bathed in it
lake pampa was filled with red lotuses and their fragrancethe bank was lined with blossoming mango trees and trees of several kinds like tilaka trees with fruits full of seeds like citron dhava trees white trees in bloom karavira trees loaded with flowers punnaga trees clusters of jasmine and kunda shrubs fig trees so also reeds ashoka trees atimuktaka creepors and several other trees looking like women adorned all over rama and lakshmana passed by glancing at them there were other trees full of flowers huge trees koyashtika trees with reed different kinds of birds such as peacocks parrots dwelling in the forest were screaming aloud looking at all these in that forest rama and lakshmana passed by undisturbed with a composed mind
rama saw lake pampa with cool waters and the groves on the bank filled with tilaka ashoka punnaga bakula and uddala trees
on seeing different kinds of trees and tanks the lovestriken rama visited that great lake
there were lovely pleasuregardens in full bloom filled with sal and champk trees honeybees on flowers looked lovely and bright the waters were crystalclear and fragrant with lotusesthe soft sands on the banks of pampa gleamed rama saw them again and again and described them to lakshmana
the famous mount sacred rishyamuka is situated on the bank of pampa full of blossoming trees
the mighty son of riksharaja the great soul the sun whose son was the wellknown sugriva resides on this mountain
rama said to lakshmana the best of men who had truth as his strength go to sugriva lord of the monkeys
o lakshmana deprived of the kingdom i have become a destitute with my heart attached to sita how can i live without her
having said these words to lakshmana who was listening to him with undivided attention rama the best of the raghus oppressed by love and afflicted by tears of grief entered pampa the delightful lotuslake
thereafter going slowly to a distance rama and lakshmana saw pampa surrounded by beautiful forests full of many varieties of birds     thus ends the seventyfifth sarga of aranyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
bharata set out for his maternal uncles house he took with him the sinless satrughna who is always successful in destroying foes and on whom he had bestowed his love and affection

he entertained thoughts befitting his great dynasty and honoured the code of conduct of a kshatriya he believed one could attain heavenly abode through his great achievements

he was young eloquent healthy and free from disease he was conscious of right time and place for his pursuits he was capable of ascertaining the potentiality of men he was born a sage in this world
bestowed with such excellent qualities the prince rama became a favourite of his subjects he was like their vital life outside their bodies
with the appropriate sacred ablution marking the completion of the vow relating to the respective branches of learning in accordance with tradition this elder brother of bharata achieved proficiency in the vedas and its auxiliary sciences he surpassed his father in archery
born in a family of noble descent he was saintly a man without meannesshe was truthful and a man of rectitude the training he received under aged brahmins conversant with dharma and artha made him welldisciplined

he was incapable of being repressed even by the enraged devatas or rakshasas in the battle he was free from envy and had subdued his anger and pride he was never malicious and he never slighted any living being nor did he bow to the pressure of time
thus endowed with such excellent qualities the subjects in the three worlds held him in high esteem in forbearance he was like the earth in wisdom like brihaspati and in prowess like the consort of sachi indra
rama whose virtues were cherished by all his subjects was a source of delight to his father and he shone like the rays of the resplendent sun
the earth desired him as her lord for he was bestowed with such avowed virtues and with indomitable prowess equal to all the guardians of the quarters
observing his son endowed with such innumerable and incomparable virtues king dasaratha subduer of enemies started thinking
thereafter flashed in the mind of that aged king who had already lived long this pleasant thought as to how rama will become king while he was alive
the thought of seeing his dear son coronated repeatedly surfaced his mind so great was his affection for rama
he said to himself his ramas only desire is to promote the prosperity of this world he is one who shows compassion to all beings and is like the raingod dearer than me to the people of the world
in prowess he is equal to yama and indrain wisdom to brihaspati and in firmness to a mountain and in virtues greater than me
seeing my son ruling this entire dominion of the earth i will experience the bliss of attaining heaven at this age
king dasaratha in consultation with his ministers observed that rama is endowed with various virtues not found in other kings immeasurable virtues which are praiseworthy and exemplary he is distinguished in this world as all qualities seem to have merged in him the king then made up his mind to make him princeregent
the sagacious king too perceived his body ageing and the portentous omens in the heaven in the sky and on the earth causing dreadful concern
the king realised afterwards that his grief would be dispelled if noble rama whose countenance resembled the full moon and who was a favourite of the people is crowned
longing for it the noble king realized that the time was ripe for the acceleration of the process of safeguarding his own and his subjects welfare
the king did not invite both the kings of kekaya and janaka in haste with an intention that they would hear the glad news at a later date
the king who received them in a befitting manner and provided them with residence and ornaments looked like lord brahma adorned by the people
after the king dasaratha who was a tormenter of enemy forces was seated the rest of the kings beloved of their subjects entered the assembly hall
then the kings who entered the assembly took the seats assigned to them facing the king dasaratha following the royal tradition
surrounded by those feudatory kings endowed with modesty and received with due honour and by the respectful residents of cities and villages the king dasaratha resembled lord indra the thousand eyed encircled by the gods     thus ends the first sarga of ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
thereafter the lord of the earth king dasaratha addressed the entire assembly of invitees he spoke these pleasing words aimed at their welfare which thrilled and delighted the hearts of the assembled kings
lord of men king dasaratha addressed the feudatory kings with words deep resonant loud like the kettledrum or the rumbling cloud in a delightful incomparable and attractive voice that carried all the dignity of royalty
it is wellknown to all of you that people of this greatest kingdom were ruled by my predecessors who were great kings who looked after the subjects as though they were their own children
i desire to accomplish the welfare of this entire world which deserves the happiness brought about by the rule of all the ikshvaku kings
following the path of my forefathers i protected the people to the best of my ability by being ever vigilant
my body has attained old age after ruling the entire world ensuring the welfare of the people under the shade of royal white parasol
having lived for thousands of years this body is now worn out due to old age and therefore i want rest
i am weary of carrying on the heavy burden of duty and find it difficult to sustain the rule of dharma it can be shouldered by those who have royal qualities of might courage etc and not by those who have not controlled their senses
therefore after convincing all of you the best of learned brahmins present here i intend to take rest by installing my son to look after the welfare of the people
my eldest son rama inheriting every virtue of mine is a conqueror of enemy cities and is equal to indra in prowess
i propose to install him rama foremost among upholders of righteousness and the best of men who resembles the moon in brightness when in conjunction with pushya star as heirapparent to the throne

i shall be relieved of my anxiety by entrusting the land ruled by me to my son rama without any more delay and thus ensure the continued welfare of this world
although it this decision is personally favourable to me and i have decided after seeking good counsel you should also give me your consent and tell me what i should do
although this is what i would like to do please suggest alternative ways of achieving the welfare of this kingdom deliberations by the unbiased on this issue may bring good
having thus heard king dasaratha speak the kings acclaimed him with delight like peacocks crying in joy to see thick clouds
there emanated cries of love and joy from the multitude of people conveying their approval whose reverberation seemed to shake the palace
brahmins kings and other prominent men inhabitants of towns and villages having fully known the views of dasaratha who was conversant with artha and dharma joined together and deliberated they thought out well and having arrived at unanimity in their thinking thus addressed the aged king dasaratha

the citizens held out their palms folded like lotuses in reverence and urged king dasaratha in all possible ways to coronate rama he reciprocated their respect with words preasing and beneficial to them
i am immensely happy that you have added to my incomparable resilience with your desire to see my beloved eldest son installed heirapparent
having honoured them the invitees in return for their response king dasaratha addressed vasistha vamadeva and other brahmins
this auspicious month of chaitra is sacred with its blossoming groves let all the arrangements be made for the installation of rama as heirapparent on hearing this all the members of the assembly applauded the king tumultously
with the tumult gradually calmed down the lord of the people the king dasaratha spoke this to vasistha a tiger among ascetics
o revered one you should issue appropriate orders to keep ready the necessary articles required for the performance of installation ceremony of rama
hearing the words of the king vasistha best of the brahmins thus ordered the counsellors who stood in front of the king with folded palms
by tomorrow early morning arrange in the place set aside for sacred fire in the kings palace gold and other metals gems articles of worship also herbs garlands of white flowers roasted corn honey and clarified butter in separate containers fresh clothes chariot weapons of every kind army of four divisions an elephant possessing auspicious marks white fans made of yaks hair a standard white parasol a hundred golden vessels shining like fire a bull with goldplated horns and a tiger skin
even the smallest items required be arranged let the gates of the inner apartment and of the entire city be decorated with sandalpaste and garlands let fragrant incense be burnt for worship
arrange fine rice cooked with milk and curd sufficient for a hundred thousand brahmins to eat to their hearts content
at dawn tomorrow the best of brahmins be honoured with cooked rice clarified butter curd roasted corn and gifts in abundance
as soon as the sun rises tomorrow arrangements be made for swastivachana a benedictory utterance brahmins be invited and seats provided to them
banners be fastened and royal highways be sprinkled with water all actors and beautifully adorned courtesans should reach the second inner apartment of the kings residence and remain seated there
persons to cater food and other eatables and to hold garlands and gifts be stationed at all temples and other places of worship
let all the warriors in fresh clothes armed with long swords and fully alert enter the courtyard of the glorious king
the two highly selfdisciplined ascetics vasistha and vamadeva having ordered the tasks to be performed and whatever remained to be done reported to the king
satisfied with the arrangements the two illustrious brahminsvasistha and vamadeva approached the lord of the earth dasaratha with delight and said all things have been arranged in accordance with your word of command
thereafter the glorious king said to sumantra bring immediately the selfpossessed rama
in response to the kings command sumantra the best of charioteers said so be it and fetched rama in a chariot
after sumantra had gone the kings from eastern northern western southern nonaryan and aryan countries rulers from forests and mountains paid homage to king dasaratha as devatas do to indra
the rajarsi dasaratha seated among the kings like indra amidst maruts beheld his son rama sitting in a chariot and approaching him
rama appeared as the very image of king of the gandharvas known for his courage in this world with his long arms he was extremely handsome with a countenance of the colour of moonstone possessed of immense strength he walked with the gait of an intoxicated elephant he captivated the eyes and hearts of men with his beauty and generosity he looked like parjanya raingod gladdening men scorched by heat even after intensely gazing at rama approaching the king dasaratha was not satiated
sumantra assisted rama while alighting from that splendid chariot and followed him with folded palms as rama was proceeding towards his father
best among men rama accompanied by charioteer sumantra ascended that palace that was lofty as the peak of kailasa mountain in order to see the king
rama approached his father with folded palms and bowed low near him pronounced his own name and touched his fathers feet with reverence
seeing his beloved son rama who was standing by his side with folded hands in supplication king dasaratha held his folded hands and drew him near and embraced him
the king dasaratha offered rama a seat on the lofty glorious throne splendidly decorated with gold and gems
the lofty seat rama occupied was illuminated by him resplenderce like mount meru in the translucent rays of the morning sun
that assembly was illumined by the presence of rama like the moon dazzling the clear autumnal sky bespangled with sparkling planets and stars
the king was delighted to see his beloved son as though he saw his own reflection adorning a mirror
the best among fathers he dasaratha said these words to his son with a smile like kasyapa addressing devendra
a worthy son of my worthy eldest wife o rama your great virtues have endeared you to me
as you have endeared yourself to these subjects with your virtues you shall assume the office of heirapparent when pushya star is in conjunction with the moon
admittedly gentle by nature you are gifted with virtues o son even though virtuous i shall offer you counsel for your good out of affection for you
with humility always keep your senses under control keep off all violations arising out of lust and anger
with your behaviour keep the ministers and the people satisfied by means direct or indirect
you shall rule the earth by filling granaries of foodgrains and arsenals and keeping the subjects loyal and contented the friends of such a person will memain pleased like devatas with nectar hence conduct yourself with your mind under control
having heard this ramas friends quickly reported the matter to kausalya so that she might be happy
the foremost of women kausalya ordered gifts of gold cows and various kinds of gems to be given to the messengers who brought this good tiding
having paid his obeisance to the king rama ascended the chariot amidst the acclaim of multitudes of men and left for his splendid abode
on hearing such pronouncement by the king the citizens also felt they have got something beneficial for themselves they took leave of the king dasaratha and hastening home full of joy began worshipping their gods     thus ends the third sarga of ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
after the citizens departed the king an expert in decisionmaking again consulted his counsellors and said tomorrow pushya star is in the ascendence and my son rama handsome with coppercoloured eyes which resemble red lotus petals will be installed heirapparent
therafter king dasaratha on retiring to his private apartment ordered sumantra to bring rama once again
in obedience to the command of the king charioteer sumantra set out speedily to the palace of rama to fetch him back once again
the doorkeepers informed rama of sumantras arrival as soon as he learnt that sumantra was back again rama was filled with apprehensions
rama got sumantra admitted and said to him what is the purpose of your coming back so quickly tell me whatever is there without holding back
then sumantra replied the king desires to see you to go or not to go the decision is yours
on hearing the words of the charioteer rama immediately set out for the royal palace to see the king again
having heard of ramas arrival king dasaratha got him admitted into his apartment to tell him something very pleasant
on entering his fathers palace glorious rama folded his hands and bent low in reverence from a distance and beheld his father
as he rama was bending with reverence dasaratha lifted him up and embraced him thereafter he offered him a splendid seat and said again
o rama after a long life i have grown old i have enjoyed all the pleasures i desired i have also performed hundreds of rituals which enjoined distribution of abundant food and gifts
o best of men i have obtained now a progeny of my liking in you and you have no equal on earth i have given gifts performed rituals and also studied the vedas
o mighty son i have experienced all the pleasures i longed for i redeemed my debt to the gods the sages my ancestors brahmins and to myself
there is nothing left to be done by me except your consecration hence you should perform what i tell you
today all the subjects expresed their desire to see you as their king therefore my dear son i wish to coronate you heirapparent
moreover rama these days i see frightening and ominous events in dreams during day time i see meteors accompanied by thunders falling generating great sounds
o rama astrologers also tell me that formidable planets sun mars and rahu have afflicted my birth star
when such ominous signs appear usually the king either meets with death or faces a grave calamity
therefore before my mind is deluded i wish to see you installed as heirapparent for a mans mind is unstable indeed o rama
today the moon is in conjunction with the punarvasu constellation tomorrow the moons conjunction with the pushya constellation is certain and the astrologers say this auspicious time is highly suitable for the purpose of coronation
my mind is hastening me sayingcoronate rama in the pushya constellation itself o slayer of enemies i shall install you heirapparent tomorrow
therefore you and my daughterinlaw sita should fast tonight and sleep on a bed of darbha or kusha grass with selfrestraint
many impediments befall acts of this sort indeed alert your friends to protect you from all sides today onwards
while bharata is away from the city the time is favourable for your installation this is my opinion
it is true your brother bharata has adhered to the path of the virtuous and has followed his elder brother no doubt he is righteous compassionate and self controlled
yet i think even the propitious minds of those who are virtuous and whose thoughts are fixed in righteousness can also become fickle
having spoken to rama about the installation ceremony fixed for the next day he dasaratha permitted him to leave saying you may go rama paid obeisance to his father and returned to his abode
with the installation fixed by the king rama went into his residence but left immediately to see his mother in her inner apartment
there he beheld his mother in silk apparel engrossed in silent prayer to the gods for his royal fortune in the room meant for the worship of the gods
hearing the welcome tidings of the installation of her beloved rama sita too had been brought in sumitra and lakshmana had already arrived there
at that moment kausalya was meditating with her eyes halfclosed sumitra lakshmana and sita were attending on her
having heard that installation of her son as heirapparent was planned in pushya constellation kausalya was meditating upon the supreme person lord visnu by controlling her breath pranayama
while she kausalya was in that state of meditation rama approached her offered reverential salutation and said these words of praise enhancing her joy
o mother father has assigned me the duties of governing the subjects my installation takes place tomorrow on my fathers command
tonight sita the officiating priests and preceptors will take to fasting along with me this is what father told me
the installation takes place tomorrow perform today whatever auspicious rituals are appropriate to the occasion for me and vaidehi sita
hearing this long cherished tiding relating to installation kausalya spoke to rama in sweet but indistinct words due to tears of joy
o my dear child o rama may you live long let your enemies be destroyed endowed with prosperity bring delight to my relatives and those of sumitra
o rama my little child you were born to me under a lucky star on this account you have delighted your father dasaratha with your virtues what a joy
o my son my devotion to the lotuseyed visnu enduring the pain of observance of vows and fasting have not gone in vainthe royal fortune of the ikshvakus will pass on to you what a joy
thus spoken to by his mother rama looked at his brother lakshmana sitting humbly with folded palms and with a smile said to him
o lakshmana rule this earth together with me this royal fortune also accrues to you for you are my second innermost self
o son of sumitra enjoy all pleasures you wish and the fruits of royalty i desire this life and kingdom for your sake only
after speaking to lakshmana rama made reverential salutation to the two mothers and on obtaining their consent to leave with sita returned to his abode     thus ends the fourth sarga of ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
the king having instructed rama summoned vasistha the priest and spoke to him about the coronation that was to take place on the following day
could you o sage whose wealth is asceticism go to rama engaged in strict observance of vows and advise him along with sita my daughterinlaw to undertake fast for securing prosperity fame and kingdom
venerabel vasistha the best amongst the knowers of the vedas skilled in mantras and firm in his vows said to the king be it so thereafter mounted on the best of the chariots befitting a brahmin with horses harnesed he proceeded personally to the abode of rama to ask him to undertake a fast in accompaniment with mantras preceding the installation ceremony
having crossed the three courtyards in the chariot that foremost of ascetics vasistha entered ramss abode shining like a mass of white clouds
seeing the venerable sagevasitha arrive rama quickly came out of his abode in great excitement to receive him with honour
hastening with rapid strides rama approached the chariot of the sagacious vasistha and personally helped him alight from the chariot
the family priest vasistha also having gratified him by enquiring about his welfare said thus to rama who was humble and lovable
o rama welldisposed towards you your father will declare you heirapparent do undertake fast today along with sita
your father king dasaratha will be pleased to coronate you as heirapparent early tomorrow morning as nahusa did to his son yayati
the ascetic vasistha having thus spoken to rama made him undertake fast along with sita in accompaniment with sacred hymns
thereafter vasistha preceptor of the king duly honoured by the descendant of kakutstha rama left his abode
rama also sat for a while in the company of his sweettongued friends and duly honoured by them in every way took leave of them and entered his apartment
the residence of rama full of cheerful men and women looked splendid like a lake with fullblown lotuses flocked by multitudes of intoxicated birds
vasistha thereafter emerged from the abode of rama resembling a royal palace and beheld the highways filled with people
the royal highways in the city of ayodhya were jammed on all sides with groups of curious people
the highways resembled the sea and the exultation of the multitudes the roar that emanated from the clashing of waves
on that day the thoroughfares of the city of ayodhya surrounded with pleasure gardens were sprinkled with water and swept the flags on the top of the houses were raised high
then all the people living in ayodhya including women children and aged alike wishing to see the coronation of rama eagerly waited for the sunrise
people were anxious to witness that great festival of ayodhya which was to them precious like an ornament and a source of immense joy
the priest vasistha beholding the overcrowded highway forced his passage through the crowds of men dividing them into two tracts and slowly entered the royal palace
having ascended the royal palace resembling the peak of a mountain covered with white clouds vasistha approached the king like brihaspati meeting indra
on seeing vasistha the king descended from the throne and enquired whether he had performed the mission to which the ascetic replied affirmatively
all those present in the assembly with him the king also got up from their seats as he dasaratha did and paid their obeisance to vasistha
the king then dully permitted by the preceptor disposed the assembly of men and stepped into his inner apartment like a lion entering the cave of a mountain
the king entered the inner apartment thronged with excellently attired women which looked like the palace of mahendra he resembled the beautiful moon that illuminates the sky crowded with stars     thus ends the fifth sarga of ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
with the family priest vasistha gone rama had his bath and with his mind under control came to lord narayana along with his largeeyed consort sita with an intention to worship him
then holding the vessel containing havis on his head he offered the oblations of clarified butter into the sacred fire for visnu in accordance with ritual practices
the son of the king rama partook the remainder of the havis seeking his own welfare with a restrained mind and a vow of silence he meditated upon lord narayana and slept along with vaidehi on a wellspread bed of kusha grass in the auspicious temple of lord visnu
he got up rama with one yama three hours of the night still left and had his entire residence decorated
then in the last watch of the night hearing the pleasant words of bards and panegyrists he attended to early morning rites and intoned gayatri with a concentrated mind
clad in spotless silk garments he extoled lord madhusudana visnu with his head bowed low he listened to the purificatory mantras recited by brahmins
and then the deep and sweet proclamations of this is an auspicious day mingled with the sounds of trumpets reverberated the city of ayodhya
the residents of ayodhya were happy to hear that the scion of the raghus rama along with princess of videha sita had undertaken the fast
having heard about the coronation of rama all the citizens began to decorate the city soon after daybreak
banners of varying colours and flags were raised on the temples looking resplendent like peaks wreathed by a mass of white clouds at the crossroads on the thoroughfares on the trees standing on avenues on the towers and stalls of the merchants abounding in various kinds of merchandise on prosperous and graceful houses of householders in all public halls and on trees looking tall from a distance
troupes of actors and dancers entertained the people with songs pleasing to the mind and ears and their utterances were heard here and there
as the time for ramas coronation was approaching men in public squares and in private houses talked with one another about the consecration of rama
similarly children playing in groups in front of the houses also related to each other stories regarding the coronation of rama
on the occasion of ramas coronation the highway strewn with flowers and rendered fragrant with the burning of incense by the citizens looked glorious
in the same way lest night should fall by the time the installation ceremony was completed the streets were provided with lamps in the shape of trees to light them up
thus the residents of ayodhya decorated the city and eagerly waited for ramas cornonation as heirapparent gathered in groups at public squares and in the assembly halls they conversed among themselves about the event praising dasaratha the lord among men
oh having realised that he himself has grown old the highsouled king dasaratha the veritable delight to the ikshvaku race is going to coronate rama in the kingdom
all of us are fortunate indeed that rama who knows the worlds high and low shall be our king protector for a long time
this scion of the raghus rama is free from arrogance is learned righteous and affectionate towards his brothers as much as towards us
may the virtuous and sinless king dasaratha live long by whose grace we are beholding going to behold ramas coronation
having heard about the coronation of rama villagers arrived from all directions and listened to the citizens conversing in this manner
the city was filled with villagers coming from different directions to behold ramas coronation
the multitudes of men moving to and fro gave rise to a noise like the roar of the ocean enhanced by the violent speed of the wind on the full and new moon days
the city of ayodhya resembling the abode of indra amaravati crowded with villagers from all over wishing to witness it the coronation of rama grew noisy and sparkled like the water of the ocean teeming with aquatic animals     thus ends the sixth sarga of ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
the family maid manthara of kaikeyi who had been living with her since her kaikeyis birth casually ascended the palace gleaming white like the moon
manthara beheld from that palace the whole of ayodhya with its highways sprinkled with water and strewn with a lot of flowers
the city of ayodhya was decorated with costly banners and pennants the labyrinthine roads were crowded with people who had finished their headbath and were wandering at will the temples with their doors painted white were reverberating with the chanting from the vedas by the best of brahmins holding garlands and sweetmeats in their hands and with sounds of all kinds of musical instruments the city was filled with spirited horses and elephants the bulls were bellowing and the cows were lowing the citizens with great joy raised the penants encircling the city of ayodhya all this left manthara astonished
seeing a royal maid clad in white silk garment and standing not very far with her eyes expanded in delight manthara enquired
why is ramas mother forever interested in the accumulation of money gifting away her wealth to men with great joy
why do the people look exceedingly happy tell me what the king with great delight is proposing to do
bursting with great joy the royal maid related to the hunchback the great fortune awaiting the son of the raghus rama
tomorrow under the spell of the pushya star king dasaratha will consecrate blameless rama born in the race of raghu as heirapparent the maid said
having heard these words of the royal maid the hunchback became furious and speedily descended from that palace resembling the peak of mount kailasa
the malevolent manthara on fire with fury reached kaikeyi lying upon her couch and said
o senseless one why are you lying down get up a great fear is gripping you why dont you realise that you are floating in a sea of perils
though you appear to be your husbands darling in reality he dislikes you the good fortune you boast of indeed is unstable like the stream of a river in summer
at these harsh words of the furious evileyed hunchback kaikeyi fell into great despondency
kaikeyi said to the hunchback o manthara isnt all well with you i can mark it from your dejected face how greatly distressed you feel indeed
hearing the words of kaikeyi uttered in a gentle voice wrathful manthara skilled in speech said
that hunchback feeling still more depressed in her kaikeyis interest and intending to cause in her despondency and distance rama from her spoke out
o queen your end is approaching and it has no end and it is overwhelming king dasaratha is crowning rama as heirapparent
plunged in unfathomable fear and stricken with grief and tears i am here seeking your wellbeing and yet consumed as though by fire
o kaikeyi your sorrow will augment my sorrow your prosperity would mean my prosperity there is no doubt about this
o queen born in the royal family and being a kings consort why dont you realise the ruthless ways of statecraft
your husband speaks morals publicly but in private he is deceitful he speaks gently but acts cruelly because of your innocent nature you are beguiled by him you do not understand this
when your husband approaches you he swears in meaningless appeasing words but today he is going to bestow benefit on kausalya only
that evilminded one having sent bharata away to your relations house is going to install rama unhindered in the kingdom at dawn tomorrow
o innocent lady with the intention of doing good like a mother to your husband who is your enemy you are holding on your lap a venomous serpent
king dasaratha has done to you and to your son the same thing as a snake or an enemy would do when ignored
o senseless lady you are always accustomed to comfort with deceitful words of appeasement that vicious one king dasaratha is going to install rama in the kingdom you along with your son have been surely ruined
o enchantingeyed kaikeyi that appropriate time has come act quickly for your own wellbeing save yourself your son and me too
hearing the words of manthara kaikeyi of charming countenance lying in her couch rose full of joy like the autumnal streak of the moons crescent
filled with immense joy and wonder at the news kaikeyi gifted a beauthful ornament to that hunchback
kaikeyi the best among the beauties having given the ornament to manthara the hunchback looked at her and said these words again
o manthara the news you have brought me is exceedingly pleasant what more can i do for you here is the gift for one who brings good tidings
i do not see any distinction between rama and bharata as such i am contented with ramas consecration in the kingdom
o woman worthy of affection for me there is nothing greater and dearer than this news i will grant you another reward better than this just ask for it     thus ends the seventh sarga of ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
annoyed with kaikeyi and filled with rage and sorrow manthara discarded the ornament gifted to her and said these words
o foolish woman why do you display this misplaced happiness little realising that you are in the midst of an ocean of sorrow
o queen at a time when this great misfortune has befallen you you are rejoicing instead of feeling miserable i am indeed laughing at you at heart
i pity your false notion will any wise woman rejoice at the prosperity of the son of a cowife who is like an enemy this is like courting death
since bharata and rama have equal claim to the kingdom bharata is a source of fear for rama having thought over this matter i am dejected danger springs from one who is in fear
lakshmana who wields a great bow has taken refuge with all his heart in rama a descendant of kakutstha dynasty so does satrughna in bharata
o beautiful lady in order of birth too bharatas right to the throne is just next to ramas while being younger the chances of the other two lakshmana and satrughna are remote
rama is learned in the duties of a kshatriya he is wise enough to do what he should at the appropriate time while reflecting the fate of your son i am trembling with fear
kausalya whose son is going to be coronated as heirapparent by eminent brahmins under pushya star tomorrow is fortunate indeed
with folded palms like an attendant you will have to serve that renowned kausalya who is greatlly delighted by getting rid of her enemies
if you thus become her attendant along with us your son will also develop slavishness towards rama
all the women of ramas palace will be delighted indeed with the decline of bharata your daughtersinlaw will be deprived of all happiness
having seen that morose manthara speaking thus kaikeyi commended the virtues of rama
rama knows righteouness he has been taught selfrestraint by elders he is grateful and truthful he is undefiled he is the eldest son of the king therefore he deserves to be the heirapparent of the kingdom
blessed with a long life rama will protect his brothers and the servants like a father o hunchback hearing ramas coronation why are you aggrieved
after a hundred years of ramas rule bharata the best of men will get the kingdom of his ancestors
manthara we have enjoyed prosperity in the past we are enjoying it now and we will enjoy it in future then why are you aggrieved
for me if bharata is worthy of consideration rama is worthier he serves me even more scrupulously than he does kausalya
if the kingdom is ramas it is also bharatas since rama regards his brothers as his own self
having heard kaikeyis words manthara was extremely unhappy heaving deep hot sighs she said to kaikeyi
you are sinking in the sea of sorrow widened with tears and troubles but you are stupid enough not to perceive your own wellbeing
rama the scion of the raghus will become king after rama his son will suceed him o kaikeyi as for bharata he will be debarred from royal succession altogether
o lovely lady not all the sons of the king will inherit the kingdom if all of them are installed as kings there will be great disorder
o kaikeyi of beautiful limbs for that reason kings bestow the governance of the kingdom either on the eldest or on other virtuous sons
o kaikeyi dear cut off from royal succession as well as from its comforts your son will become totally forlorn and brokenhearted
i am here to serve your interest nevertheless you do not understand me and you wish to confer gifts on me on the occasion of the prosperity of your cowife
rama having secured the thornless kingdom will banish bharata from the country or else send him to the other world this is certain
bharata has been sent by you right from his childhood to his maternal uncles house proximity creates friendship even amongst the inanimate objects
satrughna who is obedient to bharata has followed him like lakshmana who has taken refuge in rama he has also resorted to bharata
it is said that a tree intended to be cut down by those living on the forest is let off due to entanglement of a kind of grass known as ishika thorny bushes growing in its vicinity if bharata had been at ayodhya now dasaratha himself would have helped him
just as lakshmana protects rama rama protects lakshmana their brotherhood is renowned in the world like that of the ashwins
rama will do no harm to lakshmana as for bharata rama will doubtless do him harm
therefore let your son go to the forest straight from his uncles palace only that alone will please me for you also this is highly beneficial
if bharata secures the ancestral kingdom righteously it will bring welfare to you and to your relations also
your son that young bharata is accustomed to comforts he is a born enemy of rama how will he deprived of all wealth live under the control of rama
like the leader of an elephantherd attacked by a lion in the forest bharata is going to be oppressed by rama you should save him
being fortunate being the favourite wife of your husband you slighted your cowife earlier with pride how will she ramas mother kausalya remain without retaliating
o lovely lady when rama becomes the lord of this earth with its oceans mountains and cities then along with bharata you will become miserable and fall into disgrace
when rama obtains this earth bharata will be certainly ruined therefore right now think of the kingdom for your son and the means of banishment for your enemy rama      thus ends the eighth sarga of ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
thus spoken to kaikeyi her face burning with anger breathed a deep hot sigh and said these words to manthara
today i shall at once banish rama from here into the forest and get bharata coronated as heirapparent without delay
o manthara now see for sure bharata and not rama will get the kingdom by any means
thus addressed by queen kaikeyi that evil minded manthara said this to kaikeyi in order to spoil the interest of rama
o kaikeyi what a joy i shall now tell you how your son bharata alone will secure the kingdom listen to me
o kaikeyi dont you remember in your own interest what im going to tell you or are you hiding it wishing to hear from me
o lovely kaikeyi if it pleases you to hear from me i shall tell you listen and think over it too
after hearing mantharas words kaikeyi got up a little from her wellspread bed and said this
o manthara tell me the means by which bharata and not rama will secure the kingdom in any circumstances
thus addressed by the queen kaikeyi the evileyed hunchback manthara said with the intention to damage ramas interest
o queen during the war between gods and asuras your husband went with royal saints intending to render assistance to indra king of the gods taking you along with him he set off in the southern direction of dandaka forest to a renowned city called vaijayanta where asura timidhvaja lived
that mighty asura wellknown as sambara capable of a hundred deceitful forms challenged indra to a battle which could not be conquered by hosts of gods
in that great battle the rakshasas used to kill by force the warriors wounded by the weapons and those fast asleep during the night
there in that great battle the mightyarmed king dasaratha lay wounded with weapons used by the asuras
o queen you had protected your husband by carrying him away from the battlefield when he lost his consciousness he was saved by you once again you saved him when he lay wounded with weapons hurled by the asuras
o auspiciouslooking one out of gratitude he had granted two boons to you for saving him on two occasions o queen then you told your husband that whenever you desire you will ask for those boons the magnanimous king said so be it
o queen i did not know this indeed only you had related it to me earlier because of my affection towards you i have retained it in my memory now prevent preparations for ramas consecration by force
ask your husband for those two boons namely consecration of bharata and banishment of rama for fourteen years
if rama is banished into the forest for fourteen years your son will be firmly established in the kingdom by affectionately winning the hearts of the people
o kaikeyi daughter of ashwapati enter now the chamber of wrath like one in angry mood wearing soiled garments and lie down on the bare ground
immersed in grief and in tears neither look at him dasaratha nor even talk to him when you see him
no doubt you have always been a beloved wife to your husband for your sake the great king will even enter into the burning fire
the king is afraid of inciting your ire when you are angry he dare not look at your indignant countenance indeed he will forsake even his life for your pleasure
the king would not dare transgress your words o wicked woman recognise the power of your beauty
king dasaratha may give you gems pearls gold and different kinds of precious stones do not pay them any attention
o fortunate kaikeyi make him recollect the two boons he had granted you in the war between gods and demons you should not ignore your objective
when dasaratha personally lifts you from the floor and asks you what you want you may make him settle down and ask him for these boons
o best of kings exile rama into the forest for fourteen years and make bharata king of the land
after rama has been exiled into the forest for fourteen years your son grown strong and deeprooted will remain king for the rest of his life
o devi demand ramas exile as a boon o lovely queen this way all the interests of your son will be fulfilled protected
thus if rama is exiled he will no longer be rama be able to cause delight to the people bharata will become king with his enemy subdued
by the time rama returns from the forest your son now confident would have become deep rooted by gaining the company of friends and the acceptability of the people
i think the proper time has come to ask for the boons without fear refrain the king forcibly from his intention of installing rama
thus having been made to accept the evil design as a beneficial objective kaikeyi understood the entire matter and in delight spoke to manthara
that kaikeyi even though endowed with sound foresight expressed her sense of wonder at the words of the hunchback and chose a wrong path like a young immature girl
she said o hunchback i never knew that you can speak such excellent words or decide things intelligently you are the best among the hunchbacks of this world
o hunchback you alone always show interest in my affairs and seek my welfare i might not have known the intended deceptive action of the king without you
there are many hunchbacks in this world terribly ugly with their bodies misshaped and crooked but you look beautiful like a lotus bent by the breeze
your breasts are thick and are as high as your shoulders beneath them lies your belly with its beautiful navel waist looking slender as if out of bashfulness
you have full hips round and plump breasts your countenance equals the bright moon how passionate you look manthara
your hips glitter with the jingling girdle strong are the calfs of your legs and long are your feet
o manthara when clad in silk garment you walk in front of me with your heavy thighs you look like a female royal swan
in you reside a thousand deceitful means more than all the thousand mayas tricks of sambara king of the asuras was capable of
your clever thoughts magic powers and also the skills of kshatriyas are stored in your huge hump which is as wide as the hub of a chariot wheel
o hunchback with rama gone to the forest and bharata consecrated i shall drape this hump with a golden garland
o manthara when my objective is accomplished and i am fully satisfied i will smear your hump with the best of refined liquid gold
o manthara i shall get a tilaka made of gold for your auspicious lovely face and shall also order exquisite ornaments for you
you shall move about wearing lovely garments like a goddess with a peerless countenance as if challenging the moon and feeling proud you will attain a state of eminence amidst your enemies
other hunchbacks adorned with all sorts of ornament shall also serve you in the same manner as you are serving me
flattered in this manner manthara addressed kaikeyi who was lying on a white couch and looking like a flaming fire on the sacrificial altar
o fortunate one construction of a dike is not undertaken after the water has flowed down act before the king to the best of your interest
that beautiful largeeyed kaikeyi puffed with the pride of her intoxicating beauty encourged and influenced by the words of that hunchback entered the chamber of wrath she cast off her highly precious pearl necklace worth many hundreds of thousands of rupees and other costly beautiful ornaments thereafter that goldenhued kaikeyi lay down on the floor and said to manthara
o hunchback tell the king either bharata shall secure the kingdom on ramas departure to the forest or else i will die here
i do not aspire for gold nor gems nor ornaments if rama is installed that will be the end of my life
addressing queen kaikeyi the mother of bharata with extremely powerful words that hunchback again made these utterances beneficial to bharata and detrimental to rama
it is true that if rama secures this kingdom you along with your son are bound to suffer o auspicious one hence act in a way your son bharata will be installed
repeatedly struck down by that hunchbacks arrowsharp words greatly grieved queen kaikeyi was inflamed against the king laying her hands on the chest again and again and expressing her amazement she praised that hunchback
tell the king that he will see either the fulfilment of bharatas desire after rama is banished into the forest for a long period or me gone to yamas abode
if rama does not go from here to the forest i want neither a bed nor garlands nor sandalpaste nor unguents nor food nor water nor even life
saying these ruthless words that lovely kaikeyi cast off all her ornaments like a fallen kinnara woman and lay down on the floor with the carpet removed
thus queen kaikeyis face enveloped by the darkness of violent anger and her body stripped of all valuable ornaments she lay restless looking like the dark sky without stars      thus ends of the ninth sarga of ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
perversely advised by the extremely sinful hunchback the queen kaikeyi lay down on the ground like a kinnari struck as though by a poisonous arrow
the intelligent beautiful lady kaikeyi having correctly decided the strategy in her mind slowly unfolded everything to manthara
that beautiful wretch kaikeyi impressed by the words of manthara heaved deep hot sighs like a female serpent and thought for a while about the means of bringing happiness to herself
manthara kaikeyis friend too driven by a strong desire to fulfil her resolve was highly pleased and on hearing the firm determination of kaikeyi felt as if the accomplishment of the objective was at hand
then kaikeyi finally took a firm decision with a soiled body and a frowning face she lay down on the floor
thereafter kaikeyi flung away her multicoloured garlands along with her costly ornaments on to the ground
all the garlands and ornaments she scattered adorned the floor like the stars illumining the sky
tightly fastening her hair into a single braid and wearing soiled clothes she lay down in the chamber of wrath in a lifeless state like a kinnari
the king issued orders for ramas installation ceremony and taking leave of his close associates entered the palace
aware of the fact that ramas installation ceremony was known to everybody by then he who had subdued his senses entered the inner apartment to convey it to one worthy of such pleasant news
the illustrious king entered the excellent abode of kaikeyi like the moon entering the mouth of rahu in a sky overcast with pale clouds
the maharaja entered the inner apartment of kaikeyis prosperous abode filled with parrots and peacocks reverberating with cries of kraunchas and swans and sounds of musical instruments attended with hunchbacks and dwarfs decorated with champak and ashoka trees bowers surrounded with creepers picturegalleries altars and sofas embellished with ivory gold and silver it was shining with pools and trees bearing flowers and fruits in all seasons various kinds of food drinks and eatables were kept ready with excellent decorations that abode of kaikeyi resembled heaven but the king did not see his beloved kaikeyi in her best bed
charged with passion and seeking carnal pleasure the king became dejected when he did not see his beloved wife he enquired about her
never before had queen kaikeyi missed his time of arrival nor had the king ever entered her empty apartment
having entered her apartment the king unaware of that foolish kaikeyis selfish design enquired her whereabouts as usual
thereafter the frightened doorkeeper with folded palms said o monarch the queen in a hot mood has rushed into the chamber of wrath
hearing the words of the doorkeeper the melancholic king grieved all the more with his senses agitated and unstable
the lord of the earth dasaratha saw her kaikeyi lying down on the floor of the chamber of wrath in an unbecoming manner and felt as if consumed by grief
the guileless old king beheld his youthful wife who was dearer to him than his own life filled with deceitful intentions she looked like a severed creeper like a goddess fallen down like a kinnari thrown down on earth like an apsarasa slipped from heaven like an illusion torn like a female deer tied down
like a mighty sheelephant caressing her cow wounded with a poisoned arrow in the forest he caressed her lovingly
with a mind extremely terrified yet passionate he caressed his lotuseyed wife with his hands and said
o auspicious queen i do not know whether your anger is directed at me i do not know the cause of your anger by whom have you been offended or disrespected why are you lying in the dust this is causing me great sorrow
while i am here favourably disposed towards you why are you lying down on the floor like one possessed by an evil spirit why are you afflicting my mind
o lovely one there are to my best satisfaction expert physicians in all branches of medical science they will restore your health tell me your ailment
on whom do you wish to bestow favour who has caused you displeasure to whom should i grant favour now to whom should i cause great displeasure
o queen shed no tears drain not your health ask me and i shall slay one who should not be slain or release one who should be slain i shall make a poor man rich and a wealthy man poor tell me who are such people
my kins and i are under your control i will make no effort to go even a little against your wishes
if you want to do anything even if it means sacrificing my life i shall do it since you know my strength it does not behove you to doubt me i swear on my merits i will do whatever pleases you
my authority on the land is extended till such places the wheel of any chariot rotates such as the regions in the east sindhusauvira areas saurashtra southern regions banga anga magadha states matsya kingdom and kasikosala countries which are prosperous places
there wealth and foodgrains sheep and goats and many things are produced o kaikeyi ask whichever of these you wish
o lady why do you exert yourself arise arise o charming kaikeyi tell me the cause of your fear i will dispel it just as the sun dispels morning mists
thus spoken to she kaikeyi breathed a sigh of relief intending to tell him the unpleasant thing which was in her mind she began tormenting her husband all the more     thus ends the tenth sarga of ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
to the ruler of the earth the king struck by the darts of kamadeva and overtaken by passion kaikeyi spoke these dreadful words
o king i have neither been offended nor disregarded by any one but i have a purpose which you should fulfil
if you are inclined to accomplish my desire then promise me that you will fulfil them thereafter i shall reveal it to you
the mighty king steeped in passion gently held kaikeyis hair in his hands and with a clear bright smile said
o proud lady dont you know there exists for me no woman dearer than you and no man other than rama who is the best among men
i swear in the name of the scion of the raghu dynasty the invincible broadminded rama the best among men worthy of long life tell me what you have in mind
o kaikeyi in the name of rama without seeing whom i for sure cannot live a momment i swear i will fulfil your desire
o kaikeyi i wish the best among men rama welleven at the expense of my life or the lives of the rest of my sons i swear in his name i shall fulfil your wish
o gentle lady my heart is sinking touch my heart and deliver me from distress o kaikeyi considering all this tell me what you think is good
you know fully the authority you wield over me therefore it does not behove you to doubt me i swear on my acquired merits that i shall do whatever pleases you
bent upon her interests the queen cheered and expressed in unutterable words her premeditated wish which had no alternative
delighted by the words of the king kaikeyi disclosed him her highly dreadful wish which entered her mind like a sudden visitation of death
you are repeatedly swearing to grant me boons let the thirtythree crore gods headed by the firegod listen
let the moon and the sun the sky the planets night and day the ten quarters the world gandharvas rakshasas this earth the nocturnal spirits all beings family deities of every house and all other beings listen to your words of promise
king dasaratha who is true to his vows heroic and knows the ways of righteousness is granting me boons with a wellcomposed mind let all the gods stand witness to this declared kaikeyi
clasping the great archer the infatuated king conferer of boons and flattering him to the top of her bent the queen said
o king recall the event that happened long ago in the war between gods and asuras where the enemy destroyed all your forces except your life
o king i rescued you there since i was alert to protect you you granted me two boons
o protector of the earth o king honest in keeping promises i now seek those two boons which were reserved as deposits
the boons you have vowed to give shall rightfully be given to me if not disgraced by you i shall give up my life right away
the king now came under the control of kaikeyi by his own words like a deer that jumps into the trap for its own destruction
thereafter she said to the infatuated king who had promised to confer her boons o lord of the earth o king right now i shall speak to you about the two boons granted by you listen to my words
preparations for ramas consecration have been made with these very materials for installation my son bharata should be consecrated
then in the war between gods and asuras o lord pleased with me you have promised a second boon and the time has come to grant it
consigned to the dandaka forest for fourteen years clad in bark and deer skin and wearing matted hair rama shall live like an ascetic
let bharata be princeregent without any rivals this is my great desire i am asking for an already granted boon let me see ramas departure to the forest today itself
o king of kings by being true to your vow protect your race character and lineage those sages whose ascetism is their wealth maintain that there is no merit superior to truthfulness which can confer man a place in the other world     thus ends the eleventh sarga of ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
after hearing the dreadful words of kaikeyi the maharaja dasaratha engulfed in grief was extremely distressed for a moment
is this a dream or a hallucination of the mind or some foreboding evil i am going to experience or a malady of my mind wondered dasaratha
the king absorbed in such thoughts did not get solace he was startled and distressed like a deer beholding a tigress he had long lost the senses struck by the ruthless words of kaikeyi he sank down upon the bare floor heaving deep sighs like a venomous serpent lying confined in a circle what a pity said the king with indignation and with his senses overwhelmed by sorrow fell into a stupor again
regaining his consciousness after a long time the king in deep grief and with eyes as though burning in anger looked at kaikeyi and said
o woman of cruel and sinful nature you are bent on destroying this family what harm has been done to you by rama or by me
then rama was conducting himself in relation to you as his own mother for what purpose are you seeking injustice to such a person
in my ignorance i brought home for my selfdestruction a kings daughter who was like a venomous female serpent
when all living beings of this world are extoling the virtues of rama for what crime should i abandon my beloved son
i shall give up kausalya or sumitra or all my wealth or even my own life but i cannot leave rama who is devoted to his father
when i see my firstborn i experience supreme delight but if i do not see him my life loses its meaning
this world can exist without the sun or crops can be grown without water but without rama life would not exist in my body
o lady of evil intentions enough of this give up your resolve here i touch your feet with my head be pleased with me
o sinful one why have you got this most dreadful thought do you want to know my likes or dislikes about bharata let them be sobut speaking of rama earlier you used to say rama is my eldest son he is noble and foremost in discharging his duties such sweet words could not have been said only to please me
further you are tormented with sorrow under the influence of others insinuations you are causing me great pain by entering the empty chamber of wrath
o queen till now you had a moral sense with your mind debased now a very great immorality has infected the ikshvaku race
o largeeyed lady you have never done anything improper or unpalatable towards me in the past therefore i do not believe your words
o childish one you used to tell me several times that rama is as dear to you as the highsouled bharata
o lady how do you wish this righteous and illustrious rama to dwell in the forest for fourteen years
why do you want rama who is so tender and a firm follower of dharma to dwell in the highly dreadful forest
o woman with attractive eyes why do you want rama who is so charming and serving you to be exiled to a distant place
rama is doing greater service to you than bharata therefore i do not find any reason for you to have a special love for bharata
there are many thousands of women and attendants in the inner apartment but who will do greater service and honour you more than rama the best among men in the execution of your orders
the best among men rama has won the trust of the inhabitants of the country by securing their affection with a pure heart and by doing acts dear to them therefore neither a word of blame nor reproach applies to this scion of the raghu dynasty rama
rama is a hero who wins over the people by his truthfulness the poor by charity the preceptors by his service and the enemies in the battle by the power of his bow
truth munificence asceticism renunciation purity uprightness learning and service to his superiors all those virtues are firmly planted in this descendant of the raghus
how do you o devi wish to harm rama who is endowed with uprightness who resembles the gods and in lustre to great ascetics
how can i for your sake speak harsh to my beloved rama who uses pleasing words to the people of the world and never an unpleasant word which i can recall
where is the refuge for me without him in whom dwell forgiveness forbearance renunciation truthfulness righteousness gratefulness and also nonviolence towards all living beings
o kaikeyi you should show mercy to this wretched old man on the verge of death wailing pitifully
i shall give you all that can be secured on this earth bounded by the ocean show no anger
o kaikeyi i bow to you with folded palms i touch your feet too be the saviour of rama let no sin taint me here in this life
then the fierce kaikeyi used fiercer words in reply to the king who was tormented with grief and filled with tears senses switched off head reeling overwhelmed with pain beseeching again and again to ferry him across the ocean of sorrow as quickly as possible
o valiant king if you repent like this after having given two boons how will you talk about your righteousness on this earth
o knower of righteousness when innumerable rajarshis assemble and ask you on this what answer will you give
will you say to such a kaikeyi by whose mercy i am alive and by whom i was protected i have broken the promise given
o king right now having given two boons you are speaking otherwise you are bringing blemish to kings of the ikshwaku race
king saibya gave his own flesh to the hawk in the conflict between the hawk and the pigeon king alarka gave his eyes to a blind man and attained the highest state
having made the vow to the gods the ocean does not advance beyond the shore recollect the history of the earlier kings and do not make the vow false
o wickedminded one deserting righteousness and installing rama in the kingdom you want to enjoy life with kausalya everafter
whether righteous or unrighteous true or false there is no deviation from what you have promised to me
if rama is coronated i will die while as you are watching right in your presence today itself by drinking excessive poison
if i were to see ramas mother receiving homage from everybody even for a day i shall prefer my death
o king i swear on bharata and on my own life that nothing less than ramas banishment will satisfy me
kaikeyi having spoken to this extent remained silent she heeded not the lament of the king
having heard of the highly unfair demands by kaikeyi for ramas exile to the forest and bharatas prosperity enthronement the king was dumbstruck for a while with his senses agitated he did not speak to kaikeyi
the unhappy king intently fixed his gaze at his beloved queen speaking unpleasant words charged with grief and anguish unpleasant to the heart like the dreadful thunderbolt
reflecting on the determination of the queen and her dreadful vow the king sighed and cried o rama and then fell down like a tree severed
the lord of the earth dasaratha became like a man with the mind deranged like a sick man behaving to the contrary like a serpent with its energy drained through mantra
the king addressed kaikeyi in humble words saying why did you exhibit this unfortunate act apparently beneficial to you you are not ashamed of saying this like one whose faculties are possessed by an evil spirit
i never knew earlier when you were young that you possessed such perverse behaviour but now i perceive the reverse of what i knew
you are asking for a boon that bharata should be enthroned in the kingdom while rama should live in the forest from where did you get this apprehension
if you wish to do good to your husband to the world and also to bharata refrain from this illusory thought
o cruel one o woman of sinful resolve o vile creature o woman of evil deeds what wrong or sin do you really see in rama or in me
depriving rama bharata in no way will occupy the kingdom because in the matter of righteousness i think he is superior even to rama
while instructing rama to go to the forest how can i look at his face pale like the eclipsed moon
i have taken this decision in consultation with friends to install rama how can i see such a decision being reversed like a retreating army defeated by enemies kings from different quarters have already arrived and they will say how did this ignorant descendant of the ikshakus dasaratha rule this kingdom for such a long time
when several virtuous and learned elders ask me about rama what shall i tell them
if i tell the truth tortured by kaikeyi i have sent rama to the forest none will believe it and they will consider it untruth
if rama takes refuge in the forest what will kausalya say to me having committed such an unpleasant act what reply can i give her
sweetspoken kausalya who always cherishes my welfare who has given me my beloved son who has served me like an attendant a friend a wife a sister and a mother deserved courteous treatment from me but because of you she never received due attention from me
i have done many favours to you like a sick person afflicted by eating rice mixed with unwholesome curry those acts of kindness are burning me now
in seeing the insult meted out to rama and his journey to the forest how will frightened sumitra have confidence in me
alas sita will listen in a pitiable state the two unpleasant events namely my death and ramas exile to the foest
what a pity vaidehi lamenting like a kinnari forsaken by a kinnara on the himalayan slopes will cause death to me
with rama living in the wilderness and sita crying i do not hope to survive for long indeed
o devi you will certainly rule the kingdom as a widow along with your son but i do not wish to live after rama is exiled
like people regarding wine mixed with poison as fine before drinking it i had a firm belief that you were a chaste woman but while you who look extremely beautiful you are actually not so
you used to console me with so many words pleasing but untrue and you killed me like a hunter getting the deer trapped and slaughtered through the melody of music
respectable people on the highway will certainly say he sold away his son and censure me as a mean person like a brahmin consuming liquor
what suffering what a calamity that i am made to put up with your words i am subject to this suffering may be as expiation for the sin formerly committed
o wretch i protected you in my folly for a long time through ignorance like a rope preserved which turned out to be a noose to hang me with
while sporting with you i did not realize you were death incarnate like a child handling a black cobra i caressed you
wicked i am i have made that magnanimous rama fatherless this world of living beings is certainly entitled to condemn me
they will say alas how utterly foolish and lustful is king dasaratha who is sending his beloved son to the forest for the sake of a woman
rama already emaciated by observing vows related to ritual and celibacy in compliance with the orders of the preceptors has to undergo hardships again at a time when he should enjoy pleasures of life
my son rama will not say a second word to me if i tell him go to the foresthe will say certainly so
if this scion of the raghu race rama urged to go to the forest acts against my order it will be welcome but my son will not do it
the descendant of the raghus rama who is pure in thought will not come to know my intention therefore if i tell him go to the forest he will say certainly so
if rama goes to the forest the god of death will conduct me to his abode for condemned by the entire world i shall not be forgiven even by yama
with me dead and rama the best among men banished what harmful acts are you contemplating against my wellwishers
if queen kausalya loses me rama lakshmana and satrughna will follow me into death unable to bear the grief
o kaikeyi consign kausalya sumitra me and my three sons into hell and be happy
you will rule undisturbed the ikshvaku race honoured for its divine virtues now abandoned by me and rama it will be afflicted with grief
if ramas exile is approved by bharata then let him not perform my funeral rites after my death
o my enemy o wicked kaikeyi after rama the foremost of men has left for the forest your desires will be fulfilled and after my death you as a widow along with your son will rule the kingdom
you lived in my palace under the name of a princess you have brought me for sure unparalleled dishonour and disgrace everybody will look upon me with contempt as if i have committed a sinful act
how will my son rama who used to ride on chariots elephants and horses roam the wilderness barefoot
how will my son for whom the cooks with kundalas in their ears used to proudly prepare enough food and beverages subsist on astringent pungent bitter wild fruits and roots
how will he who was habituated to wearing expensive apparels and to royal comforts over a long period of time live sleep on the ground putting on saffron robes
whose are these dreadful words this inconceivable plan of ramas exilement and bharatas enthronement
a woman means one who secretly harms others this is shameful indeed they always seek selfish interests i do not say this of all women only of bharatas mother
o malicious one o covetous one o cruel one o woman determined to torment me what fault have you seen in rama who is always devoted to the welfare of others
this entire world will be inflamed to see rama plunged in adversity fathers will abandon their sons wives attached to their husbands will forsake them
when i see my son handsome and welladorned like the son of a celestial deity coming towards me i rejoice even his very sight makes me grow young again
natures activity will continue even without the sun or even if indra wielder of the thunderbolt sends no rain but none will live to see rama departing to the forest this is my conviction
alas i carried all along on my lap a highly poisonous female snake i gave you shelter while you were like death this delusion is the cause of my ruinyou were my enemy you wished me harm you wished my destruction
with rama and lakshmana withdrawn from me my kinsmen killed let bharata along with you rule the city and the kingdom causing delight to my enemies
o cruelhearted woman you strike one in adversity why are your teeth with which you are now speaking such harsh words do not fall to the ground broken into a thousand fragments
how do you find fault with rama who does not utter even one harmful or unpalatable word who does not know how to use harsh words and who speaks pleasingly and who is always honoured for his virtues
o obloquy on the house of kekaya you may grieve or burn yourself in the fire or get destroyed even if you fall down on earth broken into a thousand pieces i will not act on your terrible harmful words
there is no life for me without my son rama what to speak of happiness again where is pleasure for a selfrespecting man like me o queen it does not behove you to do this harmful act i will touch your feet show pity on me
the king with his heart in the grip of a woman wailing like an orphan tried to reach her feet exceeding the limit of selfrespect but unable to touch them as she pulled them apart he collapsed like a sick man     thus ends the twelfth sarga of ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
the maharaja lying on the floor resembled king yayati fallen from heaven after his merits earned earlier were exhausted he neither deserved nor was accustomed to such humiliating treatment fearless kaikeyi the incarnate of misfortune having accomplished her purpose displyaing feigned fear urged the king again without inhibition about the boons
o great king you used to boast that you always speak the truth and are steadfast in your vows why are you now seeking to avoid granting me this boon
thus addressed by kaikeyi king dasaratha flew into a temper for a while and then as if in a state of delirium replied
alas o ignoble woman my enemy your desire would be fulfilled after rama the foremost among men is exiled and i am dead you will be happy thereafter
even in heaven when the gods enquire about the welfare of rama how will i convince them about his banishment repudiating the fact what a catastrophe
if i tell the truth to please kaikeyi i have sent rama to the forest none will believe it and will consider it untruth
when i was issueless i obtained mighty and valiant rama with great effort as a son how can i banish him
how can i exile rama whose eyes resemble lotus petals who is learned who has subdued his anger and who is always full of forgiveness
rama with a charming personality has a complexion like the blue lotus he has long arms with immense strength how can i banish him to dandaka forest
rama deserves happiness not suffering how can i bear to see such a sagacious rama undergoing distress
if death comes to me right now i shall be very happy because i will not have to inflict suffering on rama who does not deserve it
o cruel malevolent kaikeyi why do you propose such a harmful act against rama who has truth as his prowess and who is so dear to me certainly you will get unparalleled infamy and disgrace in this world
while dasaratha was thus lamenting with a distracted mind the sun set and night fell
for the king who was in deep anguish and in tears the night appeared dark even though it was adorned with the lunar orb
the old king dasaratha heaving hot sighs started lamenting pitiably fixing his gaze at the sky like the sick
o auspiciouslooking night adorned with stars i do not wish to see the dawn o gentle night be kind to me i pray with folded hands
or pass off quickly i do not want to see this merciless malicious kaikeyi who is the cause of this great misfortune
having said this the king spoke again with folded hands to kaikeyi in order to appease her
o lady with fair hips i hope whatever i have said has not been a cry in the empty sky o young lady show me this favour surely you are kindhearted
o queen with beautiful dark eyelashes show pity on me let rama receive this unbounded kingdom through you and you acquire fame
o lady with heavy hips charming eyes and a beautiful face do this favour to me to rama to the world to all the preceptors and to bharata too
the king with a clean heart whose eyes had been rendered red with weeping wailed piteously even after hearing it that malicious woman full of wicked thoughts did not act upon his word
seeing his dear wife not pleased despite his pleadings and urging him to the contrary for the banishment of his son the king overcome with grief fell down unconscious on the floor
the night passed off with the highminded king lamenting this way and heaving deep sighs when he got up the eminent king stopped the panegyrists awakening him     thus ends the thirteenth sarga of ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
the evil woman kaikeyi said to the king of the ikshvaku race who lay unconscious on the floor writhing and tormented with grief on account of his son
kaikeyi said what is this after hearing my response to the promised boon why are you lying down on the floor dejected as if you had committed a sin it behoves you to maintain your status
those conversant with righteousness say that truth is a great virtue by following the truth i have enlightened you about your duty
o king o lord of the earth king saibya attained the highest state by offering his own body to a hawk in accordance with his promise
in the same way the lustrous king alarka on being solicited by a brahmin who was an adept in the vedas plucked his own eyes and gave them to him without hesitation
the ocean lord of rivers even when tidal time comes does not cross the shore in obedience to truth
truth is brahman in one word righteousness is firmly established in truth truth is the imperishable vedas the supreme state can be attained by means of truth
o excellent one if your mind is firmly fixed in righteousness then by following it fulfil the boon granted to meyou are the bestower of boons indeed
you must uphold righteousness i also urge you to do that send your son rama to the forest i am repeating this statememt thrice
o noble one if you do not fulfil the agreement it will mean i have been abandoned by you therefore i will give up my life in your presence
in this way urged by kaikeyi without fear or hesitation he dasaratha like bali unable to release himself from the noose cast by indra through vamana could not get out of the noose of promise
like a bullock restlessly moving between the wheels and the yoke dasarathas heart started beating wildly and his face turned pale
the king was unable to see with his eyes overwhelmed with tears gaining with great difficulty a firm footing and courage he addressed kaikeyi
o wicked woman i held your hand amid chantings of mantras with the sacred fire as witness i now disown that hand you and your son begotten by me
o queen the night has departed and the sun is about to rise the preceptors now will definitely ask me to hasten for the consecration
with the materials already collected for the consecration of rama he will perform my funeral rite of offering water to the dead
o woman of inauspicious practices since you are obstructing ramas coronation you and your son shall not perform my funeral rite of offering water to the dead
having seen people formerly enjoying happiness i cannot see them again with their downcast cheerless faces devoid of all happiness
while the king was thus speaking to her kaikeyi that holy night resplendent with the moon and the stars the day dawned
thereafter kaikeyi of sinful conduct and skilful in the use of words rendered senseless by wrath again addressing the king in harsh words said
o king why are you speaking these painful poisonous words what is this it behoves you to summon your son rama who does not expearience this pain
only after you have installed my son in the kingdom and sent rama to the forest and made me free from rivals you shall have your duty fulfiled
the king who was very much incited by her words like a horse of the best breed whipped by the lash replied to kaikeyi
i am bound by bond of righteousness my intellect is destroyed i wish to see my beloved virtuous firstborn rama
the night dawned ths sun rose the auspicious time with the sacred star in favourable conjunction arrived the virtuous vasistha surrounded by his disciples soon entered the best of abodes with the articles collected for the ceremony
the streets in ayodhya were swept and sprinkled with water decorated with excellent flags strewn with flowers of variegated colours and bedecked with various flower garlands the streets were crowded with curious people rejoicing at the event the stalls and markets were abundantly filled with merchandisethe city was full of great festivities the people were curious to see rama sandalwood and incense were burnt and fragrance pervaded in all the directions the city resembled amaravati the abode of indravasistha entered the city covered some distance and beheld the best inner apartment there he saw host of brahmins citizens and villagers the best of inner apartments was graced with brahmins who were experts in sacrificial rituals priests and eminent brahmins
having reached the inner apartment the eminent ascetic vasistha felt very happy he passed by the people and entered the inner apartment
sage vasistha saw handsome sumantra minister to dasaratha a lion among the charioteers coming out of the gate
effulgent vasistha said to the expert chariotieer sumantra to inform the king immediately of his arrival
here are the pots filled with water from river ganga and golden vessels with water from the seas and throne made of udumbara wood for the installation ceremony all kinds of seeds perfumes different kinds of precious stones honey curd ghee puffed grains kusha grass special grass used in rituals flowers milk eight beautiful girls an intoxicated elephant a dignified chariot drawn by four horses a sword an elegant bow a palanquin accompanied by bearers an umbrella resembling the full moon two white fans made of yaks tails a golden vessel a palecoloured humped bull wearing golden gerland a lion having four strong and large teeth a mighty horse of the best breed a throne tiger skin fire kindled with faggots all kinds of musical instruments courtesans welldecorated women preceptors brahmins cows sacred animals and birds eminent citizens and villagers groups of merchants all speaking pleasant words and kings all are here for ramas coronation

hasten the maharaja as rama has to be installed in the kingdom as soon as the day breaks under the conjunction of the sacred pushya star
having heard the words of the great vasistha charioteer sumantra entered the inner apartment singing the praise of this tiger among kings dasaratha
the doorkeepers beloved wellwishers of the king did not detain aged sumantra who was liked by the king and who had arrived early
sumantra approached the king unaware of the state of his mind and commenced praising him in highly pleasing words as usual
thereafter the charioteer sumantra entered the inner apartment of the king and with folded hands began singing the praise of the lord of the earth appropriate to the hour
just as the mighty ocean rejoices at sunrise the inherently cheerful sumantra became delighted to see the king
just as indras charioteer at this time at dawn extols him the conquerer of demons so do i rouse you with a song
just as the vedas and vedangas awaken the selfborn lord brahma so do i awaken you
as the sun along with the moon awakens the auspicious earth which supports all beings in the same way i am awakening you today
o mighty king get up at once like the sun rising up mount meru put on your beautiful body auspicious robes befitting the festivity
o descendent of kakutstha may moon and sun siva and kubera varuna agni and indra bestow victory on you
o best among kings the holy night has passed having been acquainted with the acts accomplished so far perform whatever is further necessary for the installation ceremony all preparations for ramas coronation ceremony have since been complete
venerable vasistha along with inhabitants of the city and countryside including merchants and brahmins with folded hands awaits you
o king ramas installation may be promptly ordered as herds without herdsman army without commander night without the moon and cows without a bull so is a kingdom without a king
hearing these meaningful words of sumantra uttered in an appealing tone the lord of the earth relapsed into grief
the virtuous and glorious king thinking of his son without cheer looked upward with eyes red with tears and said to the charioteer you are causing my heart excruciating pain with your words
having heard the sorrowful words of the king and having seen his wretched state sumantra with palms folded moved away a little from the place
when the king himself in that wretched state was not able to speak to sumantra crafty kaikeyi said to him in reply
o sumantra excited with joy on account of the proposed installation of rama the king did not have a wink of sleep all night he is weary and overpowered with sleep
so o sumantra quickly fetch the gentle illustrious prince rama let there be no hesitation in this matter
thinking that an auspicious event will take place he rejoiced at heart and in obedience to royal order left at once
urged by kaikeyi sumantra thought righteous rama will definitely come here for the purpose of installation
so thought the charioteer and filled with great delight left the inner apartment eager to see the mightyarmed rama
sumantra departed from the auspcious inner apartment which looked like the deep waters of the sea and saw people thronging the gate
then sumantra hastened towards the gate where he saw kings wealthy people and citizens who had already arrived and waiting there      thus ends the fourteenth sarga of ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
the brahmins wellversed in the vedas stayed waiting all night and assembled at the pavilion for the consecration ceremony along with royal priests
for the consecration of the scion of the raghu race rama ministers army chiefs and chiefs of merchants associations assembled brimming with joy
the best of brahmins had decided to perform the consecration ceremony after the bright sun appeared in the sky when the pushya star approached the karkataka lagna which was the constellation at the time of ramas birth
water had been fetched from the sacred confluence of ganga and yamuna from other holy streams wells ponds and lakes from rivers flowing eastward westward and zigzag from rivers from all directions joined together and from all the seas
gold and silver vessels filled with holy water and puffed corn adorned with lotuses water lilies and leaves from trees rich in sap shone
honey curd ghee puffed grain darbha grass flowers and milk were arranged wellmannered courtesans adorned with all kinds of ornaments stood in position
an excellent fan of yaks tail with a staff of gold studded with gems looking like diffused moonbeams was kept ready
a lustrous pale white umbrella resembling the moons orb or the pole star was kept in front of the coronation pavilion
a bull and a horse both pale white and a majestic elephant in rut worthy of royal ride stood waiting
eight auspicious maidens adorned with all types of ornaments all sorts of musical instruments panegyrists and others were in waiting
just as articles necessary for the consecration of the descendants of the ikshvakus are customarily arranged in the kingdom in the same way things were arranged for the coronation of the prince belonging to that race all those who had assembled there in response to the order of the king could not see him and so they said to themselves who will inform the king of our arrival everything is kept ready for consecration of the sagacious rama as prince regent the sun has risen but we do not find the king
while the sovereign monarchs who hailed from different parts of the earth were thus talking sumantra the kings confidant said
in obedience to the kings command i am hurrying for rama all of you are honourable to king dasaratha especially to rama
on your behalf i shall enquire from the king who is awake now about his welfare and the reason for calling me here
having said so sumantra who was versed in history and tradition approached the inner apartment which always remains closed
entering the kings inner apartment he began extoling the virtues of the royal dynasty and stood there as he approached the kings bedchamber
having approached the kings bedchamber sumatra stood behind the screen singing his glory and seeking the blessings of god on this son of raghus dynasty
o scion of the kakutsthas dasaratha may moon and sun siva and kubera varuna agni and indra grant you victory
the holy night has passed and the auspicious day has arrived o tiger among kings awaken and attend to your duties
o scion of the raghu dynasty brahmins army commanders and merchants have arrived and they beseech your audience please awake
dasaratha waking up saw the charioteer and expert counsellor sumantra extoling him and said
you had been asked by her kaikeyi to bring rama here what is the reason the command is disregarded
i did not sleep last night bring rama here at once said king dasaratha to the charioteer again
at these words of the king he offered his salutations by bowing his head and left the kings apartment reflecting on the great happy event
the charioteer left cheerfully happily looking at the highway bedecked with pennants and banners
the charioteer heard the conversation relating to rama and his consecration among the happy citizens
thereafter sumantra beheld the beautiful palace of rama resembling the abode of indra or the peak of kailasa in its splendour
the charioteer sumantra beheld ramas palace closed with two heavypanelled doors adorned with hundreds of galleries it had a peak mounted with golden idols the arches were studded with different gems and corals bright like dense autumnal cloud it shone like the cave of mount meru it was ornamented with excellent garlands and precious diamonds pearls were strewn around decorated with sandal and aloe wood it emitted like the peak of mount dardura captivating fragrance sarasas and peacocks were singing sweetly the palace was full of skilfully carved images of deer and other embellishments it attracted the minds and the eyes of all living beings with brilliant splendour resplendent like the sun and the moon it looked like the abode of kubera and a reflected image of the abode of mahendra it was crowded with birds of various kinds in height it was equal to the peak of mount meru villagers thronged the palace with gifts eagerly waiting with folded hands to see the spectacle of ramas coronation lofty it looked like a vast cloud welldecked and filled with various gems it was crowded with hunchbacks and kiratas hunters too

mounted on a chariot attached with a fender and driven by horses the charioteer advanced towards the royal palace of rama delighting the minds of the people of the city
having reached the palace abounding in deer and peacocks which resembled the magnificent and opulent abode of indra the charioteer was thrilled at the allpervading beauty of the place befitting rama
having entered the welldecorated palace which was lofty like kailasa he crossed the courtyards comparable to the abode of the celestials passed through the many bosom friends of rama and entered the private apartment
there he heard the happy words spoken by people about the enthronement of prince rama and his future wellbeing
sumantra beheld ramas palace which resembled the high summit of mount meru shining with splendour filled with animals and birds if looked like the abode of indra
he saw villagers and others in crores and parardhas leaving their chariots and thronging the gateway some paying obeisance with folded palms and some carrying gifts in their hands
he beheld a beautiful elephant named satrunjaya with a huge body on which rama was to mount it looked like a vast mountain or a huge cloud with ichor flowing from his temples and without caring for the goad the elephant was intolerant
important ministers who were dear to the king and welladorned arrived there on their horses chariots and elephants sumantra finding his way through the crowd of the people who assembled on all sides entered the glorious private apartment of rama
the palace looked like a mountain peak covered by a cloud and a great vimana surrounded by splendid apartments the charioteer entered the palace unobstructed like a crocodile entering the ocean bristling with many gems     thus ends the fifteenth sarga of ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
sumantra who was conversant with ancient traditions passed through the entrance of the inner apartment full of people and reached the sparsely crowded courtyard there alert loyal young men were attentively guarding the frontyard armed with spears and bows and wearing shining earrings
he saw aged people appointed as security staff for womens apartments they were welladorned dressed in orange robes and with rapt attention stood holding staff in their hands
on seeing sumantra arriving all of them wellwishers to rama quickly rose from their seats
humble and extremely courteous charioteer to the guards said inform rama at once that sumantra is waiting at the entrance
always dedicated to the wellbeing of their master they approached rama who was in the company of sita and informed him
coming to know that sumantra who is intimate to his father had arrived rama in order to please him commanded that he be escorted to that very place
sumantra beheld rama who resembled kubera rama was sitting on a richlycovered golden couch welladorned and anointed with precious pure fragrant red sandalpaste the colour of which appeared like the blood of a hog with sita standing by his side with a fan of yaks tail in her hand rama the tormentor of foes looked like the moon united with the star chitra
sumantra who knew the art of modesty made humble reverential salutation to rama the granter of boons shining like the sun with his own effulgence
on seeing rama of charming countenance relaxing on a couch sumantra honourable to the king dasaratha said these words with folded palms
o rama worthy son of kausalya your father along with queen kaikeyi desires to see youyou may go there please do not delay
highly lustrous rama the lion among men when thus spoken to was immensely pleased and extending due honour to him said to sita
o sita i am sure the king and queen are discussing something relating to my consecration
my mother daughter of the king of kekaya knows the kings intention and heppy to do me good seeks my wellbeing
it is our fortune that the king and his dear queen have sent sumantra as messenger who is interested in my prosperity and pleasure
there worthy of the council of the king and the queen a befitting messenger has come assuredly the king will consecrate me as heirapparent this very day
i shall go from here immediately and see the king remain here happily and rejoice with your maids
reflecting over the auspicious event the darkeyed sita who is highly esteemed by her husband followed him up to the entrance saying
the king will bestow upon you like the creator of the world brahma bestowing on indra the kingdom served by brahmins who are fit to perform rajasuya sacrifice at the time of consecration
i shall be delighted to see you initiated and engaged in the observance of the vow made pure wearing excellent deerskin and carrying the horns of an antelope in your hand
may indra protect you on the east yama in the south varuna in the west and kubera in the north
adorned in auspicious ornaments rama took leave of sita and departed from his palace accompanied by sumantra
like a lion living in a mountain cave and coming out of it rama while exiting saw lakshmana at the entrance bowing with folded hands
rama the best among men met all his friends in the middle courtyard having seen them all eager to see him he approached and greeted them thereafter he mounted the best silver chariot covered with tigerskin and glowing like fire
the sound emanating from the chariot resembled the thunder the spacious chariot was decorated with gold and gems which dazzled the eyes as though they shed the lustre of the sun the swiftmoving chariot was harnessed by excellent horses as if they were young elephants like the thousandeyed indra rama ablaze with royal splendour mounted this chariot and sped away
the magnificent chariot rumbling like a stormcloud in the sky emerged from ramas residence like the moon peeping through a huge cloud
holding an umbrella and a fan made of yaks tail in his hand lakshmana boarded the chariot at the rear guarding his brother
as it the chariot was passing out a tumultuoas roar emanated from the multitude of people all around
then the chief commanders riding the best of the horses and elephants resembling hills in size followed rama in their hundreds and thousands
soldiers anointing their bodies with pastes of sandal and aloe wood equipped with armour and holding swords and bows went ahead heralding his ramas arrival
at that time sounds of musical instruments and songs of eulogy by panegyrists roarings of warriors were heard on the way
rama the subduer of enemies proceeded while the wellattired women standing at the windows of their mansions showered heaps of flowers on him from every side
women with faultless limbs standing on their housetops as well as on the ground paid their homage with charming words in order to propitiate rama
o joy of your mother rama on seeing you having successfully acomplished the purpose of your journey life by securing your fathers kingdom your mother kausalya will surely be delighted
those women considered sita who was dear to the heart of rama the best among all women
sita was united with rama like rohini with the moon surely because of her great austerities performed in the past they observed
rama the best among men while riding along the highway overheard the pleasing words uttered by women standing on the elevation of their buildings thus hearing his own praise rama proceeded along the highway
rama heard these various words of admiration by people who had assembled there and witnessed the rejoicings of the citizens
this scion of the raghus rama is going to acquire the earth and the wealth today by the kings grace he will be our protector and fulfil all our desires
if this rama obtains the entire kingdom for a long time it will be in the interest of the people if he becomes king none will ever witness anything unpleasant or sad they observed
with bards panegyrists and great musical performers invoking blessings and walking ahead he rama proceeded like kubera amid intoxicated elephants and horses
surrounded by friends overwhelmed with great joy that glorious rama aboard the chariot beheld the city decorated with banners and pennants and made fragrant with expensive incense and agaru and crowded with multitudes of people
that rama proceeded down the middle of the highway made fragrant with agaru and incense lined with houses gleaming pale white like clouds
the highway rama entered was splendid and spacious with heaps of sandal and agaru of the highest quality excellent fragrant substances and bundles of white silken cloth it gleamed with unholed pristine pearls articles made of crystals flowers of every kind and articles of food of every variety
rama beheld the highway resembling the pathway of gods in heaven here the crossroads were always worshipped with curd grains of rice sacrificial libations laja or puffed rice fragrant substances like sandal wood agaru and garlands of every kind
hearing many words of blessings uttered by his friends and honouring each person according to his rank he passed on
they said consecrated today rule the kingdom by adopting the same path followed by your grandfathers and greatgrandfathers
once rama assumes kingship we shall all live in happiness greater than when we were ruled by his father and grandfather
if only we can see rama enthroned today and going in a procession there will be no need for food and no greater object of life to be accomplished
for us there is nothing dearer in the kingdom than the consecration of rama of undimmed brilliance
indifferent to such warm words by his friends in his favour rama passed along the highway
even though rama the best among men had driven past them none was able to withdraw his mind or eyes from him they continued
whoever does not see rama or rama does not see him will be blamed by all men in the three worlds even his self will blame him
that righteous rama shows compassion to all to the four castes to the young and the old so they were devoted to him
the son of the king proceeded leaving on his right squares intersections of four roads and roads leading to temples monuments and shrines too
that prince rama arrived at the excellent palace of the king which looked like the abode of indra on earth blazing with splendour the various towers of the palace touching the sky resembled clusters of white clouds like auspicious peaks of kailasa and like white aerial chariots decorated with gems
rama the best among men crossed the first three courtyards which were protected by bowmen on horses and crossed the remaining two on foot
crossing the courtyards on his way rama sent back his followers and entered the private apartment of the king
when the prince approached his father all the people were delighted and awaited his return like the ocean waiting for the rise of the moon     thus ends the seventeenth sarga of ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
rama beheld his father reclined on an auspicious couch and by his side was seated kaikeyi he looked wretched with a pale face
with all humility and wellcomposed mind he made reverential salutation first at his fathers feet and thereafter at kaikeyis
dasaratha uttered the word rama but thereafter could neither say any more in distress nor look at him becuase his eyes were brimming with tears
never before did rama see such frightful appearance of his father he was seized with fear as if he trampled a serpent
maharaja dasaratha with his senses dulled had become emaciated due to sorrow and suffering with an agitated and troubled mind he was breathing heavily although unshakable he looked agitated like an ocean with successive rows of waves like the sun in eclipse like an ascetic who has uttered falsehood
the more rama reflected on the incomprehensible sorrow of the king the more he became perturbed like an ocean on the new moon day
devoted to his fathers wellbeing rama reflected why does not father reciprocate my greeting like on other days
on other occasions even though angry he would feel pleased but today why does he feel sad even after seeing me
with a sorrowful countenance rama made salutation to kaikeyi and said like a wretch tormented with grief
have i committed any offence unknowingly please tell me why my father is angry with me you alone can pacify him
father has always been affectionate to me but today why is he in a dejected mood why does his countenance look pale and wretched why does he not speak to me
is he suffering from any physical ailment or mental agony it is affliction of either the body or the mind for perpetual happiness is indeed rare
has any misfortune befallen the handsome bharata or the mighty satrughna or any of my mothers
if i have ever displeased the maharaja my father or disobeyed his command which has angered him i do not wish to live for a moment
how can a man who owes his origin birth in this world to him father who still exists as a visible god not conduct himself as per his wish
have you said anything harsh to my father out of anger or injured selfrespect for which his mind has been shaken
o devi i am repeatedly asking you the cause of this unprecedented change in the king please tell me the truth
when kaikeyi was thus asked by the magnanimous scion of the raghus rama she uttered unashamed these impudent words in her own interest
o rama the king is neither angry nor has any misforturne befallen him but out of fear for you he is not able to speak out what he has in mind
the goddess of speech does not permit him to say an unpleasant thing to you for you are his beloved son so you must fulfil the promise he has made to me
in the past the king had honoured me with two boons now like any other common man he is repenting for the same
the king bestowed on me boons saying i shall grant you two boons but now he wishes in vain to build a dam when the water has run down
o rama this truth is the basis of righteousness the virtuous also know this the king being angry with me should not abandon the truth for your sake
if you fulfil whatever the king says pleasant or unpleasant i shall relate to you everything
if you do not transgress the word given by the king i shall tell you everything the king on his own will not tell you
very much depressed on hearing the words of kaikeyi rama thus said to her in the presence of the king
alas what a pity o queen it does not behove you to speak to me such words i can jump into fire since he is my father preceptor and wellwisher i shall consume deadly poison or even get drowned in the sea if he so commands
hence tell me o devi whatever be the desire of the king i promise i shall carry out rama does not say two things does not go back on his word
to rama who was devoted to truth and to rectitude of conduct the ignobale kaikeyi said
o descendant of raghu in the great war between gods and demons in the past your father had granted me two boons for protecting him when he was wounded by a shaft
o scion of the raghus hence i have asked the king for consecration of bharata and your departure to dandaka forest today itself
o the best of men if you want to be true to the word given by you and your father listen to what i say
abide by your fathers command as promised by him go to the forest for fourteen years
bharata shall be consecrated o descendant of the raghu dynasty with all these preparations made by the king to install you
forsake this consecration wear matted locks and deerskin and take refuge in dandaka forest for fourteen years
let bharata live in ayodhya the capital of kosala and rule this kingdom rich in gems of different kinds in horses chariots and elephants
this is why the king with his face tortured by tears and his heart overwhelmed with compassion for you is unable to look at you
o joy of the raghus o son of the raghu race carry out the word of promise given by the king and save him by helping him keep the truth which is great
even though she was speaking harsh words rama did not come to grief but the magnanimous king was greatly afflicted to see the calamity on his son     thus ends the eighteenth sarga of ayodhyakanda of the oly ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
the destroyer of enemies rama did not feel distressed to hear these words painful like death to kaikeyi he said
be it so i shall go from here to the forest and live there with matted hair and deerskin to keep the promise of the king
nevertheless i would like to know why king dasaratha an unassailable subduer of enemies does not greet me as usual
o devi you should not grieve i declare in your presence that i shall go to the forest wearing tattered clothes bark and matted locks rejoice to hear this
ordered by my father who is my wellwisher my guru one with a sense of gratidude and above all a king shall i not without hesitation do what pleases him
one thing which hurts me is that the king himself did not tell me about bharatas consecration that alone is burning my heart
unurged i would have gladly given to bharata the kingdom wealth my most coveted life and even sita
in order to keep the promise i shall do everything to fulfil your desire needless to say that my father has ordered this
please console him why is it that the king with his eyes fixed upon the ground is shedding tears drop by drop
with the kings orders let messengers go right away on swift horses to fetch bharata from his maternal uncles house
as for me without deliberating on the propriety of my fathers orders i shall go from here at once to dandaka forest to live there for fourteen years
kaikeyi happy to hear the words of the son of the raghus as she was convinced that his departure to the forest was certain hastened him to set out
let it be so messengers shall go at once on swift horses to bring bharata from his maternal uncles house
since you are eager to go to the forest i do not think it is proper to delay o rama therefore it behoves you to proceed immediately from here to the forest
out of shame the king is unable to speak to you there is nothing other than this o rama the best of men dispel this distress of mind
o rama as long as you do not hasten to leave this city for the forest your father will neither bathe nor eat
fie what a calamity sighing thus the king overwhelmed with sorrow fainted and fell back on the golden couch
rama lifted up the king and urged by kaikeyi hastened to depart for the forest like a horse flogged by a whip
rama listened to the dreadful cruel words of the ignoble woman but without feeling any sorrow said to kaikeyi these words
o devi i have no desire to live in this world for the sake of wealth know me as one with the sages who are devoted only to righteousness
if i am able to do anything which pleases my venerable father it shall be done in every possible manner may be even at the cost of my life
there is no greater observance of righteousness than doing service to ones father or carrying out his orders
though this has not been said by my respectable father himself i shall live in the forlorn forest for fourteen years in accordance with your word
since in my case you have exercised more authority than my father and pleaded with the king it follows you for sure do not see any virtue in me o kaikeyi or else you should not have asked for bharatas kingship
after taking leave of my mother and consoling sita today itself i shall go to that wild dandaka forest
it is your bounden duty to see that bharata rules the kingdom and serves father
father dasaratha too tormented with grief to speak cried out loudly on hearing the words of rama
effulgent rama bowed at the feet of his father who had fallen into a swoon he bowed at the feet of the ignoble kaikeyi and set out
hardly had rama withdrawn from the harem after circumambulating his father and kaikeyi when he saw his friends
lakshmana the enhancer of sumitras delight with his eyes brimming with tears followed him in a rage
rama circumambulated the vessels meant for the consecration ceremony and steadily glancing at them with attention slowly moved away
rama was the beloved of the people loss of kingdom did not diminish his splendour just like night cannot diminish the splendour of the coolrayed moon
rama was determined to renounce the kingdom and go to the forest so none could see any change in his mind for he was one beyond all worldly affairs
selfpossessed rama held back his sorrow within his mind abandoned the auspicious umbrella welldecorated fans and chariot sent away kinsmen citydwellers and others and entered his mothers residence to break the unpleasant news
all the glorious people around him did not observe any change in the countenance of that dignified and truthful rama
the mightyarmed rama did not leave his habitual cheerfulness like the autumnal moon his own brightness
firmminded and illustrious rama treated all people with sweet words and approached his mother
mighty lakshmana as virtuous as his brother held the sorrow in his mind and followed him
rama entered the palace which was full of great rejoicing he did not disclose the obstruction that had come on the way of achieving his objective for fear of causing distress to his friends      thus ends the nineteenth sarga of ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
when the tiger among men rama was coming out with folded palms there arose a huge cry of distress among the ladies of the harem
rama was the refuge and protector of all the inmates lot of the inner apartment although it was not his duty nor was he forced by his father to safeguard them that rama is now going on exile
rama conducted himself towards us in the same way as he did towards his mother kausalya right from the begining
rama who used to avoid deeds that caused anger pacified those who were angry with him and never lost his cool even when cursed that rama is going on exile today
alas our king who has lost his brain who has ordered the banishment of rama the refuge of all living beings on the other hand is moving about in the world
thus all the queens like calfless cows cried loudly blaming their husband
tormented with grief on account of his son the king sank in his seat on hearing the cries of distress from the inner apartment
deeply pained yet selfpossessed rama heaving sighs like an elephant went towards the inner apartment of his mother along with his brother
rama beheld a highly venerable elderly man seated at the entrance of the residence and many others standing nearby
on seeing rama all the eminent among the victors got up immediately and greeted him saying victory to you
with the first courtyard crossed rama saw in the second aged brahmins versed in the vedas and duly honoured by the king
rama wished the brahmins and saw old men women and children vigilantly guarding the door in the third courtyard
wellpleased the women then greeted him wishing prosperity they hurried into the abode of kausalya and gave her the happy news of ramas arrival
having spent the night with a composed mind abosorbed in meditation kausalya was worshipping lord visnu in the early morning to secure her sons welfare
always engaged in the observance of vows kausalya then clad in silk cloth was performing rituals of auspiciousness offering oblations to the firegod in accordance with mantras vedic hymns
rama entered the auspicious inner apartment of his mother and saw her exhorting the priests to offer sacrificial oblations to agni firegod
there rama saw curd grains of rice clarified butter sweetmeats oblations parched grain white garlands porridge of cooked rice mixed with sesame seeds sacrirficial faggots vessels filled with water etc kept ready for religious rites
kausalya emaciated due to observance of vows and clad in white silk looked like a celestial being she was engaged in offering libations to the deities
seeing her son who had come after a long time and who is a source of joy to his mother kausalya approached him with great delight like a mare to her young calf
the scion of the raghus saw his mother coming and bowed her she held him in both her arms and kissed his forehead
out of love for her son the invincible scion of the raghu dynasty kausalya spoke with gentle and pleasant words
may you attain long life and fame like those of the aged virtuous and great rajarsis who upheld the righteousness in the race
o scion of the raghu race see the king your righteous and truthful father who will consecrate you as princeregent today itself
invited by kausalya to partake the food rama out of abashment only touched the seat provided to him and having stretched his folded palms spoke to his mother
modest by nature rama with respectful humility began seeking her permission for his departure to dandaka forest
o mother surely you do not know that a great misfortune has befallen causing distress to you sita and lakshmana too
i am setting forth to dandaka forest what is this seat for a time has come for me when i am fit for a seat of kusa grass
abstaining from eating meat like hermits and living on honey fruits and roots i am to live in the solitary forest for fourteen years
the great king is conferring the status of heirapparent on bharata while he is banishing me to dandaka forest to live like an ascetic
living on things available in the forest on fruits and roots i am to dwell in the uninhabited jungle for fourteen years
all on a sidden kausalya fell down on the ground like the branch of a sal tree in the forest severed by an axe like a goddess dropped from heaven
seeing his mother who had done nothing to deserve this suffering and who had fallen down like a plantain tree deprived of her senses rama raised her up from the ground
rama gently wiped away the dust that had covered her body as kausalya stood miserable like a mare who stands up after having rolled on the ground while pulling the load
kausalya who deserved happiness yet was struck down by this distress spoke to rama the tiger among men who was sitting nearby while lakshmana was listening
o my son if you were not born to me i even as a woman without progeny would not have experienced grief more intense than this
o my son a barren woman has only one mental agony that she has no progeny except that she does not have any other sorrow
i did not have the fortune o rama to enjoy any auspicious moment or pleasure earlier when my husband was in authority i exist with the hope that i will have it when my son assumes authority
i being the eldest of the queens will have to listen to many heartbreaking and unpleasant words from my fellowwives who are younger to me
there cannnot be greater distress for any woman than such unending grief and lamentation which i am now experiencing
o child even when you are nearby i am neglected like this what to say when you are banished death is certain to me
treating me as an equal or inferior to the attendants of kaikeyi and making me always dependent my husband has greatly suppressed me
any one who serves me or follows me will not talk to me after seeing bharata installed as heirapparent
fallen into an unfortunate state how can i look at kaikeyis face who is always harsh and in temper
o rama i have spent the last seventeen years after your birth with the expectaion that my sorrows would come to an end
therefore o rama i cannot at this old age endure this great endless sorrow and the insults from cowives for long
without beholding your face that is as bright as the full moon how can this wretched woman live this pitiable life
through meditation through fasts and with a great deal of efforts you have been brought up by this luckless mother but alas this is all in vain
i think my heart must be very firm hard like the bark of a great river which touched by a flood of fresh water in the rainy season does not disintegrate
there is no room for me in the abode of yama the god of death if he does not carry me off forcibly like a lion carrying away a crying female deer certainly there is no death for me
surely my still hard heart is made of iron it neither bursts nor breaks down on the ground pervaded by grief there is no untimely death for this my body too
my regret is that all my mortifications gifts of charity and penances are of no avail even the asceticism which i practised for the sake of progeny was fruitless like a seed sown in a barren land
if any one tormented with great sorrow could willingly commit suicide i would have gone the way to the assembly of yama the lord of death right away as without you i will be now like a cow without a calf
what is the use of this life now what is life without you whose countenance glows like the full moon like a cow emaciated by its search for the calf i will follow you into the forest
kausalya filled with anger due to extreme sorrow reflected over her misfortune and burst into harrowing tears looking at rama like a kinnari looking at her grownup son taken captive      thus ends the twentieth sarga of ayodhyakanda of the the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
while ramas mother kausalya was lamenting miserable lakshmana said to her these words appropriate to the occasion
o venerable one i do not like that rama should go to the forest yielding to the words of a woman and renouncing the welfare of the kingdom
the king has a perverse nature he is aged he is overpowered by passions he is under the spell of carnal pleasures and is incited by kaikeyi such a man can speak anything
i do not see any fault in rama nor any offence committed by him for which he is exiled from the kingdom
i do not find anybody in this world even an adversary or one defeated who finds fault with him even in his absence
with no cause nor concern for righteousness will any one abandon his son who is nearly equal to god upright selfrestrained and loved even by his enemies
will any son with the ideals of a king in mind accept such words of this king who has entered his chilhood again
before this news is known to any one bring the kingdom under your control with my assistance
o rama who can commit excesses on you when you stand like yama god of death protected by me with my bow
o best of men if the whole of ayodhya stands against you i shall depopulate it with my sharp arrows
i shall slay all of them who support bharata and those who seek his prosperity a gentleman is treated with disgrace indeed
even if our father instigated by kaikeyi becomes our enemy he shall be imprisoned or even slain regardless of our relationship with him
even a preceptor who follows the unrighteous path and is filled with haughtiness and does not know how to discriminate between good and bad deserves to be disciplined punished
o best of men under what authority or reason this king wants to confer on kaikeyi the kingdom that rightfully belongs to you
what authority o rama chastiser of foes this king has to bestow the kingdom upon bharata by entering into undesirable hostility towards you and me
o mother lakshmana now tells kausalya i am truly loyal to my brother from the bottom of my heart i swear this by my bow on my merits earned through charity by my truthfulness and by the good deeds i have done
o mother rest assured should rama enter a blazing fire or a forest i must have already entered it
like the rising sun dispelling darkness i shall eliminate your sorrow o mother let rama see my valour you too
having heard the words of the magnanimous lakshmana kausalya depressed and weeping said to rama
o my son you have heard what your brother lakshmana said and if it pleases you do later what is to be done
by heeding the unrighteous words of my cowife kaikeyi it does not behove you to leave me griefstricken and go away from here
you are righteous you know your duty if you wish to follow the path of righteousness stay here serve me and follow the best of dharma
o son kasyapa who led a life of selfdiscipline and served his mother at home attained heaven credited with the merit of the highest penance
just as the king is worthy of your respectful homage so am i i will not permit you to go from here to the forest
separated from you i have no use of this life or happiness i prefer to live with you even if it means eating grass
if you depart for the forest leaving me griefstricken i cannot live here i shall seek death by fasting
o son you will then fall into hell as wellknown in the world the ocean the lord of rivers incurred the guilt of slaying a brahmin through unrighteous conduct
thereafter virtuous rama addressed these words consistent with righteousness to his miserable mother kausalya who was thus lamenting
i do not have the power to transgress the orders of my father bowing my head i beseech you allow me to go to the forest
learned sage kandu who knew what is righteousness and a strict observant of vows slew a cow for carrying out the command of his father
earlier the sons of sagara born in our family while excavating the earth by the order of their father met a terrible death
parasurama son of jamadagni himself in obedience to the words of his father decapitated his mother renuka in the forest with an axe
all of them including many other godlike persons o mother fulfilled the words of their father i shall also make my fathers wish come true
i am not o devi the only one obeying my fathers command all i have mentioned to you did
i am not advancing anything new contrary to the existing practice i am only following the trodden path of our ancestors
i will not do as duty anything contrary to what is done by others in this world no one who obeys the commands of his father falls off the path of righteousness
one who is the best among the knowers of speech and best of all archers rama spoke to his mother in this manner and then said to lakshmana
i know o lakshmana your profound affection for me i also know your valour strength and unassailable energy
o lakshamana of auspicious qualities since my mother is not aware of the significance of truth and selfrestraint she is overcome with grief great and incomparable
righteousness alone is supreme in this world and truth is established in righteousness this excellent command of our father is supported by righteousness
any one o hero who has taken recourse to righteousness should not allow the promise made to his father mother or a brahmin to go in vain
o hero i cannot transgress the command of my father since at his instance only kaikeyi urged me to go to the forest
therefore leave this ignoble thought resort to the duty of a kshatriya take the righteous path do not adopt violence follow my decision
speaking affectionately to his brother lakshmana rama with folded hands and head bowed again addressed kausalya
i have decided o mother to go to the forest from here grant me the permission to do so i swear on my life perform all the ceremonies for securing prosperity for me
like rajarshi yayati of yore who lost heaven and rejained it i shall return from the forest to the city of ayodhya after the vow is fulfilled
do not grieve o mother be prudent enough to subdue your sorrow in your heart having fulfilled fathers words i shall come back from my sojourn in the forest
you sita lakshmana sumitra and i all of us shall abide by the words of my father this indeed is eternal law
o mother in withdrawing the articles for consecration and also in subduing the sorrow in your heart approve of my plan to dwell in the forest
having heard these words so unruffled and tranquil which conformed to righteousness mother kausalya like a dead person regaining consciousness spoke to rama again
by virtue of my own duty and affection towards you o my son i am as much your preceptor as your father is i will not grant you permission you should not go leaving me deeply distressed
what is the purpose of my life in this world without you what purpose do i have with the other world or with the oblations offered to manes or with nectar availble to the gods i would prefer one moment in your company to the whole world of living beings without you
at the inconsolable lamentations of his mother rama was in flames within like a mighty elephant prevented from entering the highway by men with fireworks
rama centred on righteousness again addressed his mother who had almost fainted and lakshmana who was deeply distressed as his words were consistent with righteousness he alone was competent to speak that way
i know your devotion to me and your valour o lakshmana but now without understanding my intention you are causing me and mother severe pain and torment
dharmaartha and kama o my dear are adjudged in this world according to the fruits of righteous action all these three are doubtless there in my decision to go to the forest like obedience in a wife and love for the mother in good sons
if actions which combine these three dharma artha and kama cannot be performed which is likely resort to righteousness for one who seeks wealth is abhorred and one who seeks fulfilment of desires does not attract admiration in this world
whatever a preceptor an old man a king and a father commands whether it is out of anger or pleasure or passion must be carried out as dharma who will not do it unless he is heartless
it is impossible for me not to execute the promise completely o my dear he dasaratha is our preceptor and therefore fit to command us even for mother kausalya he is her husband her refuge and her dharma
while the righteous king is living more importantly treading the righteous path how can mother kausalya like an ordinary widow accompany me leaving this city
grant me permission o mother to depart for the forest bless me and perform ceremonies for my wellbeing so that i shall return to the city after completion of my exile like yayati who came back to heaven with the strength of truth
i will not forsake this great glory of fulfilling my fathers promise for the sake of the kingdom in this transient existence o mother i do not wish to acquire this insignificant earth unrighteously
rama the best among men thus pacified his mother insisting on his desire to depart for dandaka forest with courage and elaborately instructed his brother about his good intentions after which he circumambulated his mother with all his heart     thus ends the twentyfirst sarga of ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
the selfpossessed rama held his composure and approached his beloved intimate brother lakshmana who was looking miserable with his mental agony to him who was hissing like a king cobra he said
restrain your anger and sorrow dismiss this humiliation from the mind achieve great happiness through fortitude remove whatever preparations have been made for the purpose of my consecration today and act quickly so that there is no obstacle
o lakshmana the same enthusiasm with which preparations for my consecration were made be shown for the cessation of those arrangements
act in such a way that our mother kaikeyi whose heart ached due to my consecration should not entertain any doubt
even for a moment o lakshmana i am not inclined to ignore her sorrow caused by the apprehension in her mind about the possibility of ramas coronation
i do not remember to have done anything any time with a motive or without understanding which might have caused even a little displeasure to father or mothers
let my father who is always truthful who is really valiant who is always striving for truth and who is afraid of the next world be fearless
if the preparations for the consecration are not withdrawn my father will suffer mental agony for the fear that his word has not come true and his agony will torment me
therefore o lakshmana i want the arrangement for coronation withdrawn before i proceed to the forest from here itself
immediately after my departure to the forest the kings kekayas daughter having accomplished her objective will enthrone bharata without any distraction
kaikeyi will attain peace of mind only after my departure to the forest in tattered clothes an antelope skin and a crown of matted locks
with wellcomposed mind this decision has been taken i do not like to inflict pain on dasaratha or kaikeyi i shall therefore depart to the forest without delay
if the award of the kingdom to me is revoked o lakshmana and if i am banished in this manner see it is destiny
if this thought and my misfortune were not caused in kaikeyi by destiny how could she muster such determination to inflict pain on me
you know o gentle lakshmana that never in the past had i any feeling of distinction amongst my mothers and kaikeyi never differentiated between me and her son
i do not find any reason other than destiny for the cruel and brutal words spoken by kaikeyi with the objective of preventing my coronation and exiling me
if destiny is not the cause behind this how could kaikeyi who is gifted with virtues and a noble nature speak such painful words to me before her husband like an ordinary woman
inconceivable is the power of destiny its impact on all beings cannot be averted that an adversity has befallen me and kaikeyi is therefore evident
o lakshmana which mortal has the power to fight with destiny the grip of which can be comprehended by following its course only through its effect and nowhere else
happiness or misery fear or anger gain or loss birth or death and all such things are surely the acts of destiny
even rishis with severe austerities are tormented by destiny and are swerved from their observances because of anger and passion
any unanticipated and sudden hindrance to the action undertaken shall be deemed to be the act of destiny
even though my consecration was thwarted there is no feeling of sadness in me in fact i controlled my mind by my intellect
therefore be free from grief like me and revoke all the arrangements made for the consecration ceremony immediately
with these very pots of holy water brought for the purpose of consecration o lakshmana i shall take bath at the time of taking vow for practising penance
or else for me what is the use of these pots of holy water which are the kings property the water drawn with my own hands will be made use of for my religious bath
do not grieve o lakshmana over the loss of the kingdom living in exile is more glorious than running the kingdom
o lakshmana our younger mother kaikeyi cannot be blamed for her obstruction to my coronation overpowered by destiny she is speaking such unpleasant words this you know is the impact of destiny     thus ends the twentysecond sarga of ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
while rama was speaking thus lakshmana listened to him with his head down experiencing both grief and joy
lakshmana frowning between his eyebrows hissed like a great serpent seized with anger in its hole
with his frown his face looked frightening like the face of a lion provoked
shaking his forearm like an elephant raising its trunk moving his neck horizontally and vertically and casting a pointed and oblique look at his brother lakshmana said
o rama the greatest among the brave kshatriyas you say this because of your fear that by disobeying fathers command harm will be done to righteousness this great haste is unwarranted for there is the least apprehension about peoples verdict in favour of exile how do you of all persons speak about destiny as allpowerful in these circumstances when it is powerless
why do you extol this pitiable and powerless destiny why dont you doubt those two vicious persons dasaratha and kaikeyi
why dont you realise o virtuous one that there are soft means of creating hindrances in their plan without trangressing dharma you know dharma why dont you understand that their acts of deception wear the guise of dharma
if both of them had not decided before o rama the boon granted to kaikeyi naturally would have been fulfilled long ago
the consecration of any one other than you o valiant one is universally detested i do not want to tolerate this act you should pardon me in this matter
o noble minded one i hate this righteousness which has deluded your intellect and created this dilemma about this issue
when you are able to counter this move why do you want to execute the unjustifiable and contemptible words of the king who is under the spell of kaikeyi
i am grieved that even though this plot has been hatched by a treacherous mind you are not taking it in the right perspective censurable is adherence to virtue
as both of them are steeped in passion they never thought of your wellbeing how will you fulfil the wishes of these enemies miscalled parents
it might be your opinion that their dictate is the decree of destiny even then it does not satisfy me it destiny should be ignored
those who are timid and cowardly alone depend on destinythe valiant with of selfrespect will not accept it
in the case of one capable of striking destiny with human efforts it cannot defeat his objective and bring him despondency
today all will witness the power of destiny and the power of man the difference between man and destiny will be manifested today
today people will see destiny defeated by my valour just as they saw your consecration defeated obstructed by destiny
i will make destiny the elephant running wild on the strength of the rut unmanageable even by the goad turn back with my valour
all the guardians of the quarters and all the three worlds united cannot prevent the consecration of rama today what to speak of our father king dasaratha
o king those who with mutual support banished you to the forest will themselves dwell in the forest for fourteen years
therefore i shall frustrate the desire of father and of kaikeyi who plans the kingdom for her son by obstructing your consecration
any one who opposes my terrible valour will come to grief the power of destiny will not cause that much sorrow as my valour will
when after ruling the subjects for a thousand years you withdraw into the forest for yativrata your sons will rule them
leaving their sons to look after the subjects as their own children the rajarsis in ancient times used to retire into the forest as per practice
o righteous one if you apprehend chaos in the kingdom for want of wholehearted support from the feudatory kings then o my valiant brother i swear to you i will protect your kingdom like the shore protecting the ocean or else i shall never attain the afterworld of heroes
the consecration may be performed with these auspicious materials i am alone capable of facing these kings with my valour
these my arms are not intended to enhance the beauty of my body this bow is not for decoration the sword is not for the sake of strapping my waist the arrows are not meant to be fixed to my quiver all these four are meant for taming my enemies
any one who turns my enemy will not be allowed to remain alive holding my sharpedged sword lustrous as a flash of lightning i shall exterminate my enemy even if it were indra the bearer of thunder
this entire earth will become impenetrable and impassable scattered with the trunks thighs and heads of elephants horses and warriors hacked off with my sword
the elephants struck by the blows of my sword will fall on earth like mountains engulfed in flames and like clouds with lightning
when i stand before men enemies wearing godha and fingerprotector holding the bow ready who amongst men will boast of his manliness
striking each of my foes with many arrows and many with one arrow i shall aim them at the vitals of men horses and elephants
o lord today you shall see the power of my glorious weapons in depriving the king dasaratha of his authority and establishing your supremacy over the kingdom
these arms o rama which are fit for sandalwood cream for wearing armlets for distributing wealth and for protecting friends will perform the worthy act of subduing those who are creating obstruction to your consecration
tell me your enemy who should be deprived of his life fame and friends command me as to how this earth shall come under your control now itself i shall do that i am your servant
having perceived that rama was determined to carry out his fathers command kausalya with her throat choked with tears said these words of piety
how will this righteous rama born to me through dasaratha who speaks pleasantly to all and who has not experienced any sorrow before live on the grains gleaned
how will rama live on roots and fruits in the forest hereafter when his servants and attendants enjoy delicious food here
who will believe that the virtuous and affectionate scion of the raghus is exiled this way by the king who will not tremble in fear to hear this
o rama if you being the delight of the world are ordered to go to the forest it has to be said certainly that destiny which rules everything is allpowerful
after your departure o son an incomparably huge fire of grief with sighs of exhaustion will burst from my body fanned by the wind of your absence and fuelled by lamentation and affliction my wailing tears will be the oblations my anxiety will be the great smoke rising vapour this fire of grief will leave me very much emaciated and burn me like fire burns a forest of dead trees or a bunch of dry grass in summer
i shall follow you wherever you go my son like a cow following its calf how is it possible for a cow not to follow its wandering calf
at these words of his mother who was deeply afflicted rama best among men replied
the king was deceived by kaikeyi if you also desert him after i have gone to the forest surely he will not live
for a woman to desert her husband is a cruel act you must not do that which is contemptible even to think
as long as the king my father the lord of the earth a descendant of kakutshta lives you shall serve him this is eternal virtue in a woman
at these words of rama unshakable in action auspiciouslooking kausalya exceedingly pleased said be it so
thus addressed rama the foremost among upholders of righteousness said to his mother who was in deep grief
you and i should obey fathers words he is the king supporter preceptor the best among men and lord and master of all of us
roaming the wild forest for fourteen years i shall abide by your words with supreme pleasure
thus addressed by rama the affectionate kausalya deeply distressed her eyes filled with tears said to her beloved son
o rama i am not able to live in the midst of these cowives o descendant of kakutstha if you have resolved to go to the forest as per the wishes of your father take mea wild deeralong with you into the forest
adding his tears to his mothers who was wailing rama said as long as a woman lives her husband is her god and also her lord master
the powerful king has authority over you as well as over me as long as he is the sagacious lord of the entire world how can we be without a master
bharata who is virtuous and speaks pleasantly to all beings and who is always attached to righteousness will surely remain obedient to you
after my departure you must see that the king is not overpowered by grief for his son and struggles as little as possible
see that the old king does not succumb to this terrible grief serve him with a composed mind
a woman may be highly pious engaged in vows and fastings but if she does not follow her husband she will be condemned to hell
a woman who serves her husband will attain the highest heaven even if she pays no homage to gods and abstains from worshipping them
a wife who serves her husband and who is engaged in doing good to him is righteous this dharma exists in this world since ancient times declared in the vedas and the smritis
for my sake o devi worship the firegod with offerings of oblations and flowers and brahmins who are true to religious vows
looking forward to my return spend your time this way with moderate intake a mind under control and a life devoted to the service of your husband
if my father who is the best among the upholders of righteousness survives till i come back you will have your highest desires fulfilled
to these words of rama kausalya distressed with grief for her son replied with her eyes filled with tears
i am unable to dissuade you o my brave son from your firm resolve to go to the forest it is surely difficult for me to bide time
go with a steadfast mind o my son may god be gracious only with your return i shall be relieved of my suffering
o reverend one when you come back after having accomplished your purpose performed your vows and acquitted yourself of the debt you owe your father i shall attain supreme happiness
o rama inconceivable is the course of destiny which is inciting you to go to the forest disregarding my words
go now o my mightyarmed son and come back safe and on your return delight me with your sweet gentle utterances
o my dear child how pleasing would it be if today were to be the day of your return from the forest when i can see you wearing matted hair and robes of bark
seeing rama full of auspicious qualities resolved to go to the forest and having spoken to him with the fullness of her heart devi kausalya now braced herself up to perform ceremonies in the interest of ramas wellbeing     thus ends the twentyfourth sarga of ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
highminded mother kausalya her anguish subdued performed the sipping rite achamana and her self rendered pure performed auspicious ceremonies for rama
i am unable to dissuade you o the best among the descendants of raghus from going into the forest go now and return soon follow in the footsteps of the virtuous
the duty which you are carrying out with courage and selfdiscipline o tiger among the descendants of raghu will alone protect you
o my son may the gods in the temples and in other sacred places and the maharshis you bow to protect you in the forest
may the weapons endowed with mantric qualities which were bestowed on you by sagacious viswamitra always protect you
o my mighty armed son protected by the service to your father mother and to truth live long
o best of men may sacrificial fuel kusa grass and sacred rings made of kusha grass sacrificial altars temples various levelled sacrificial grounds mountains trees plants lakes birds serpents and lions protect you
may all gods known as sadhyas visvedevatas maruts great ascetics the sustainer virat purusha the preserver of creation lord brahma sun bhaga aryama and all other important guardians of the world headed by indra bestow their blessings on you
may the six seasons years months fortnights nights days and moments bring good to you
o my son may smriti dhriti and dharma always guard you may divine personages and gods skanda soma brihaspati the seven rishis and narada protect you at all times
may siddhas guardians of the quarters invoked by me protect you from all directions in that forest at all times o my son
when you dwell in the forest may all the mountains seas lord varuna heaven space and earth and also all rivers all stars and planets with their presiding deities day night dawn and dusk protect you
may all the six pious seasons months years kala and kashta contribute to your wellbeing
may gods and demons always give you happiness when you wander in that great forest clad in ascetic garb
let there be no fear from rakshasas who are fearful to look at and commit cruel acts from pisachas evil spirits and from flesheating animals o my child
may monkeys scorpions wild gnats mosquitoes reptiles and insects in that inaccessible forest not trouble you
may the mighty elephants lions with pointed incisors tigers bears and fierce wild horned buffaloes do you no harm o my dear son
may the ferocious breed of cernivores i worship not harm you o my child
o rama may your path be auspecious may your valour be fruitful go safel and achieve success in everything
may gods from the sky the earth and all other gods protect you and let there be no harm to you from your foes
propitiated by my worship o rama may brihaspati moon sun kubera and yama protect you when you are in dandaka forest
may fire wind smoke and mantras emanated from the mouths of rishis protect you when you take your ablutions o son of the raghu race o joy of the raghus
may siva lord of all the worlds visnu supporter of living beings brahma rishis and all the rest of the gods protect you while you dwell in the forest
thus illustrious largeeyed kausalya worshipped hosts of gods by offering them garlands and fragrant substances with appropriate prayers
after collecting the sacred fire through great brahmins she duly offered oblations to the gods for the welfare of rama
noble kausalya procured clarified butter garlands of white flowers sacred fuel and grains of white mustard seed for oblations to the gods
the officiating priest performed the ritual of sacrificial offerings strictly in accordance with rules for peace and happiness of rama with the remainder of the offerings he performed whatever ceremonies were to be done externally
thereafter she made the brahmins pronounce benedictory prayers offering honey curd rice and clarified butterthen she got mantras expiatory rites recited for averting evil to rama while in the forest
the illustrious kausalya mother of rama gave abundant gifts to the best of the brahmins and thereafter said to him
may the same blessings bestowed by all the gods on the thousandeyed indra at the time of killing vritra be with you
may you be conferred with the same blessings which vinata bestowed on garuda at the time of bringing nectar
may you be bestowed with the same blessings conferred by aditi on indra the wielder of thunder for the killing of daityas at the time nectar was generated
o rama by occupying three footsteps of space highly lustrous visnu owned the three worlds and obtained glory may you obtain similar auspiciousness
o mightyarmed rama may the auspicious and prosperous seasons seas islands the vedas the worlds and the quarters bless you
the largeeyed kausalya placed the remains of the offerings on his ramas head and applied sandal cream to his body she tied an auspicious medicinal herb known as vishalyakarani to his arm for attainment of his objectives repeatedly muttering prayers
even though kausalya was filled with distress she appeared as if she was very much happy she uttered mere words in a confusing tone without applying her mind
illustrious kausalya embraced rama bending his head down and smelt his forehead and then said o rama go in peace and come back after accomplishing the objective
o my son i shall be happy to behold you back in ayodhya in sound health successful in your objectives and firmly established in the kingdom
when you return from the forest like the full moon rising i shall behold you with my anxieties gone and my face sparkling with joy
after you have fulfilled your fathers words and returned from your exile i shall behold you seated on the throne o rama
o rama credited with auspicious events on return from the forest fulfil my desires and those of my daughterinlaw sita
o son of the raghu race lord siva and other gods the great rishis bhutas great asuras and serpents and four quarters worshipped by me will always promote your welfare when you dwell in the forest
thus with her eyes brimming with tears she duly completed the benedictory rites and circumambulated the scion of the raghus and embraced him again and again holding him tight
circumambulated by mother kausalya the illustrious scion of the raghu race clasped his mothers feet again and again and shining in his glory proceeded to the palace of sita     thus ends the twentyfifth sarga of ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
after the benedictory rites were performed by his mother kausalya rama paid obeisance to her and staying on the righteous path decided to depart to the forest he entered the highway thronged with people and illumining it with his lustre and stirred their hearts with remembrances of his excellent virtues
sita her mind preoccupied with thoughts about consecration was engaged in religious austerities and hence could not hear of all this development
experienced in palace rituals sita grateful to god after performing worship of the deities was awaiting in a happy mood the arrival of the prince
his head bent down in embarrassment rama entered his welldecorated residence thronged with excited people
sita got up suddenly her limbs trembling to see her husband distressed with grief and agitated with anxiety
on seeing her virtuous rama could not contain the sorrow in his mind which manifested through his external appearance
on seeing rama with a pale face indignant and heavily perspiring sita consumed with grief said my lord why are you now like this
o scion of the raghu race today has been declared by learned brahmins a suitable and auspicious day for consecration under pushya star with brihaspati as presiding deity then why are you dejected
how is it that your charming face shines not today under a hundredribbed umbrella white like foam in water
how is it that your face with its lotuslike eyes is not being fanned by excellent fans of the colour of the moon or the swan
how is it that o best among men eloquent panegyrists charioteers bards are not seen singing your praise with auspicious words
how is it that brahmins versed in the vedas have not duly sprinkled the mixture of honey and curd on your head prior to your consecration
how is it that welladorned ministers citizens from towns and villages heads of guilds and others do not follow you
how is it that the chief ceremonial chariot decorated with gold and harnessed by four galloping horses is not preceding you
how is it that the elephant whose lustre resembles that of a mountain or a dark cloud and endowed with auspicious features is not seen leading your procession o valiant one
o heroic one o handsome one how is it that i do not see your attendants proceeding in front with the throne carved in gold
how is it that when arrangements are under way now for your consecration the complexion of your countenance does not look like what it was before there is no joy on your face
o sita my venerable father is banishing me to the forest said rama the scion of the raghus the joy of the raghu race seeing her thus lamenting
you were born in a noble family you know and practise dharma i shall tell you how this banishment has come about do listen
my father king dasaratha true to his promise had earlier granted two great boons to my mother kaikeyi
when the king was preparing for my consecration she reminded him of the promise and in the name of righteousness he has been cornered
i am to dwell in the dandaka forest for fourteen years while father has appointed bharata princeregent
i have come to see you before departing for the desolate dandaka forest you should never praise me in the presence of bharata because intellectuals cannot tolerate others being praised before them you should never extol my virtues before him
never expect special treatment from bharata you can continue to stay with him here by conducting yourself in a favourable manner
o sita the king has conferred the hereditary regency on him therefore o sita you must make efforts to win his favour especially a kings
i am leaving for the forest right away for fulfilling my fathers pledge o highminded sita be steady
o sinless auspicious one engage yourself in vratas and fasting after my departure to the forest inhabited by ascetics
you must rise in time and with the household gods duly worshipped pay obeisance to my father king dasaratha
in terms of love affection and service the rest of my mothers are all equal therefore you must pay them due respect regularly
what is more important is that you should look on bharata as your brother and satrughna as your son they are dearer to me than my life
now bharata is the king of the country and head of the family therefore you should never do anything disagreeable to him
kings are gratified if they are served with zeal and good conduct if the contrary happens they get provoked
kings abandon even their own sons if they are harmful and receive capable people even if they are strangers
o auspicious one live here by being obedient to king bharata absorbed in righteousness follow truth and religious vows
o my beloved sita i am going to the wild forest stay here and never cause displeasure to any one in any way could you carry out these words of mine     thus ends the twentysixth sarga of ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
when the sweettongued daughter of videha sita who deserved affection heard this she was very angry out of her love for rama she said these wordsto her husband in reply
o rama why are you speaking so lightly o prince if you hear these very same words spoken to you you will ridicule me
o son of a noble monarch father mother brother son or daughterinlaw everybody experiences the merit of their past deeds and receives what is due from destiny
a wife alone o best of men shares the destiny of her husband i am also therefore ordered to dwell in the forest a command to you is a command to me
it is not her father or mother nor her son or herself nor her friends but her husband alone gives a woman the permanent refuge in this or in the next world
o son of the raghus if you set out for the impenetrable forest now itself i shall also go walking ahead of you and crushing the thorns and spiky kusa grass rendering the path comfortable for you to walk
do take me with you o valiant one without hesitation dismiss all anger and envy from your mind like the leftover water after drinking anger because she disobeys and envy because she too like rama is willing to brave the hazards of forest life there is no fault on my part
every woman everywhere be it on the top of mansions or in lovely palaces or flying in the sky should take shelter at his her husbands feet or follow his footsteps
i have been so instructed by my parents about diverse duties in all stages of life that i need not be told anything about my duties now
i will also go to the forest which is impassable uninhabited teeming with various kinds of animals and infested with tigers and wolves
free from any anxiety about the three worlds my only concern will be my duties towards my husband i shall dwell as happily in the forest as i did in my fathers abode
i shall wander with you o heroic rama in the honeyscented forest remaining selfpossessed always doing your service and observing the vow of celibacy
o respector of individuals when you are capable of protecting other people in the forest what of me
there is no doudt that i shall go with you to the forest today o distinguished one i cannot be restrained from this resolve
do not doubt that i shall not be able to live on fruits and roots or that i will create difficulty for you while living with you
living with you sans fear o my sagacious husband i wish to see the rivers mountains lakes and forests here and there
i wish to enjoy the lotus lakes in full bloom abounding in swans and ducks in the company of a brave husband like you
observing such vows and bathing daily in the lotus lakes i shall be very much happy to sport with you o largeeyed one
thus living in your company for a thousand years or even a hundred thousand years i shall not feel the passing of time i shall not desire even heaven
o raghava tiger among men if i were given heaven to live in without you even that i shall not covet
i shall go along with you to the highly impenetrable forest infested with animals like monkeys and elephants i shall live in the forest in full discipline as in my fathers abode taking shelter at your feet
since i have no thought other than you and my heart is irretrievably attached to you i have resolved to die if separated from you pray be favourably disposed to take me i shall not be a burden to you
although sita was thus appealing rama devoted to righteousness was still unwilling to take her in order to dissuade her he began to describe to the mournful sita the many hardships of forest life     thus ends the twentyseventh sarga of ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
rama who knew his duties and was devoted to righteousness reflected on the difficulties of forest life and did not agree to take sita even though she was pleading the way she did
righteous rama consoled sita whose eyes were blurred with tears and in order to dissuade her from going to the forest said again
born in a noble race o sita you are always devoted to duty follow your duty here it will make me happy
do as i tell you o delicate sita there are indeed many hardships in the forest i shall tell you all about them listen to me
give up the desire to live in the forest o sita living in the dreary jungle it is said has many hardships
i am saying all this in your interest the forest is a haven of hardships i know of no happiness in the forest
it is frightening to hear the sounds of waterfalls and the roar of lions living in the mountain caves therefore forest life is painful fearful
big wild animals moving about freely and sporting in the deserted forest attack on seeing a human thus forest is full of danger
the rivers infested with crocodiles and filled with mud are difficult to cross even for elephants in rut hence forest life is always extremely dangerous
the paths full of thorny creepers echoing with the noise of wild fowls and with no water to drink are difficult to tread so forest is a source of suffering
with the senses under control night and day o sita one must be satisfied with the fruits fallen from trees therefore forest life is full of suffering
one has to wear robes of bark and matted hair and take to fasting as long as one can o daughter of mithila
one has to worship gods and ancestors according to tradition and extend hospitality to guests who arrive unexpectedly
one has to wander about all the while like an ascetic as per the customs and take ablutions three times a day at prescribed hours hence life in the forest is extremely hard
flowers collected with ones own hands o innocent one should be offered on the altar as per injunction of the vedas therefore life in the forest is difficult
the wanderers in the jungle o daughter of mithila have to be satisfied daily with whatever little food is available so forest life is a hard life
there is extreme wind and darkness hunger and fear therefore forest life is difficult
there are various forms of fierce reptiles fearlessly crawling on the ground so living in the forest is extremely dangerous
the serpents that live in and move like meandering rivers always obstruct the paths therefore living in the forest is tremendously difficult
birds scorpions insects gnats and mosquitoes always create trouble therefore life in the forest is all suffering
o lovely sita there are thorny trees with branches on the top interlaced with one another there are kusa grass and reeds so forest life is very hard
there are various physical afflictions and fears for one who lives in the forest therefore forest brings suffering
anger and greed have to be given up with the mind preoccupied with ascetic practices one should not be afraid of fearful situations hence forest life always very hard
thus forest life is not suitable for you on reconsideration i see that there are many dangers in forest life
when the great rama decided not to take her along with him to the forest sita deeply grieved said these words     thus ends the twentyeighth sarga of ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
having heard the words of rama thus spoke sita in a faint voice in sadness with tears flowing incessantly from her eyes
understand that the difficulties of forest life described by you will be turned into advantages if they are accompanied by your affection
o scion of the raghu race antelopes lions elephants tigers sarabhas birds srimaras and other wild beasts wandering in the forest have not seen your beauty before now on seeing you they will flee away in fact who will not be afraid of seeing an object of fear
in accordance with the command of the elders i must accompany you to the forest if i am separated from you i will give up my life here itself
if i am in your company o rama even the lord of the gods indra with all his might will not be able to hurt me
your salutary instruction to me o rama is a woman cannot live without her husband this truth is greatly applicable to me
o highly sagacious rama i had also heard in my fathers house long ago from brahmins prophesing that some day i shall have certainly to dwell in the forest
o mighty hero ever since i heard the prophesies from the brahmin palmists i am yearning to dwell in the forest
therefore o my beloved i must certainly obtain such a command to dwell in the forest i must accompany you to the forest and it cannot be otherwise
i will go with you true to the prediction of the brahmin that time has come and let his prediction come to pass
i am aware o valiant one that there are hardships of every kind in forest life but they befall those whose senses are not under their control
when i was young in my fathers house a holy female mendicant foretold in the presence of my mother that i would dwell in the forest in this life
pleased with my long entreaties in the past to dwell with you in the forest o lord you had granted my desire
since then i have been counting time for this forest life it pleases me to follow my valiant hero as he lives in the forest rama prosperity to you
o my purehearted one by following my husband with love i shall become sinless because my husband is my god
my union with you o highminded one is auspicious even beyond death a woman given away by her parents in accordance with traditional offerings of water belongs to him even after death and lives with him this is a statement from the vedas quoted by famous brahmins
why dont you want to take to the forest your own wife who is loyal and devoted and is of good conduct
o rama i am faithful and devoted to you i have equal disposition to happiness and sorrow i equally share your prosperity and adversity therefore you should take your wife to the forest in this time of distress
if you do not wish to take your wife in this time of distress to the forest i shall die by consuming poison or throwing myself into fire or drowning in water
despite sitas pleadings with him in various ways the mightyarmed rama would not consent to take her to the desolate forest
thus spoken to prevented sita was filled with grief and cried drenching the ground with warm tears that fell from her eyes
that selfpossessed scion of the kakutstha dynasty consoled the copperredlipped sita in several ways to dissuade her from going to the forest     thus ends the twentyninth sarga of ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
in response to ramas consolation with regard to her stay in the forest the daughter of janaka maithili sita said
sita agitated over a supreme cause upbraided the broadchested scion of the raghu race out of love and injured selfrespect
o rama while accepting you as soninlaw did my father king of mithila and lord of videha ever think that you are a woman in the guise of a man
alas that will be a falschood if people out of ignorance say that there is no supreme splendour in rama like the shining sun
what may be the cause for your fear and depression behind your desire to desert one who is so exclusively devoted to you
know o valiant one that by remaining subordinate to you i am as faithful to you as savitri was to her husband satyavanta son of dyumatsena
o sinless son of the raghus i am not like other women who bring disgreace to the family i have not looked at any one except you even with my minds eye i will go to the forest along with you
i have been living with you for a long time o rama i am young and chaste why do you like an actor wish to hand me over to others
you o sinless rama may become subservient and obedient to them about whose wellfare you are speaking of and on account of whom you are preventing me to go along with you
you should not depart for the forest without taking me be it for penance or for the forest or for heaven i wish to be with you
while following you i will feel no fatigue there on the way as if i am going on a pleasurestroll or in a comfortable couch
the white reeds the kusha the sara and the ishika grasses and thorny trees on the way will feel as soft as cotton or as the skin of a black antelope
i shall regard o charming rama the harmful dust raised by the stormy wind and settled on me as the most excellent sandal powder
o rover of the forest i will feel happier when i sleep on the meadows of tender green grass on the outskirts of the forest than when i sleep on the couch spread with carpets
whatever leaves or roots or fruits you collect with your own hands for me little or much they will be nectar to me
enjoying the seasonal flowers and fruits in the forest i will not remember my mother or father or home
therefore you should not anticipate any problem from me in the forest neither shall i be burdensome to you nor shall i make you experience any sorrow on my account
wherever i be with you is heaven and without hell o rama recognise this truth and derive great pleasure in my company
if you do not take me to the forest without the least hesitation i shall consume poison right now but not live under the control of enemies at ayodhya
if forsaken o lord i shall not live a life of sorrow instant death is better than abandoned existence
i cannot bear this grief even for a moment what to speak of fourteen ten and three and one years of grieving
tormented with grief sita piteously and profusely lamented and then exhausted embraced her husband tightly and cried bitterly
pierced by so many words of objection from rama sita felt like a cowelephant penetrated by poisonsmeared arrrows and shed her longsuppressed tears like arani a firekindling stick kindling fire
crystallike tears arising out of distress flowed from her eyes like water trickling from two lotuses
her face with large eyes assumed the brightness of an immaculate moon and withered with tears like a lotus plucked out of water
with his arms rama embraced sita who had almost fainted in grief and in order to create confidence in her he said these words
when you are in grief o devi i do not desire even heaven like the selfcreated brahma i have no fear for any one
o sita of auspicious countenance even though i am capable of protecting you i did not like your stay in the forest as i did not know your intentions
since you o daughter of mithila were born to go along with me to the forest i cannot abandon you just as a selfrespecting man cannot forsake his reputation
o one with shapely thighs like the trunk of an elephant follow only the path of righteousness practised earlier by the virtuous as suvarchala follows the sun
not that i shall not go to the forest go i must my fathers word nourished by truth is leading me there o daughter of janaka
obedience to parents is a righteous act therefore o one with fair hips i cannot live and disobey the word of truth
mother father and preceptor are present before us by overstepping them how can we in various ways worship god who is beyond reach not visible
where these threemotherfather and preceptor equal to the three worlds are o one with loverly sideglances there is none in this world as holy therefore they are to be worshipped
truth or munificence or homage or distribution of gifts to the revered ones or sacrifices o sita are not considered as efficacious as service to father
by fulfilling fathers wish nothing is difficult to achieve whether it is heaven or wealth or foodgrains or learning or sons or other comforts
great men who are devoted to the service of their parents attain the world of the gods of gandharvas of cows of visnu of brahma and other worlds
my father who follows the path of truth and dharma whatever be his commands i wish to obey he is indeed dharma eternal
o sita my discretion fails me in deciding whether to take you to dandaka forest or not you are however firmly determined to follow me saying you can live in the forest
o one with fascinating eyes and exquisite beauty you were born to live in the forest o gentle lady assist me in carrying out my duties
you o my lovely beloved sita have taken in the right time a highly dignified decision befitting in all ways your family myself and yourself
o sita begin right now all preparations necessary for residing in the forest o one with beautiful buttocks without you even the very heaven does not please me
give away your jewels to brahmins who need them and food to religious mendicants hurry up do not delay
distribute among your attendants highly valuable ornaments and excellent clothing charming articles meant for court sport my couches chariots and all other things offer the rest to brahmins
having come to know that her departure to the forest is acceptable to her husband sita highly delighted quickly got ready to give away things
having heard her husband the glorious and broadminded sita was delighted with her desires fulfiled she made preparations to gift away her wealth including jewels to the virtuous     thus ends the thirtieth sarga of ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
lakshmana who had already reached there heard the conversation between sita and rama his eyes brimming with tears he was unable to bear the grief he held the feet of his brother tightly and said to the illustrious sita and rama of great resolve
if you have decided to go to the forest where deer and elephants abound i shall also accompany you by walking before you holding the bow
accompanied by me you will roam the forests echoing with the cries of birds and sounds of herds of animals
without you i do not want victory over the gods or sovereignty over the worlds or even immortality
when rama tried to dissuade lakshmana with many words of consolation lakshmana who was determined to go to the forest said again
you have granted permission to me earlierwhy are you now preventing me
i wish to know o sinless one the reason why you are dissuading me when i am willing to go with you this creates a doubt in my mind
addressing the heroic lakshmana in front of him imploring with folded hands to take him to the forest so that he may walk ahead and guard them the effulgent rama said
you are affectionate you are devoted to dharma you are valiant you always walk the path of virtue you are dear to me like my own life you are not only an obedient brother but also a friend
o lakshmana if you also accompany me to the forest who will take care of mother kausalya and the illustrious sumitra
dasaratha the mighty king like parjanya the raingod lord of the earth used to shower favours on earth but now he is bound by the noose of passion
once the daughter of king aswapati kaikeyi gains control over the kingdom she will do nothing to help her afflicted cowives kausalya and sumitra
when bharata secures the kingdom his confidence reposed in kaikeyi he will not bother about the miserable kausalya and sumitra
either by yourself or by seeking the favour of the king o son of sumitra lend support to venerable kausalya this is the objective you must accomplish
if you do this your devotion to me will be amply demonstrated service to the elders o dutiful one is a virtue great and unequalled
o delight of the raghu race do this for my sake since deprived of us there will be no happiness for our mother o son of sumitra
thus addressed by rama who was an adept in the use of words eloquent lakshmana gently replied
aware of your power o valiant one bharata will undoubtedly pay respect to kausalya and sumitra with all humility
noble kausalya has under her charge a thousand villages for her sustenance she can support a thousand men like me
illustrious kausalya is competent enough to support herself my mother and men like me
make me your follower there is no breach of virtue in this i will have my purpose accomplished your object also will be fulfilled
holding the bow and arrows and carrying a crowbar and a basket i shall go in front of you leading the way
i shall daily collect roots fruits and other forest products fit for ascetics
when you go about for pleasure on mountain slopes along with sita i shall do everything for you whether you are awake or asleep
pleased with his words rama said o lakshmana go and take leave of all your friends
o lakshmana in the great sacrifice performed by the highsouled janaka varuna himself gave him two aweinspiring celestial bows two impenetrable divine armours two quivers with inexhaustible arrows two swords plated with gold and as bright as the sun all these weapons are deposited in the house of our preceptor sage vasistha where they are being worshipped go and bring them swiftly
lakshmana who was resolved to go to the forest took leave of his friends and collected from the house of vasistha preceptor of the ikshvaku race the powerful weapons deposited with him
lakshmana tiger among princes brought all those divine weapons sanctified and decorated with garlands and showed them to rama
o handsome lakshmana you have come at the expected time said the selfpossessed rama affectionately when he saw him arrive
let us give away o tormentor of enemies lakshmana my belogings to the ascetic brahmins
here live the best of brahmins who are deeply devoted to their teachers along with those who are dependent on me for their livelihood
fetch suyajna son of vasistha best among the brahmins along with all other distinguished brahmins to whom i will pay my homage and leave for the forest     thus ends the thirtyfirst sarga of ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
lakshmana having understood the very auspicious and welcome order of rama immediately proceeded to the house of suyajna
lakshmana paid homage to him who was in the firesanctuary and said o friend come and see the palace of rama who is the accomplisher of all difficult tasks
after performing the twilight prayers suyajna along with lakshmana went straight away and entered the beautiful and prosperous palace of rama
on the arrival of sage suyajna wellversed in the vedas both rama and sita offered obeisance to him as to firegod and circumambulated him
rama scion of the kakutstha dynasty worshipped suyajna with a collection of golden ornaments such as earrings anklets armlets bracelets and many other ornaments of precious stones then urged by sita rama said to him
o handsome friend now sita intends to give away to your wife her necklace her golden chain and girdle could you accept them
sita is departing for the forest and offers your wife her armlets wonderful and elegant bracelets
sita also wishes to give away a couch with an exquisite cover encrusted with a variety of precious stones
i am gifting you o best among brahmins a thousand elephants including satrunjaya an elephant my maternal uncle had given me
thus addressed by rama suyajna accepted the gifts and conferred auspicious blessings on rama lakshmana and sita
sweettongued rama calmly said to his brother lakshmana like brahma addressing indra
o lakshmana invite agastya and kausika the two celebrated brahmins and bestow on them with reverence plenty of precious gems like showers of rain on standing crops
satisfy them o highlyarmed lakshmana o bestower of honour with a thousand cows gold silver and with the great wealth of gems
o lakshmana give away chariots maidservants silk clothes to learned brahmins of taittiriya branch and wellversed in the vedas to agreeable and faithful brahmins attending on kausalya with their blessings till they are fully satisfied
noble counsellor of our father and charioteer chitraratha has been in our service for many years gratify him with invaluable jewels clothes wealth with young female calves and a thousand cows
o lakshmana many brahmacharis with a staff as a mark of religious authority wellversed in katha and kalapa portions of the vedas engaged daily in the study of the vedas and nothing else not active otherwise they are fond of delicious food and are respected even by great people give them eighty carts filled with gems a thousand bulls capable of carrying paddy and two hundred oxen capable of ploughing land and a thousand cows for preparing food with milk products
give each of the large number of brahmacharis wearing girdles and working under kausalya a thousand cows or gold coins o lakshmana
you should o lakshmana treat all those brahmins in such a way that my mother shall be pleased on seeing my respectful offerings
thereupon lakshmana a tiger among men personally distributed like kubera gifts of riches to all those indras among brahmins best of brahmins in accordance with the instructions of rama
rama then bestowed abundant wealth on each of the dependents as they stood with their throats choked with tears saying
till i come back guard each of the palaces of lakshmana and mine and ensure that they are not left unattended
having spoken thus to all dependents who were overcome with grief rama ordered the treasury officer to bring the entire treasure
when all the dependents fetched the entire wealth of rama they were pleased to see the great heap of wealth
rama best among men got the entire wealth distributed among indigent brahmins and young and old alike with the help of lakshmana
a brahmin by name trijata a descendant of sage garga and of reddishbrown colour used to live in that region earning his livelihood in the forest by digging the earth with an ironspade and a plough
his young wife highly distressed due to poverty keeping her young sons before her said to the aged brahmin
listen to me throw away this ironspade go and see the righteous ramayou may obtain something
at the words of his wife trijata took the path to ramas palace having wrapped himself with a torn upper garment
no one in the crowd stopped tirjata until he reached the fifth courtyard as he looked like bhrigu and angirasa in brilliance
trijata approached rama and said o illustrious prince i am a destitute and have many children i am living in the forest by collecting leftover grains look at me
rama jokingly replied to him i have not yet gifted one thousand cows throw your staff and the cows on the space your staff covers will be yours
bewildered trijata swiftly tightened up his upper garment around his waist set the direction for his staff and hurled it with all his might
the staff he hurled crossed the bank of the river sarayu and fell near a bull in the midst of a thousands cows
the virtuous rama embraced trijata and despatched all the cattle extending up to the bank of sarayu to his hermitage
afterwards rama sought to placate trijata that descendant of ganga saying this was a joke do not be angry
your power is unsurpassable and to ascertain this i incited you to do this act if there is anything else ask for it
truly speaking there is no limit to seeking wealth my wealth is specifically meant for brahmins by distributing all the wealth earned by me i get pleasure and renown
thereafter that great sage trijata along with his wife immensely happy to receive multitudes of cows pronounced blessings on the magnanimous rama for glory power pleasure and prosperity
prompted by the deserving words of acclaim from his friends rama distributed with joy and without delay the entire wealth earned by him through dharma
after giving away plenty of wealth to brahmins in charity rama and lakshmana along with sita set out to see their father king dasaratha
the pair of dazzling weapons held by rama and lakshmana looked splendid decorated with flower garlands by sita
the rich climbed their palaces and mansions terraces of sevenstoried buildings and watched them sadly
the streets were so thronged with multitudes of citizens that they were impassable therefore people felt miserable and ascended their mansions and gazed at rama
seeing rama walking without the royal umbrella people were very much shocked they expressed their reaction in so many words
whenever rama went out powerful army of four divisions used to follow him today he is walking alone followed by lakshmana and sita
rama who enjoyed the comforts of affluence gratifies those who have desires out of veneration for righteousness he does not want to prove his father false to his promise
it was not possible even for the creatures wandering in the sky birds to have a glimpse of sita before now passersby walking the highway can behold her
sita who used to apply fragrant unguents and smear the body with redsandal cream will now be exposed to the rain the heat and the cold which will quickly discolour her body
surely king dasaratha possessed of an evil spirit spoke the way he did today otherwise should a king banish his beloved son
even a son who is bereft of virtues cannot be banished what to say about rama who by good conduct alone has conquered the world
harmlessness compassion learning good conduct restraint of senses and selfcontrol all these six qualities adorn rama the greatest among men
therefore people are deeply pained to see rama afflicted they look like aquatic creatures in summer when the water dries up
just as severed at the root an entire tree along with its fruits and flowers is destroyed similarly the whole world gets afflicted when rama the ruler of the world comes to harm
effulgent rama personifies the essence of dharma he is the root of the tree of humanity the other people are connected with this tree like flowers fruit leaves and branches
let all of us without delay along with our wives and relations follow rama like lakshmana wherever he goes
deserting our gardens fields and houses and experiencing the same joy and sorrow of the virtuous rama we shall follow him
let kaikeyi take possession of our deserted and dilapidated homes with ruined courtyards which seem as though struck by calamities they are drained of wealth and foodgrains covered with dust and abandoned by the gods there is no water or smoke from kitchen they are infested with rats they stand unswept there foodgrains lie around ratholes and broken earthenwares lie scattered there are no offerings no sacrifices no recitation of sacred hymns no libations and no invocations
since the scion of the raghu race is going to the forest let that forest itself be our city and let the city deserted by us become the forest
let all the fanged creatures leave their lairs birds and animals the mountain slopes lions and elephants their haunts due to the fear caused by our presence and occupy the city left by us on seeing us deserting
let kaikeyi along with her son and her relatives acquire that country which will be inhabited by birds and animals living on grass fruits and flesh withdrawn we shall happily live in the forest along with rama
such were the various words uttered by the people even after hearing them his ramas mind remained unmoved from his resolve
dutiful rama endowed with the prowess of an intoxicated elephant approached the residence of his father that resembled from a distance the peak of mount kailasa in splendour
rama entered the royal palace guarded by welltrained warriors and not from very far saw sumantra who stood a picture of dejection
even after observing the people in grief rama did not reveal his sorrowful feelings bound by duty he went in as if with a smile to see his father
seeing sumantra stricken with grief for the first time the magnanimous rama scion of the ikshvaku dynasty on the way to the forest waited there for his father to be informed of his arrival
rama lover of righteousness determined to go to the forest in obedience to his fathers command said to sumantra inform the king of my arrival     thus ends the thirtythird sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
let my father be informed of my arrival said the lotuseyed darkcomplexioned venerable peerless rama to the charioteer
at the command of rama charioteer sumantra whose senses were overwhelmed with grief quickly entered the apartment of the king and found him heaving sighs
he saw the lord of the world dasaratha dull like the sun in eclipse like the fire covered with ashes like a tank with its water dried up
seeing the king brooding over rama in an extremely agitated state the sagacious charioteer approached him with folded hands
at first greeting the king with the words victory be yours the charioteer trembling with fear gently said in a feeble voice
your son rama the best of men having given away his entire wealth in charity to brahmins and to all the dependents is waiting at the entrance
o lord of the world behold him embellished with all princely virtues like the sun encircled with its rays now leaving for the forest
that truthful and virtuous king dasaratha who was deep like the ocean and free from mud pure like the sky replied
o sumantra bring all my consorts who are here in the company of all my wives i desire to give audience to virtuous rama
o venerable ones king dasaratha summons you go there without delay said sumantra to the kings consorts after crossing the inner apartment
thus addressed by sumantra in accordance with the kings order all the women went to their husbands palace
thereafter kausalya surrounded by three hundred and fifty ladies who were faithful to their vows reached there slowly with their eyes turned copperred in grief
usher in my son rama o sumantra said the lord of the world king dasaratha to the charioteer on seeing his wives arrive
then the charioteer fetched rama lakshmana and sita and advanced towards the king without delay
when the king saw from a distance his son coming with folded hands he surrounded by the ladies and tormented with grief stood up
at the sight of rama the lord of men king dasaratha tortured with grief immediately ran towards him but before he could reach him fell unconscious on the floor
rama and the mighty warrior lakshmana quickly reached the king who lay as though he had lost his senses due to grief
all on a sudden there arose from the mouths of a thousand women of the palace cries of alas alas rama mingled with the tinkling sounds of their ornaments
thereafter rama and lakshmana assisted by sita lifted him wailing in their arms and laid him on a couch
after the king regained his consciousness in a moment rama with folded hands said to him who was immersed in a sea of sorrow
o great king i am asking leave of you for you are lord of all of us i am set to depart for the dandaka forest see me off in a cheerful mood
allow lakshmana and sita to follow me into the forest i tried to dissuade them with a number of reasons but they did not agree
discard your grief and like brahma the creator allow lakshmana sita and me all of us your subjects o respector of men
on seeing rama unruffled waiting for his permission to proceed to the forest the lord of the earth king dasaratha said
i have been deluded by kaikeyi into bestowing boons imprison me and be now king of ayodhya o scion of the raghu dynasty
thus spoken to by the king rama skilled in speech and upholder of righteousness replied to his father with folded palms
you will remain the lord of this earth for a thousand years to come o king as for me i will dwell in the forest do not deviate from truth on my account
having fulfilled the vow on the completion of fourteen years of wandering in the forest i shall come back to touch your feet o lord of men
the king who was bound by the cord of truth and instigated by kaikeyi said wailing in distress
go my dear child wish you wellmay your path be auspicious free from obstacles and fear from any quarters come back after fulfilment of the pledge
o my beloved son o delight of the raghus you are devoted to truth and duty it is difficult to dissuade you from your resolve
o son by all means do not go now today tonight give me at least one day more to see by with you to my satisfaction
stay tonight in the company of your mother and me with all our desire satisfied you can set out tomorrow at the appropriate time
o my son o descendant of the raghus you are called upon to accomplish by all means a very difficult task for the sake of my pleasure you are forsaking your dear ones and going to the desolate forest
i swear by truth o my beloved son that your departure to the forest is in no way a pleasure to me with a hidden motive this woman who is like fire concealed by ashes has duped me
instigated by this kaikeyi the destroyer of traditions of the race i have been deceived for which you wish to pay
it is not a great surprise that you o my son being the eldest want to make your father free from a false promise
rama and lakshmana were sad to hear the words of their anguished father rama replies
who will give me the merit of propriety i earn today therefore i want to depart today discarding all my desires
the kingdom abdicated by me with all its people its wealth and foodgrains may be bestowed on bharata
my decision to go to the forest remains unchanged o bestower of boons o king honour to the last word the boons you had granted kaikeyi and adhere to truth
as already said i shall dwell in the forest for fourteen years with forest rangers in obedience to your commands
do not brood bestow the kingdom on bharata i do not have any desire for the kingdom or pleasure nothing is dearer to me than compliance with your order o delight of the raghu race
let your grief go do not shed tears the indomitable ocean lord of rivers is never perturbed
i desire no kingdom no comfort not this earth nor any pleasure nor heaven nor even life
i wish you o best of men to uphold truth and not falsehood i swear this in your presence in the name of truth and on my merits acquired
it is not possible for me o father to stay here for a moment any longer restrain your grief there can be no change in my resolve o king
o rama go to the forest kaikeyi had said and i have given her word i would go i must fulfil my promise
do not worry o lord we will enjoy our stay in the peaceful forest full of deer and resounding with the chirpings of various birds
father is divine even for the gods as cited in scriptures therefore looking upon father as my god i will carry out his words o father
i shall return after fourteen years have passed o best among men you will see me back give up this grief
when you o tiger among men are required as king to pacify those whose throats are choked with tears why this change in you
i am renouncing this city kingdom and this entire earth and let all this be conferred on bharata in obedience to your order i shall go and live in the forest for a long time
i am leaving behind o king this auspicious land with its welllaid boundaries mountain ranges cities and forests which bharata alone should rule let it happen the way you have said
o king my mind derives no happiness from great enjoyment or personal comfort as it does from carrying out your order this is corroborated by the wise your grief relating to filfilment of the vow on mt account will be dispelled o sinless one
o sinless one by associating you with falsehood i will neither seek this eternal kingdom nor objects of desires nor objects of happiness nor maithili nor even my life i only wish that your vow comes true
entering the forest full of various kinds of trees i shall be happy to view the mountains rivers and the lakes and to eat fruits and roots hence do not grieve
the king immersed in anguish and distressed with tears of grief embraced his son and then fell down unconscious on the floor and lay motionless
thereupon all the queens except kaikeyi wailed loudly sumantra too cried and fell unconscious the entire palace cried alas alas      thus ends the thirtyfourth sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
overcome with anger charioteer sumantra started shaking his head and sighing off and on crushing his palms and grinding his teeth his eyes turned red due to anger overcome with a sudden ominous grief the complexion of his face turned red sumantra understood the mind of dasaratha with sharp arrows of words as if piercing the heart of kaikeyi he denounced her in exceptionally harsh words which like thunderbolt cut her to the quick
o kaikeyi you have forsaken king dasaratha your husband and the lord of this entire world consisting of the movable and the immovable immovable and movable world there is nothing in this world which you are notcapable of doing
king dasaratha is invincible like indra unshakeable like a mountain and unperturbable like the ocean by causing grief to him through your action i feel you are killing your husband inch by inch i think you are ultimately destroying your own race
do not have contempt for dasaratha who is your husband nourisher and bestower of boons for a wife the desire of her husband is considered worthier than ten million sons
after the death of the king the princes will obtain the kingdom according to seniority why do you want to break this tradition in the case of rama the lord of the ikshvaku dynasty
let your son bharata be king and rule the earth all of us will go whereever rama goes
now by your act you intend to transgress the bounds of traditioncode of conduct no brahmin shall ever dwell in your country
all of us certainly will follow the path pursued by rama abandoned by relatives brahmins and virtuous men for all times what pleasure will you derive by your lust for this kingdom o kaikeyi why do you intend to trangress the limits of honour
it is a wonder that while bent upon banishing rama you are not destroyed by frightening fire created by great brahmarsis crying shame shame
by axing a mango tree and growing a nimba in its place and sprinkling it with milk one does not get sweet fruit
your nature corresponds to your mothers so i think honey will not flow from a nimba tree is a wellknown saying in this world
we have heard in the past about the evil stubborn nature of your mother once a bestower of boons conferred an extraordinary boon on your father by virtue of which he could tell the sounds of all living beings he also understood the language of all crookedly moving creatures
then one day near his bed your highly brilliant father laughed repeatedly over what an ant or a bird said for he knew the meaning from its sound
this incensed your mother who seeking the noose of death asked him o handsome king i intend to know the cause of your laughter
o queen if i disclose it then i will undoubtedly die that very movement replied the king to his wife
then your mother said to your father whether you live or die tell me the cause you are laughing at me
hearing the words of his beloved king of kekaya related the entire matter as it happened concerning the conferor of boons
that holy man who had granted the boon to the king had said let her die or destroy herself but do not disclose the cause of your laughter
happy to hear these words your father sent away your mother and moved about like kubera
o evilminded one you too are following the path of wickedness forcing the king infatuated with you to act unrighteously
the generally accepted saying in this world that sons resemble the father and daughters the mother appears true to me today
do not be like your mother accept what the king says abide by his wishes be his saviour
instigated by the wicked do not attribute unrighteousness to your husband who is equal to indra in brilliance and is the sustainer of this world
the lotuseyed sinless and prosperous king dasaratha o devi will not render false the promise given you he will fulfil it in another form
let his eldest son rama valiant generous skilful dutiful and protector of this world be consecrated
o devi if rama goes to the forest leaving his father the king you will be squarely blamed by the people of the world
therefore let rama potect this kingdom be relieved of mental afflictions there is no other person in this excellent city more competent than rama to rule this kingdom
if rama is installed as heirapparent king dasaratha the great archer will retire to the forest for carrying out austerities following ancient customs
afflicted on account of the promise he had made dasaratha descendant of the ikshvakus heaved deep sighs again and again and with his eyes full of tears uttered these words to sumantra
o sumantra arrange immediately four divisions of the army wellequipped with precious stones to escort rama in his journey to the forest
let the sweettongued courtesans opulent merchants with well spreadout merchandise make the army of my son graceful
main weapons citizens bodyguards carts wanderers in the forest and fowlers wellacquainted with the forest shall follow rama
hunting the elephants and antelopes drinking forest honey beholding several rivers on the way rama will not recollect the kingdom
let the entire contents of my granary and treasury follow rama wherever he lives in the desolate forest
performing sacrifices in the holy places and liberally giving appropriate gifts rama will live happily in the forest in the company of sages
while mightyarmed bharata will rule ayodhya rama be furnished with all objects of enjoyment
while dasaratha was saying these words kaikeyi was gripped by fear and her face looked pale even her voice got choked
the dejected and frightened kaikeyi with a dry countenance looked at the king and said
o virtuous king bharata will not take charge of the kingdom abandoned by men drained of wealth and incapable of being enjoyed like wine with its essence evaporated
king dasaratha heard the terribly cruel and shameless words of that largeeyed kaikeyi and said
o brutal kaikeyi you fastened me to the yoke and when i am drawing forward why do you beat me o vile woman why did you not prevent me in the beginning itself
at these wrathful words of dasaratha kaikeyi with redoubled fury replied to the king
in your own dynasty king sagara prevented his wellknown eldest son asamanjasa from enjoying the kingdom rama also should depart in the same manner
hearing the words of kaikeyi dasaratha could say only shame all the people felt ashamed but kaikeyi could not understand this
that wickedminded asamanjasa used to seize the children playing on the street and amuse himself by hurling them in the waters of river sarayu
watching it all the enraged citizens said to the king o enhancer of the prosperity of the kingdom either you choose asamanjasa or us
the king then asked them why this fear and the citizens responded
that insane asamanjasa while throwing our children who were playing around into sarayu river in his insanity derived incomparable pleasure
that king sagara heard the words of the citizens and with the intention of doing good to them banished that malevolent son
then the father made him and his wife climb a carriage with the clothes they had at the time on them and at once ordered his servants to banish him for life
like an evildoer wandering about in different directions holding a spade and a basket in his hand he went about digging the impenetrable mountains
highly righteous king sagara thus banished his son what sin has rama committed to secure a similar banishment
we see no fault in rama unlike the stain in the moon it is difficult to find any blemish in him
o kaikeyi speak truly if you find any fault in this scion of the raghu race rama then he will be exiled
the act of banishment of an innocent one walking the righteous path is like destroying the brilliance of indra by restraining his righteousness
o devi there is no use obstructing ramas prosperity o one with an auspicious countenance save yourself from the censure of the world
having heard siddhartha the king stricken with grief said to kaikeyi in a gradually feeble voice
o kaikeyi of vicious behaviour you do not aceept even the words of siddhartha you woman of wicked acts having adopted vile ways and abjured the right path cannot know what is good either for you or for me
abandoning this kingdom these comforts and this wealth i shall follow rama enjoy the kingdom for a long time happily along with king bharata     thus ends the thirtysixth sarga of ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
on hearing the minister rama who knew how to be polite spoke these words to dasaratha humbly
o king giving up pleasures and attachments altogether i am going to live on whatever is available in the forest what is the use of followers
having given away the best of elephants will any one be interested in the rope tied to its girth why should one have any attachment for the rope after he has given up the elephant
o best among the virtuous o lord of the world i do not have any use for this army i am giving away everything to bharata bring the bark only
i am going to the forest to live there for fourteen years bring me two things a basket and a crowbar
thereupon in the assembly of people without any sense of shame kaikeyi herself brought the bark robes and said to the son of the raghus rama wear it
the tiger among men rama received the bark robes from kaikeyi and putting off the fine apparel wore the robes of an ascetic
lakshmana also removed his auspicious raiment in front presence of his father and accepted put on the robes of an ascetic
then sita in silk clothes glanced at the bark robes meant for her to wear and was frightened like a doe seeing a fowlers snare
sita of auspicious nature who knew her duties and understood righteousness took the garments made of kusa grass from kaikeyi with a sense of abashment her eyes suffused with tears she said to her husband who was the very image of the king of gandharvas
sita unacquainted with wearing bark robes asked rama perplexed how do the sages who live in the forest wear bark garment
the daughter of janaka placed one end of the garment round her neck and held the other in her hand and stood ashamed as she did not know what to do next
rama foremost among protectors of righteousness came forward quickly and fastened the bark himself over her silk garment
beholding rama fastening the bark garment on sita the women of the inner apartment shed tears from their eyes
profoundly distressed they said to rama glowing with burning lustre o dear no one has ordered this highminded sita to dwell in the forest
in obedience to the words of your father o lord you are going to the forest till you return please allow us to have her sitas audience
go o son to the forest with lakshmana as your companion but this auspicious sita will not be able to live in the jungle like a hermit
do accede to our prayer let lovely sita stay with us as you o son faithful to your duty will not like to remain here
while rama was listening to such words uttered by them he got the bark robes fastened round sita who was of similar nature
when sita wore the bark garments vasistha the kings preceptor who was watching this restrained her sita and said to kaikeyi
you are exceeding all limits of decency o kaikeyi your motive is evil you are a disgrace to the race you have deceived the king and your behaviour does not conform to the standards of righteousness
you are devoid of good conduct o kaikeyi divine sita need not go to the forest remaining here she should occupy the royal throne of rama
for every householder his wife is the soul since sita is the soul of rama she can rule this earth
the guardians of the harem its patron king dasaratha with his retinue and the people of this city will go wherever rama lives with his wife
wandering in the forest and wearing bark satrughna and bharata will live in the company of their elder brother rama in the jungle
intent upon doing harm to the people with your vile behaviour you alone rule this kingdom full of trees and deserted by men
that is not a kingdom where rama does not rule if rama lives in the forest that shall be the kingdom
if bharata is truly born to the king he will not rule the kingdom which has not been bestowed on him wholeheartedly by his father nor will he live like a son to you
even if you were to fly from earth to sky bharata who knows the traditions of his fathers dynasty will not act otherwise
therefore by greedily guarding your sons interest you are doing him harm there is none in this world who will not follow rama
today you shall see o kaikeyi flocks of cattle elephants deer and birds following rama even the trees bending towards him
o kaikeyi remove those bark robes and bestow on your daughterinlaw precious ornaments she was not ordained to wear the bark vaisishta saying so prevented sita from wearing that garment
o kaikeyi you asked that rama only should dwell in the forest wearing bark robes therefore let sita adorn her body daily while she lives in the forest with rama
equipped with excellent chariots attendants garments and all other needs let the princess sita go while seeking boons you did not include sita
though vasistha endowed with matchless power the preceptor of the king and foremost among the brahmins thus expressed himself sita was not willing to swerve from her resolve in order to serve her beloved husband     thus ends the thirtyseventh sarga of ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
beholding sita who was wearing a bark garment like one without a support though having a husband all the people cried bitterly exclaiming o dasaratha fie on you
hearing that tumult the distressed dasaratha lost faith in his own life and in his righteousness
the descendant of the ikshvakus dasaratha heaving hot sighs said to his wife o kaikeyi sita does not deserve to go to the forest in garment of kusa grass
sita a delicate young princess accustomed to comforts is not fit to dwell in the forest this is what my preceptor has truly spoken
sita daughter of janaka the greatest among kings stands amidst people wearing bark garment like an ascetic with her senses switched off to whom and what harm has she done
let the daughter of janaka take off her bark garments this is not the promise i had made to you earlier let the princess happily go to the forest adorned with all jewels and with all other necessities
by giving this cruel promise through importunity i have rendered myself unfit to live this promise was made as a childs play and it now destroys me like a bamboo destroyed by its own flowers
o sinful woman o wretch rama might have done something unbecoming to you but what offence has sita committed
what wrong has the daughter of janaka largeeyed like a doe so gentle and worthy of compassion done to you
ramas exile o wicked woman is enough for you what are you committing further heinous crimes for
i have heard you o devi speaking to rama when he came here in connection with the coronation i promised you to that extent only
having exceeded all that you want to behold sita in bark garment and thereby wish for hell
the king could not see any end to his lamentation immersed in the grief of separation from his son and deeply tormented he fell down on the ground
rama who was about to leave for the forest addressed his father who sat with his head bent once again
o righteous father o king my aged and illustrious mother kausalya possesses neither a mean character nor does she blame you
o bestower of boons separated from me and unaccustomed to suffering she will be plunged into an unforeseen ocean of sorrow you should pay her greater attention
let her not grieve on account of her son o venerable father if she who deserves compassion is honoured by you she will live
you are powerful like indrayou should act accordingly so that my mother who has a possesive feeling towards her son should not due to emaciation go to the abode of yama after my departure for the forest      thus ends the thirtyeighth sarga of ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
after hearing rama and beholding him in the robes of an ascetic dasaratha and his wives fell unconscious with his body and mind afflicted with grief dasaratha could not look rama in the face nor could he make a reply
the mightyarmed king lost consciousness for a moment and in grief lamented brooding only over rama
in the past i must have separated many from their children or harmed many living beings that is why i think this calamity has befallen me
unless the destined hour arrives life does not leave the body therefore even though i am tormented by kaikeyi and even after seeing my son standing before me bright like fire taking off his fine clothes and wearing the robes of an ascetic my end does not come
only because of kaikeyi who resorted to this deception in pursuit of selfish ends so many people are made to suffer
having uttered these words and muttering o rama only once his vision blurred by tears he could speak no more
regaining his senses in a moment the king with eyes filled with tears said to sumantra
harness the finest horses to the chariot suitable for the journey drive this magnanimous rama to a place outside the city and come back
that the pious and heroic son is banished by his parents to the forest is i think the reward to the virtuous for his virtues
in obedience to the words of the king sumantra promptly harnessed the horses to a welldecorated chariot and brought it there
with folded palms sumantra informed the prince that a chariot decked in gold and harnessed with excellent horses is ready
the king who was aware of the right place and time summoned hurriedly the treaury officer who was firm and honest and said to him
assess the needs for number of years the princess of videha sita is going to be in the forest and fetch her quickly highly valuable garments and excellent ornaments
ordered thus by the king the officer went to the treasury collected all the things and presented them to sita
that princess of noble birth from videha adorned her beautiful limbs with the sparkling ornaments and got ready to depart for the forest
welladorned sita illumined the palace like the rising sun lighting up the sky at dawn
kausalya sitas motherinlaw took her in her arms embraced her kissed her on the forehead and said to her who conducted herself without evoking any pity
those women who although always gratified do not follow their husband when they fall into misfortune are regarded as unfaithful
though they have enjoyed all pleasures with their husbands earlier they censure them in the wake of the slightest trouble or even abandon them this is the nature of women
evilminded young ladies are infidels they are of perverted nature they are inscrutable in an instant they lose their love for their husbands
neither family traditions nor benefits received nor education nor affection nor gifts nor even accumulated wealth attract womens hearts their minds are unstable indeed
but for those virtuous women whose minds are fixed in chastity truth scriptures and stability the husband occupies a distinguished place and is considered supremely holy
you must not underestimate my son in his exile you must treat him as your god whether he is wealthy or not
sita who understood the import of these words which were in conformity with dharma and artha repiled to her motherinlaw facing her with folded palms
i shall do exactly all that the venerable motherinlaw instructs me i have heard it earlier and have fully understood as to how i should conduct myself towards my husband
my worshipful motherinlaw should not equate me with wicked people women i cannot swerve from the path of virtue like radiance which never leaves the moon
a veena lute sans strings cannot be played a chariot without wheels cannot move similarly a woman without her husband finds no happiness even though she has one hundred sons
while the happiness that the father mother and son give is limited a husband gives unlimited happiness which wife will not worship such a husband
instructed about my obligations by an eminent lady her mother imbued with these ideals how can i o exalted one underestimate him my husband for a woman the husband is a god indeed
listening to the heartstirring words of sita kausalya with her heart so pure burst instantaneously into tears of joy and grief
most virtuous rama approached his mother that highly revered lady among all his mothers and with folded hands said
o mother do not grieve look after my father my stay in the forest will soon come to an end
fourteen years will pass off like a nights sleep you will see me come home safe and sound surrounded by my friends
speaking thus to his mother with highly polished words he then turned his gaze at his other three hundred and fifty mothers
to all the mothers who stood deeply distressed with grief the son of dasaratha spoke with folded hands these words suffused with virtue
if i have been harsh towards you on account of our living together or through ignorance may you forgive me i now seek leave of you all
all the women with their senses afflicted by grief heard the virtuous and wellbalanced words of the scion of the raghu race
while rama said so there arose a loud cry of the wives of the king like the cry of the female herons
dasarathas palace which reverberated like the rumblings of the cloud with the sounds of drums and other musical instruments earlier now immensely griefsticken and trapped in calamity is filled with wailings and lamentations      thus ends the thirtyninth sarga of ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
thereafter sita rama and lakshmana with folded palms in a forlom state touched the feet of the king and circumambulated him
taking leave of dasaratha the righteous descendant of the raghus rama along with sita paid obeisance to his mother kausalya who was afflicted with deep grief
immediately following rama his brother lakshmana also paid obeisance to kausalya and thereafter held the feet of his own mother sumitra
while the mightyarmed lakshmana paid her homage sumitra wailed kissed him on his forehead wished him well and said
although deeply attached to your beloved ones o son you are born to dwell in the forest never be inattentive towards your brother rama who is on his way to the forest
rama is your refuge in times of adversity or prosperity o sinless one to be obedient to the eldest brother is the duty of virtuous men in this world
charity initiation at sacrifices and yielding life in battles are the befitting ancient traditions prevailing in your race
having said this to lakshmana sumitra again and again said to her beloved rama who was fully prepared go go
to lakshmana she said regard rama as dasaratha sita as me and the forest as ayodhya my child go in peace
then sumantra who knows the ways of politeness and humility spoke to rama with folded hands as matali did to indra
o illustrious prince wish you well mount the chariot i shall convey you speedily whereever you want
you have been directed by kaikeyi to live in the forest for fourteen years accordingly you must now commence counting those years as directed
sita of lovely limbs decorated herself and with a cheerful mind boarded the chariot which was shining like the sun
thereafter rama and lakshmana also boarded that chariot decorated with gold and shining like blazing fire
fatherinlaw dasaratha gave clothes and ornaments on the assessment of the number of years sita was going to spend in the forest with her husband
so also dasaratha secured a multitude of weapons shields and protective leathercoverings for hands and placed them at the centre of the chariot for use by the brothers when sumantra ensured that sita rama and lakshmana boarded the chariot he briskly hastened the horses which were as speedy as the wind
having seen rama set out for the great forest for a long period the city was stilled and men were enervated
the city was distressed and flurried by the intoxicated elephants provoked by the mighty sound of the tinkling of bells and the neighing of the horses
thereafter the extremely afflicted people of the city including young and old alike ran towards rama like men oppressed with heat running for water
all the people hanging from the chariot from behind and by the sides heaving deeply their faces covered with tears thus addressed to sumantra
o charioteer control the reins of the horses and go slow so that we may look at the face of rama for soon we will not be able to see him
alas the heart of kausalya whose son rama resembles the offspring of the gods does not break even though he is going to the forest undoubtedly it must be made of iron
sita deeply attached to her duty and with her desire fulfilled is following her husband like a shadow just as the sunlight which never leaves mount meru
with your desires fulfilled o lakshmana you will attend to your godlike brother who always speaks pleasant words
the very fact that you are following rama is a great achievement and a great fortune for you this in fact is the way to heaven
speaking thus the people following their beloved rama the delight of the ikshvaku dynasty were not able to bear restrain the tears flowing from their eyes
i wish to see my beloved son said the king with a sense of desolation and emerged surrounded by forlorn women from the palace
he heard the women crying loudly in front like wailings of cowelephants when their bull elephant is captured
the king born in the race of kakutstha though bright looked dull then like the full moon eclipsed by rahu
the son of dasaratha glorious rama of inconceivable courage exhorted the charioteer to drive the chariot fast
urged by rama to drive fast on the one hand and by the citizens to stay on the other the charioteer could do neither on the way
as the mightyarmed rama was going away the dust raised from the earth subsided with the tears falling from the citizens eyes
at the time of ramas departure the insensate city was drenched with tears of the deeply afflicted people crying alas alas
tears born of anguish fell from the eyes of women just as waterdrops fall from lotuses shaken by the movements of fishes
having seen the city people absorbed in one single thought the prosperous king griefstricken fell down on the ground like a tree severed at its root
when the people saw the king enfeebled by deep grief they raised an uproar behind ramas chariot
some among them wailed oh rama while some others cried oh mother of rama by crying loudly they made the women in the inner apartment cry too
when rama glanced back he saw his mother and father trailing behind him on the highway with an agitated and dejected mind
like a fastened foal cannot see its mother rama restrained by bonds of duty could not see his parents clearly
seeing his parents who were worthy of riding a chariot now going on foot who were accustomed to comforts and did not deserve any suffering rama urged his charioteer to drive fast
rama the best among men could not like an elephant tormented by the goad endure that pitiful sight of his father and mother
ramas mother ran after the chariot like an affectionate cow running towards the shed to join its fastened calf
while kausalya was weeping and running after the chariot crying o rama o sita o lakshmana shedding tears for them rama repeatedly glanced at her who was twisting and bending as if in a dancing pose
the king cried stay stay while rama said go on go on sumantras mind was caught as if in between two wheels
when the king reproaches you for not stopping the chariot you can say i could not hearprolonging agony is sinful said rama to sumantra
obeying the command of rama and after taking leave of the people sumantra hastened the horses although they were galloping
the kings men returned with rama circumambulated on the plane of their minds but from their minds they could not hold back their tears grief
we should not follow over a long distance those we wish to return said the ministers to king dasaratha
dasaratha and his wives overcome with grief heard their words steeped in virtue wisdom the king stood there with his perspiring body and melancholic appearance fixing his gaze on his son     thus ends the fortieth sarga of ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
when rama the foremost men was departing with folded palms there arose a huge cry of distress from the inner apartment of ladies
rama was a refuge and a protector to all the people who were defenceless weak and miserable where is such a protector going now said the people
where is he who even if reviled never gets angry never does acts that provoke anger pacifies those who are enraged and shares the sorrows of others going now
where is he that effulgent magnanimous one who treated us with the same respect as he treated his mother kausalya going now
tormented by kaikeyi the king ordered him to go to the forest where is he who happened to be the protector of the people of this world going now
alas the king must be devoid of any sense as he is sending away rama who is dear to the world is righteous and truthful to dwell in the forest
so wept aloud the anguished wives of the king like cows separated from their calves
upon hearing the dreadful wailing from the inner apartments of the palace the king already devasted at the separation from his son grew even more distressed
the sacred fire in agnihotra sacrifices was not invoked householders did not cook their food the people did not attend to their daily chores and the sun set
elephants dropped their morsel of food cows did not suckle their calves even the mothers were not pleased with their firstborn sons
the constellation trishanku the planets mars jupiter mercury and other fierce planets took their position near the moon
the stars were shorn of their radiance the brilliance of the planets diminished shrouded in smoke the visakha constellation appeared in the sky
after rama left for the forest dark clouds appeared in the sky like the waves of the great ocean uplifted by the speed of the wind which shook the city
as if covered with darkness all the cardinal points became agitated no planet no star nor was anything any heavenly body shining in the sky
all of a sudden the people of the city became miserable no one was interested in eating and enjoying life
all the citizens of ayodhya afflicted with a series of grief and heaving deep sighs ceaselessly bewailed at the sight of the lord of the world dasaratha
the faces of the people on the highway were turbid with tears none looked happy all were plunged in sorrow
the breeze did not blow cool no more did the moon look pleasant the sun did not give warmth to the world all the world was agitated
mothers stopped thinking of their sons and husbands of their wives brothers were no longer interested in each other every one deserted every one and thought only of rama
all the friends of rama were stupefied afflicted with the burden of sorrow they did not leave their bed
without magnanimous rama ayodhya thereafter looked like the earth along with its mountains bereft of indra afflicted with fear and sorrow it started shaking dreadfully with the sounds of horses elephants and warriors      thus ends the fortyfirst sarga of ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
as long as the dust raised by the wheels of the chariot of rama who was departing to the forest was visible dasaratha the best of the ikshvakus could not withdraw his eyes from rama
so long as king dasaratha was able to see his exceedingly virtuous and beloved son rama it appeared that his body kept rising from the earth to have a sight of his son
when the king could no longer see even the dust he fell on the ground despondent and grief stricken
kausalya reached for the right hand of dasaratha to raise him up and kaikeyi the beloved mother of bharata reached for his left
the king endowed with rectitude virtue and also humility stared at and said to kaikeyi with pain
o kaikeyi you are a woman of evil conduct do not touch my body i do not wish to see you you are not my wife or my relation
your dependents have nothing to do with me nor i with them i denounce you since you are a selfseeker without any sense off righteousness
i renounce the relationship established with you through marriage by taking your hand and circumambulating the fire both in this world and in the next
if bharata feels pleased to secure this imperishable kingdom then may his obsequial offerings at my funeral not reach me
then kausalya emaciated due to sorrow lifted the king who was thoroughly coated with dust and returned to the palace
that virtuous dasaratha recalling the sight of his son with the robes of an ascetic burned with remorse as if he had intentionally slain a brahmin or placed his hand in fire
turning back again and again at the trail of ramas chariot the grieving king appeared lustreless like the sun in eclipse
the griefstricken king began to lament thinking of his beloved son and suddenly realizing that his son had crossed the limits of the city said
i can see the marks of the hooves of the splendid horses carrying my son on the highway but not that magnanimous rama
rama the best of all my sons who smeared with sandalpaste and fanned by graceful women used to sleep with his head on comfortable cushions will surely from now on lie down somewhere at the foot of a tree his head pillowed upon a piece of wood or stone
that unfortunate rama having been covered with dust will get up from the ground sighing like a bull elephant rising from mount prasravana
surely the forestrovers will be gazing upon the longarmed rama protector of the world as he rises from the ground and wanders in the jungle unprotected
sita beloved daughter of janaka who is accustomed to comforts will now wander in the forest troubled by piercing thorns
sita who knows not the forest will now live in terror listening to the hairraising horrible roars of wild animals
o kaikeyi your desire is fulfilled rule the kingdom as a widow without rama the best of men i dont desire to live
thus the king who looked like one after the inauspicious funeral bath surrounded by streams of people entered the most beautiful city ayodhya which portended misfortune
there the mansions and squares on the highways were all deserted the temples and marketplaces were closed the people were weak fatigued and tormented with grief the highways were not much crowded having seen such a sight of the city on all sides lamenting and brooding over rama dasaratha entered his palace like the sun plunging into a cloud
the palace without rama lakshmana and sita stood like a vast unperturbed lake with serpents snatched away by suparna garuda
thereupon dasaratha lamenting with his throat choked addressed his attendants in a low feeble melancholic gentle voice
take me quickly to the apartment of ramas mother kausalya there is no other place where my heart can find solace
having heard the king the doorkeepers took him to the apartment of kausalya and there respectfully made him rest
his mind tossed restlessly although he entered kausalyas palace and climbed into the couch
to the king the palace deserted by his two sons and his daughterinlaw seemed like the sky without the moon
the valiant maharaja looked around that palace lifted up his arms and shouted in a loud voice oh scion of the raghus rama you have forsaken me
oh how fortunate are those best of men who will live until that time to see rama return and embrace him
in the middle of the night which for him felt like the night of death dasaratha said to kausalya thus
o kausalya my sight that had followed rama has not yet returned i cannot see you clearly please touch me with your hand
having seen the king in bed brooding over rama the queen kausalya sitting by his side sighed and lamented deeply anguished      thus ends the fortysecond sarga of ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
struck by the grief of her sons departure kausalya looked at the king who lay on the couch completely exhausted and said to him
moving crookedly like a snake kaikeyi has released her venom on rama the best among men now she will move about freely like a sheserpent that has cast off its slough
having banished rama she is now happy with her desires fulfilled and like a vicious serpent living in the house she will again frighten me
it would have been better had i offered her my son as a slave he would have lived on in the house by doing his duties and begging his food in the city
you have thrown away rama from his place as per the whim of kaikeyi like the share of offering meant for gods given away to rakshasas by the sacrificers on the new moon days
my mightyarmed son a great archer and a hero rama whose gait is like that of the king of elephants must be entering the forest along with his consort sita and lakshmana
you have banished them as per the desire of kaikeyi what will be their plight in the forest for they have never experienced any hardship earlier
deprived of all costly things they have been banished at the tender age of youth a time for enjoying their lives how will they lead a miserable life subsisting on fruits and roots
will there ever be that auspicious moment to end my sorrow when i can see rama here along with his wife and brother
when will the city of ayodhya attain that glory when having heard that both the brave brothers have come back the people will rejoice and fill it with uplifted banners
when will like the swelling sea on a full moon day the city hail the return of rama and lakshmana the best among men
when will the mightyarmed hero rama enter the city of ayodhya with sita in front in the chariot like a bull following the cow
when will the people in their thousands shower the parched grain on the highway when my sons rama and lakshmana subduers of enemies enter the city
when shall i see both of them wearing auspicious earrings and holding poweful weapons bows and swords high like two mountain peaks
when will i see them delightfully moving round the city with young brahmin girls offering them flowers and fruits
when will rama the knower of righteousness possessing the lustre of gods and fully mature in age and wisdom come back to me playfully like a threeyearold boy
o valiant one in my previous birth i must have undoubtedly hacked off the udders of cows when the calves were thirsting for milk from their mothers
o best of men i have been forcibly separated from my affectionate son by kaikeyi just like a cow from its calf by a lion
i cannot live without my only son who is adept in all scriptures and endowed with all virtues
without seeing my beloved son longarmed and mighty i have but little strength to live in this world
i am consumed by this blazing fire of grief caused by separation from my son like the earth scorched in summer by the sungod with his oppressive rays     thus ends the fortythird sarga of ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
while kausalya the best of women was thus lamenting virtuous sumitra spoke to her these righteous words
my venerable lady your son rama is the greatest among men and is endowed with every virtue why do you lament in this way why do you weep bitterly
in order to vindicate the words of his great and truthful father o noble ladyyour mighty son has renounced the kingdom and has gone to the forest he has stuck to the path so scrupulously followed by the wise the everlasting results of which can be fully realised in the world to come such a peerless son is never to be grieved over
blameless lakshmana compassionate to all beings has acted most nobly in this matter for the benefit of his great soul
the daughter of videha sita who was used to comforts has knowingly followed your virtuous son into the hardships of forest life
your allcompetent son who considers righteousness and truth as wealth is waving the flag of fame in this world what is that which your son did not gain
knowing ramas sterling purity and greatness the sun evidently dare not scorch his body with its rays
a pleasant yet moderately hot and cold breeze blowing through the woodlands will serve rama at all seasons
while that sinless rama sleeps at night the moon will comfort him by touching him with cool beams like a father embracing his son
to the mighty heroic rama that best of men brahmalike viswamitra has bequeathed many divine weapons seeing him slay timidhwajas son subahu lord of demons in the battle he will stay fearless in the forest relying on the strength of his own arms as though he were living in the palace
when enemies who are targets of his arrows are destoyed how can this earth not stay under the command of rama
on return from his sojourn in the forest rama endowed with splendour valour and a strength that brings wellbeing will quickly regain his kingdom
o devi rama is the sun light of the sun fire splendour of the fire master command of masters prosperity of the prosperous the fame of the famous forbearance of the forbearing god of the gods and supreme among all beings whether he dwells in the forest or in the city he has no demerit whatsoever
rama the best among men will soon be coronated with these three namely the earth the goddess of fortune and sita
when the people of ayodhya saw the godlike rama departing clad in robes of kusha and bark they were moved to tears of grief what is impossible for him who is unconquerable and whom sita like the goddess of fortune follows
what is impossible for rama ahead of whom moves lakshmana the best of archers weilding swords arrows and other weapons
i tell you the truth kausalya that you will see ramas return when the period of exile is complete hence give up your sorrow and delusion
o irreproachable and auspicious one you will see your son like the rising moon touching your feet with his head
soon you will see him enthrouned shining in full glory on his return from exile while tears of joy will flow from your eyes
desist from grief or tear for rama o devi nothing inauspicious will happen to him you will soon see your son along with sita and lakshmana
o sinless lady o queen when you are overcome by fear how can you console others
o kausalya with a son like rama you should not grieve there is none in this world superior to rama who stands steady in the path of virtue
like a flake of cloud in monsoon you are going to shed tears of joy soon seeing your son along with his friends bowing to you in reverence
your son bestower of boons will soon return to ayodhya and press your feet with his soft tender hands
while paying obeisance to you you will drench your brave son surrounded by friends with tears of joy like a mass of clouds drenching the mountain
irreproachable and skilful in the use of words queen sumitra of cheerful disposition fell silent after thus consoling ramas mother in various ways
on hearing the words of lakshmanas mother the grief in the heart of the queen kausalya mother of rama instantly disappeared like the autumnal cloud that holds but little rain      thus ends the fortyfourth sarga of ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
when the highsouled rama whose strength was his sense of truth set out for the forest the faithful people followed him
the king and the hosts of friends were forcibly sent back but they did not return they continued to follow the chariot of rama
the illustrious and virtuous rama was as dear to the inhabitants of ayodhya as the full moon
although entreated by his subjects not to go rama proceeded to the forest to make his fathers vow come true
looking at the people with love as if they were his own children and as though drinking them with his glances rama appealed to them
o citizens of ayodhya may the love and respect you have shown to please me be bestowed specially on bharata
bharata enhancer of the delight of kaikeyi possesses an auspicious character he will do for you everything appropriate agreeable and beneficial
though tender in age bharata is mature in intellect gentle valiant and virtuous he will dispel all your fears and act as a true protector
endowed with kingly qualities he is recognised as heirapparent therefore as i did all of you should obey the order of the king
if you desire to please me act in such a way that the king does not grieve after i have gone to the forest
the more the son of dasaratha rama committed to righteousness the more the subjects desired that he should be their king
rama along with lakshmana attracted the citydwellers who choked with tears were looking miserable it appeared they were bound with his virtues
those brahmins who were senior to him on three counts like age wisdom and spirtuality spoke to him from a distance with their heads shaking with age
o horses of noble breed turn back do not carry your master swiftyly any farther do good to him
all animals especially horses have a keen sense of hearing therefore having listened to our entreaty turn back
your master has a purity of heart he is righteous virtuous brave and firm in resolve carry him backward and not forward from the city into the forest
having seen the aged brahmins muttering pitiful lamentations in this manner rama immediately alighted from the chariot
then rama along with sita and lakshmana began walking on foot with slow steps towards the forest
rama a man of probity and compassion could not ride off in his chariot while those brahmins were trudging far behind
having seen rama thus going towards the forest those brahmins highly agitated and distressed said to him
this entire order of brahmins with the sacrificial fires on their hsoulders is following you their wellwisher
see these umbrellas acquired by us while performing vajapeya sacrifice are following you like the clouds at the end of the rainy season
you do not have a royal umbrella and you are scorched by the rays of the sun we will offer you shade with the umbrellas acquired during vajapeya sacrifice
o dear child our minds always pursue the study of vedic hymns for your sake now they are made to follow the life in the forest
the vedas are our greatest wealth and they reside in our hearts our wives protected by their fidelity shall stay at home
we are not going to revoke our decision we have made up our minds to follow you into the forest if you have no regard for this decision then who will adhere to the path of righteousness
o rama you are firm in your dutywe beseech you our heads bowed with swanwhite hair and soiled with dust to return to ayodhya
many of those brahmins who arrived here have commenced their sacrifices o dear child their consummation depends on your return
o rama all these living beings movable and immovable are devoted to you and are entreating you with devotion to return show consideration to those supplicants
although the trees uplifted by the speed of the wind intend to follow you their movement is stalled by their roots unable they appear to be weeping
even the birds instead of foraging for food are sitting motionless on the trees at one place they are imploring you you who are compassionate to all creatures to return to ayodhya
while those brahmins were thus crying out river tamasa came into view as if seeking rama to turn back to ayodhya
then sumantra also unyoked the fatigued horses from the chariot and quickly allowed them to roll and relax on the ground having made the horses drink and dip in water he released them for grazing not far from tamasa river     thus ends the fortyfifth sarga of ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
the scion of the raghus rama having taken shelter on the lovely bank of tamasa glanced at sita and said to lakshmana thus
o lakshmana this happens to be the first night of our exile you should not have any longing in your mind wish you well
look at the deserted forest the wild animals and birds have returned to their hideouts they fill the air with their cries
there is no doubt that now the men and women of ayodhya fathers capital city must be bewailing our departure
o best of men because of our many virtues the people of ayodhya are indeed loyal to the king to you to me and to satrughna and bharata too
what distresses me is the thought that both father and illustrious mother may become blind by repeated weeping over us
righteous bharata will indeed console parents with words in conformity with dharma artha and kama
as i reflect again and again on the benevolent nature of bharata there is no concern in me about my parents o lakshmana
you o lakshmana the best among men have done a good job by accompanying me otherwise assistance for sitas protection would have been sought necessary
o lakshmana i shall live this night on water alone i prefer it though various kinds of forest products are available
having said so to lakshmana he turned to sumantra to say o gentle friend tend the horses with care
as the sun was setting sumantra tethered the horses fed them with abundant fodder and sat close to them
then the charioteer worshipping the auspicious sandhya twilight and seeing the night approach made bed for rama and lakshmana
having seen the bed of leaves made ready on the bank of tamasa rama lay down there along with sita and lakshmana
having seen that his brother along with his wife had fallen asleep lakshmana narrated the many virtues of rama to sumantra
lakshmana continued to describe ramas virtues to the charioteer keeping awake that entire night on the bank of tamasa until the sun rose
rama spent the night with his subjects not very far from the bank of tamasa which was crowded with herds of cattle
on getting up the brilliant rama looked at his subjects and said to his brother lakshmana full of noble qualities
o lakshmana son of sumitra look at these people fast alseep under the trees out of affection for us they are even indifferent to their home
on seeing the peoples resolve to take us back it appears they are prepared to give up their lives rather than abandon their determination
while they are asleep we shall quickly mount the chariot and fearlessly proceed on the way
these loyal inhabitants of ayodhya the city of the ikshvakus will no more sleep again shelterd under the trees
the prince should deliver the citizens from the sufferings caused by themselves but should not make them suffer on their account
lakshmana said to rama who was the very image of like righteousness o wise one i like this proposal let us quickly mount the chariot
then glorious rama addressing sumantra said o master charioteer harness the chariot i shall let us quickly leave for the forest
thereupon the charioteer hurriedly harnessed the splendid horses to the chariot and informed rama with folded hands
o best among riders the chariot has been harnessed o mightyarmed one board it along with sita and lakshmana all the best
rama along with others mounted the chariot with his belongings crossed the rapidly flowing tamasa agitated with whirlpools
having crossed the river the mightyarmed and gracious rama proceeded on the auspicious and thornless highway arousing confidence even in the timid
with the intention of confusing the citizens rama said to the charioteer o sumantra having seated in the chariot proceed speedly for a while in northerly direction and again turn back the chariot accomplish this feat in such a manner that the citizens will not know where we have gone
the charioteer did as instructed by rama returned to him with the chariot and informed of its readiness
when rama and lakshmana perpetuaters of the raghu race along with sita were seated on the wellyoked chariot sumantra urged the horses to move
as it augurs well to travel north sumantra placed the chariot in that direction thereafter that great charioteer rama sita and lakshmana boarded the chariot and departed     thus ends the fortysixth sarga of ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
when the night advanced towards dawn the citizens were stunned not to see the scion of the raghus rama overwhelmed with sorrow they lost their senses
anguished and drenched with tears of grief they looked hither and thither but could not find even a trace of rama
those highminded people with sorrowful faces due to separation from sagacious rama expressed themselves in piteous words
fie on this sleep which robbed us of our senses we are unable to see now that broadchested and mightyarmed rama
how is it that the mightyarmed rama who never renders services done to him fruitless has deserted his devoted people and gone into exile
how could he the best among the kings of raghu dynasty who used to protect us as a father protects his own children go to the forest abandoning us
we all will die here we will go on the everlasting journey to death of what use is this life to us without rama
there are plenty of dry logs of wood we will prepare a pyre with them set fire to it and we all will enter it
what shall we say to the people how can we say we have conducted him to the forest that scion of the raghus that mightyarmed rama who is of gentle speech and free from malice
seeing us return without rama the women children and the aged of the city ayodhya will certainly feel miserable and cheerless
having left that city with the valiant and selfrestrained rama how can we now return without him
all of them with grief distressed and with their arms thrown up lamented like cows deprived of their calves
for a short while they followed the tracks of the chariot and after having gone a little distance they missed the way they were again submerged in deep sorrow
when they could not find the tracks of the chariot those highminded people turned back and said to themselves what is this we have been deceived by fate what are we to do now
thereafter all of them the virtuous people grieving their minds fatigued returned to ayodhya the same way they had come
on seeing the city the minds of the people were agitated due to the loss of their prince tears streamed down their eyes oppressed with sorrow
this city without rama just as a river with serpents lifted away by garuda from its depths looks no longer beautiful
plunged in grief they saw the city deprived of all joy looking like a sky without the moon and an ocean without water
those people devoid of delight entered their rich mansions with great difficulty even though they stricken with sorrow looked at men and their own kinsmen they could not recognise them      thus ends the fortyseventh sarga of ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
the people afflicted with sorrow followed rama and returned to the city deeply distressed eyes overflowing with tears they longed for death smitten with grief they lost their highmindedness and looked as if their life had been drained out
the subjects reached their respective homes and surrounded by their sons and wives broke down their faces flooded with tears
the people had no joy in life nor did they find cheer in anything the merchants did not offer their wares for sale the marketplace looked graceless lifeless the stocks were empty the householders did not cook their food
neither loss nor acquisition of wealth mattered to the people no mother rejoiced over getting her firstborn son
in every house women wept and in anguish heaped abuses on their husbands on their arrival at home with words sharp like goads on elephants
for those who do not see rama of what use are the houses or spouses or sons or fortunes or delight
lakshmana is the only fortunate person in the world who has followed rama of the kakutstha race along with sita to serve them
the rivers and the lotuspools have done some meritorious acts in the past as a result of which rama having plunged into their holy waters will make his ablution
forests with beautiful groves rivers with vast expanse of waters mountains with their slopes will enhance the lustre of the scion of the kakutsthas rama
whichever hill or forest rama visits people will receive him there like a welcome guest and will not fail to render hospitality to him
trees with bunches of cololurful flowers and clusters of blossoms hovering over with black bees will present themselves to the son of the raghus rama
the hills will exhibit their excellent flowers and fruits off season out of compassion in order to welcome rama
the mountains displaying various wonderful streams here and there will flow with pellucid waters for rama
the trees on the mountain summits will enchant rama where rama goes there will be no room for fear or dishonour
before that valiant strongarmed son of dasaratha goes too far away from us we should follow him
the shadow of the feet of this magnanimous lord will give us happiness he alone is the goal and protector of all these people he is the supreme refuge
we will serve sita you will serve rama such were the words of the distressed women of the city to their husbands they continued
in the forest rama will look after your wellbeing and sita will ensure our women folks security
the people here are choked with grief who will like to stay here where life is disagreeable cheerless full of despondency and distress
if kaikeyi rules this kingdom unethically we do not want to live here like orphans what is the use of our progeny or property in such a place
can kaikeyi who has brought disgrace to the race by abandoning her husband and son for the sake of wealth spare others
we swear on our sons that as long as kaikeyi lives or we live we will never stay in her kingdom as servants
who can live with pleasure under the rule of kaikeyi of unrighteous character and wicked behaviour one who without compassion banished rama son of dasaratha king of kings
the entire kingdom for the sake of kaikeyi is under a great calamity with no support or leader it will definitely go to ruin
now that rama has been banished the king will not live long after his death there will be evidently only lamentations
where you are in deep trouble with merits exhausted it is better to take poison or follow rama or walk into the unknown
rama along with sita and lakshmana has been deceitfully exiled and all of us delivered to bharata like beasts to a butcher for protection
rama elder brother to lakshmana is a tiger among men a subduer of enemies powerful like an intoxicated elephant and a great charioteer blue in complexion he has a face like the full moon he has lotuslike eyes kneelong arms and fleshy clavicles endowed with a sweet nature he always speaks the truth and the first to speak to others when he roams the forest charming like the moon and pleasing to the whole world he will surely make it look graceful
such was the lamentation of the women of the city overcome with grief as if frightened at the approach of death they wept bitterly
as the women of the city were thus lamenting over the scion of the raghus rama sitting at home the sun set night fell
with sacrificial fires extinguished and the reading of holy scriptures and sacred recitations stopped ayodhya looked as if besmeared with darkness
with markets closed the city of ayodhya cheerless and shelterless looked like the sky without stars
the women grieved over rama as if a son or a brother had been exiled depressed and distressed they wept and sobbed for them rama was indeed more than their sons
with the cessation of singing celebrations dance and music there was no rejoicing in the city the markets displaying merchandise were shut down the city of ayodhya looked like the ocean with its waters diminished     thus ends the fortyeighth sarga of ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
recollecting his fathers command rama the foremost among men covered a long distance during the remaining part of the night
while rama was thus travelling the auspicious night ended with the sandhya morning twilight worship over he reached the frontiers of the country
watching the villages furrowed at the outskirts forests in blossom hearing the gossips of the people living in the midst of villages rama felt he was moving very slowly whereas he had actually covered a long distance with those excellent swift horses
the villagers were speaking among themselves fie on the king who is overtaken by passion alas the heartless sinful kaikeyi indulging in evil has banished into the forest this prince who is righteous and sagacious compassionate and selfrestrained how could this cruel kaikeyi by breaking all limits of decorum resort to such atrocious action
how will sita highly fortunate daughter of janaka and used to comforts endure these sufferings
alas the loveless king dasaratha now intends to abandon his own sinless son rama who is dear to the subjects
such were the words of people living in villages and hamlets that rama the valiant lord of kosala happened to hear as he was crossing the boundaries of kosala
he then crossed the river vedasruti flowing with sacred waters and went in the southern direction where sage agastya resided
travelling for a long time along the river gomati full of cool waters on whose marshy bank cows grazed rama crossed it at the point where it flows into the sea
gomati gone rama with the swiftmoving horses crossed the river syandika echoing with the cries of peacocks and swans
rama showed sita vast tracts of land encircled by kingdoms which were formerly bestowed upon ikshvaku by emperor manu
when shall i return and reunite with my father and mother and go hunting in the blooming forest on the bank of the river sarayu
in this world hunting is a unique pleasure it is regarded as a delightful sport for royal sages but i do not have a great longing for hunting in the forest on the bank of river sarayu
in this world hunting in the woods is a pleasure for royal sages and is greatly sought after by bowmen this was later resorted to by others
the descendant of ikshvaku related to the charioteer in a sweet voice the thoughts that came to him and went on the way continued his journey      thus ends the fortyninth sarga of ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
having crossed the vast beautiful kingdom of kosala the sagacious elder brother of lakshmana stood facing ayodhya with folded palms and said
o ayodhya the best of cities ruled by those born in the kakutstha race i take leave of you and of all those gods inhabiting and guarding you
on completion of exile and my filial obligations to king dasaratha lord of the world discharged i shall reunited with my parents see you again
he looked miserable his copperred eyes filled with tears he raised his right hand and said to the villagers who had come to see him
you have aptly shown your kindness and compassion to me it is not proper to prolong ones grief so do go and altend to your duties
all of them paid their homage by circumambulating the highsouled rama crying bitterly they stood here and there
not yet satisfied they wanted to linger longer they stood weeping while rama went out of sight just as the sun disappears at nightfall
rama the best of men crossed the auspicious land of kosala which was worth seeing by kings it looked charming with sacrificial posts and altars pleasure gardens and mango groves and tanks filled with water it was rich with herds of cattle wealth and foodgrains it was inhabited by charitable contented and wellnourished people free from fear from any quarter and it reverberated with the sounds of vedic recitations
rama the greatest among those endowed with fortitude travelled through the middle of the kingdom which was pleasing prosperous and full of ravishing gardens fit to be enjoyed by kings
there rama saw the holy ganga flowing in three worlds with her sacred waters free from moss and worshipped by sages
the holy ganga adorned with graceful hermitages situated not far away is visited at times by delightful nymphs who sport in her lakes
the ganga is graced by devatas danavas gandharvas and kinneras wives of several gandharvas always visit this auspicious river
since this river flows through heavens for the gods it is wellknown as devapadmini where celestial lotuses grow the river embraces hundreds of hills serving as sporting places and pleasuregardens for gods
the sound of dashing waters of the ganga is like her laughter and the foam like her sparkling smile here she flows straight like the braid of a maiden and there in whirlpools
here the ganga runs deep but quiet there she looks perturbed due to fastflowing waters here she flows with a deep groan and there with a dreadful roar
here hosts of celestials take their ablutions and there she shines with lilies of pure blue here her banks are curved and there her bed is dotted with patches of white sand
the river reverberates with the cries of swans cranes and chakravakas ruddy goose it rings intermittently with the chirpings of birds charged with endless pasison
here on her banks stand trees adorned as though with garlands and there in her waters abound fullblown lilies and a forest of lotuses
here she is decked with hosts of waterlilies and halfblown flowers while elsewhere she looks intoxicated with the pollen fallen from various flowers
the river cleansed of heaps of impurities appears like a transparent gem the interiors of forests on her banks always resounds with the trumpeting of mighty intoxicated wild elephants guarding the quarters fit to be the vehicles of gods
just like a lady ganga is decorated with the best of ornaments her banks are filled with fruits flowers tender leaves or shoots and flowering shrubs it is inhabited by birds and brahmins and infested with sisumaras small whales crocodiles and serpents
mightyarmed rama reached srngaberapura on the bank of this consort of the ocean this ganga loud with the cries of kraunchas and herons this sinless divine ganga destroyer of sins who flows from the feet of lord visnu and by the effulgence penance of sagaras son bhagiratha emerged from the matted locks of lord siva
beholding river ganga full of waves and whirlpools the great chariotwarrior rama said to sumantra we shall spend the night here
o charioteer there is a very large ingudi almond tree not far from the river luxuriant with flowers and budding leaves we shall stay there tonight
we shall watch ganga the best among rivers whose holy waters are respected by gods demons gandharvas beasts serpents men and birds alike
lakshmana and sumantra agreed with rama saying be it so and turned the horses towards that ingudi tree
rama delight of the ikshvakus along with his consort and lakshmana reached that beautiful tree and alighted from the chariot
sumantra also got off the chariot unyoked the horses and with folded palms stood near rama who had already reached the foot of the tree
there lived the mighty king guha who was born in the race of nishadas hunters and became famous as their lord he was a friend to rama who was like his own self
having come to know that rama the best among men had arrived in his region guha accompanied by senior ministers and people of his clan came to greet him
when rama and lakshmana saw from a distance that guha king of the nishadas was approaching them they went forward to receive him
overwhelmed with grief to see rama in bark guha embraced rama and said this is just like ayodhya to you what can i do for you o mightyarmed rama who can have the good fortune of receiving such a beloved guest like you
thereafter he quickly brought rice and various kinds of tasty food and drink as welcome offerings and said to him
o mightyarmed prince welcome to you this entire land belongs to you you are our master and we your servants rule this kingdom happily
all kinds of food to be taken by biting chewing drinking and licking are here for you there is an excellent bed ready there are also enough fodder for the horses
hearing the words of guha rama replied by coming on foot to meet us and by displaying your friendliness you have amply honoured us and pleased us
rama embracing him tightly with his strong arms said o guha it is fortunate that i am able to see you and your relations in good health hope all is well with your friends kingdom and collection of revenue
i must give you back whatever you have offered me so affectionately i am not in a position to accept anything
you must know me as an ascetic devoted to righeousnessand as a wanderer in the forest wearing garments made of bark kusa grass and antelope skin subsisting on fruits and roots
what i now need is fodder for the horses nothing more if you can do this much ill deem it a great honour
if these horses which are the favourites of my father king dasaratha are wellfed i shall consider myself honoured
guha ordered the men standing there give these horses liquids like water and forage
rama wearing the upper garment then offered oblations to sandhya and partook of only water as refreshment brought by lakshmana
lakshmana washed the feet of rama who along with his consort lay upon the ground and returned to take rest under the tree
guha bow in hand conversing with sumantra and soumitri son of sumitra lakshmana then kept vigil over rama by remaining awake all night
as the wise illustrious magnanimous son of dasaratha rama who was used to pleasures and not discomfort lay on the ground the long night slipped away      thus ends the fiftieth sarga of ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
deeply moved to see lakshmana scion of the raghus keeping awake all night without any pretence for his brothers sake guha spoke
o dear prince this comfortable bed has been arranged for you rest happily on this bed
we are used to all kinds of suffering and you to comfort we will keep vigil during the night for the protection of rama descendant of the kakutsthas
for me there is none dearer than rama in this world i speak the truth i swear by truth
i am seeking supreme fame in this world through the attainment of dharma and acquisition of abundant artha by the grace of rama alone
i along with my kinsmen bow in hand will protect my dear friend rama with sita from every side
wandering about in this forest all the time there is nothing unknown to me here we can withstand even a vast army of four divisions
lakshmana said to guha o sinless one when all of us are under your righteous protection we have nothing to fear
when rama son of dasaratha sleeps on the ground with sita how can i sleep or live or enjoy pleasures
look at that rama whom all the gods and demons cannot face in war sleeps so comfortably on the grass with sita
this favourite son of dasaratha who has similar traits like his father was born after he rigorously practised austerities accompanied by vedic mantras when he is banished the king will not live long surely this land will soon be widowed
all the women having cried so much must have quietened down out of sheer exhaustion that is why perhaps the sounds from the royal palace have ceased
i doubt whether all of them the king kausalya and my mother can survive this night
my mother may live looking forward to satrughna but alas kausalya may die separated from her valiant son
that city of ayodhya is full of loyal people it brings them happiness it is dear to them it will perish due to the sad demise of the king
how can the noble king survive unable to see his highsouled beloved eldest son
subsequent to the death of the king kausalya will die and my mother will follow her
past is past irreversible my father brooding over his desire of installing rama as king unfulfilled will perish
those who will remain present around the king my father at the time of his death and perform the funeral rites have their desires fulfilled for they could attend the kings obsequies
they will roam about happily in the capital city of my father with its lovely squares wellaligned broad highways its mansions and palaces full of chariots elephants horses it will be echoing with the sound of trumpets it will be full of the welfare of all it will be graced by the fairest of courtesans filled with wellnourished and contented people the city dotted with several pleasuregardens and parks will look splendid with community festivals and fairs
will the king be still alive will we see the noble king again on our return from exile after the fulfilment of his vows
will we ever be able after completion of the exile to enter the city of ayodhya along with rama who is true to his promise
while that noble prince lakshmana tormented with grief stood thus wailing the night passed off
out of great friendship with guha lakshmana thus told the true story of prince rama in the interest of his subject guha on hearing it guha was deeply afflicted with grief and pain and began shedding tears like an elephant suffering from fever      thus ends the fiftyfirst sarga of ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
as the night advanced towards dawn broadchested rama of great renown said to lakshmana son of sumitra who had auspicious marks on his body
o dear lakshmana the holy night is over and it is time for sunrise the deep dark bird the cuckoo is singing
listen to the screams of the peacocks in the forest the ganga is flowing fast to merge in the sea we need to cross it
in response to ramas desire lakshmana son of sumitra one who brings joy to his friends called guha and the charioteer sumantra and stood before his brother
having heard and accepted ramas proposal the king of the nisadas called his ministers at once and said
get quickly to the sacred bank of ganga a strong auspicious boat equipped with rowing rods and helmsmen who can help cross the river with ease
the ministers heard the orders soon brought a beautiful boat and informed guha that his orders have been carried out
then guha with folded palms said to rama o king the boat ready tell me what else can i do for you
o best among men renowned like a gods son and constantly engaged in vows here is the boat for you to cross the ganga flowing into the sea do board it
thereafter the radiant rama said to guha you have fulfilled my desire keep all our belongings in the boat
rama and lakshmana then put on their quivers fastened their swords and holding their bows went towards ganga along with sita
the charioteer sumantra approached the righteous rama and asked him with folded hands what can i do
rama then caressed sumantra with his right hand and said sumantra go back immediately and never be inattentive in serving the king
you have done enough i shall now leave the chariot and walk into the great forest
having been permitted to go sumantra the distressed charioteer said to rama the best among men and a descendant of the ikshvaku race
none else in this world would be able to live in the forest as you have resolved to like a common man along with your brother and spouse
if your celibacy and your grief are the consequences of your study of the vedic lore your compassionate nature and simplicity of character i think there is no use of all these virtues
valiant scion of the raghus dwelling in the forest along with vaidehi sita and brother lakshmana you will attain the status as if you have won the three worlds
deprived of you o rama we will come under the control of that sinful kaikeyi we will suffer and die
rama was like his sumantras own self when sumantra the charioteer saw that rama was preparing to go afar for a long time he started weeping aloud in deep distress
after the flow of tears ceased sumantra took a sip of water and became sanctified then rama addressed him with sweet words over and over again
i find none else like you as friendly as you are to the ikshvaku race so do whatever you like to see that king dasaratha does not brood over me
i tell you this because the lord of the earth dasaratha is in deep distress he is old and he is under the control of his passion
to make kaikeyi happy do whatever little the great king dasaratha orders you to do
the minds of kings create no hurdles in all that they want to do that is why they rule kingdoms
sumantra do things exactly in the manner the great king desires so that he does not feel sad or disappointed
after offering your salutations tell these words on my behalf to the king who is respectable bent with age and who has conquered his senses and never experienced any sorrow before
i do not regret my banishment from ayodhya to live in the forest neither lakshmana nor sita does
very quickly these fourteen years will come to an end and we will return to ayodhya then you will see me lakshmana and sita off and on
having said this to the king o sumantra tell my mother the other queens including kaikeyi again and again about my wellbeing and the wellbeing of lakshmana and sita convey our respectful salutations at the feet of mother kausalya
tell the king to send for bharata quickly and on his arrival he be placed in the position of the king as per his own desire
on embracing bharata and making him the crownprince the sorrow due to our departure will not affect you
you should tell bharata that just as he treats the king so should he treat all the mothers without differentiating betwen them
princeregency is awaiting you because of our fathers loving desire see that through you your actions he is able to attain happiness in both the worlds
when sumantra was asked by rama to go back he grew griefstricken having heard all that was said by the scion of the kakutsthas he replied
i beg your pardon for what i have told you out of love accept it as the words of a devotee expressed without fear or formality
without you how can i go back to the city of ayodhya which separated from you is grieving like a lady who has lost her son
the people who had seen rama board the chariot will be brokenhearted to see it without him
seeing the empty chariot the people of the city will look pitiable just like an army left only with the charioteer after its hero is killed in the war
although living at a distance the subjects feel in their minds that you are just ahead of them today they will certainly go without food brooding over you
at the time of your departure o rama you have seen all that happened the hearts of the people exhausted with grief
you have witnessed the cry of agony raised by the citizens at the time of your banishment now when they see the empty chariot they will make it raise their cry a hundredfold
what shall i say to kausalya shall i say o venerable queen i have left your son at his maternal uncles hence dont grieve
how can i lie to her how can i tell her the unpleasent truth
how can these excellent horses who used to carry you and your friends till now draw this chariot without you even though they are at my command
that is why o sinless one i cannot go back to ayodhya without you allow me to accompany you into your exile
if you forsake me in spite of my request i shall immediately enter fire along with my chariot
with my chariot i shall retaliate and prevent all those animals in the forest causing obstacles to your austerities o rama
by your grace i experienced the pleasure of driving your chariot and by your grace too i am looking forward to deriving the pleasure of dwelling in the forest
be pleased i wish to stay with you in the forest i long to hear from you these favourable words stay with me
o valiant one if these horses too could render services to you while you dwell in the forest they would attain the supreme state
as i dwell in the forest i shall serve you with my head bowed for this i may altogether relinquish ayodhya or even heaven
just as a sinner cannot enter the capital of indra heaven it is impossible for me to enter ayodhya without you
it is my cherished desire to take you after the completion of your exile back to the city ayodhya in this chariot alone
if i accompany you into the forest fourteen years will pass like a moment otherwise it will seem like a hundred years
o rama you are affectionate towards your servants i abide in the path followed by you my masters son i am your devoted servant it does not behove you to forsake me who is faithful
repeatedly implored in various ways by the miserable sumantra rama who is compassionate to his servants replied
o sumantra listen i know your deep devotion to me i also know you are loyal to your master dasaratha so i am sending you to the city ayodhya from here
when my younger mother kaikeyi sees that you have returned to ayodhya she will believe that rama has really gone to the forest
if queen kaikeyi is fully satisfied that i have gone to dwell in the forest she will no longer have any doubt and will believe that righteous king dasaratha is not a liar
my prime resolve is that my younger mother should enjoy this prosperous and vast kingdom ruled by her son bharata
sumantra return to the city with the chariot for my pleasure and also for the pleasure of the king and convey to each of the persons concerned the message exactly as instructed
having spoken to the charioteer and consoling him again and again indefatigable rama spoke to guha words full of reasoning
guha this forest where people live is not suitable for my stay it is necessary that i live in a hermitage so please do the needful
seeking the welfare of my father sita and lakshmana i shall enter the forest with matted hair and practise the prescribed austerities which are the adornments of ascetics do fetch me the sap of a banyan tree
guha fetched the latex quickly and gave it to the prince rama and with that rama matted his own hair and lakshmanas
the longarmed rama the best of men put on locks of matted hair as the two brothers rama and lakshmana stood dressed in bark wearing crowns of matted hair they resembled two resplendent ascetics
having adopted the path of ascetics along with lakshmana rama said to his friend guha
o guha you must be vigilant about your army treasury forts and provinces a kingdom it is rightly said is protected with great difficulty
rama delight of the iksvakus then permitted guha to take leave and departed quickly with his consort and lakshmana in peace
seeing the boat on the river bank and intending to cross the swiftly flowing ganga rama descendant of the iksvakus said to lakshmana
o lakshmana the best of men the boat stands ready get into it slowly carefully and then help the noble sita board it by holding the beam which balances the boat
having heard his brothers command the selfcontrolled lakshmana did as he was toldhe first helped sita get into the boat and thereafter boarded it himself
with the boat boarded by the glorious rama lakshmanas elder brother guha king of the nishadas urged his kinsmen to row the boat
resplendent rama boarded the boat and muttered for his own safety mantras befitting brahmins and kshatriyas
rama of undimmed radiance sipped the waters of the ganga in accordance with the scriptures and with great pleasure and paid obeisance to the river with sita and lakshmana
having permitted sumantra and guha with his army to leave rama seated on the boat urged the boatmen to proceed
the wellruddered boat rowed by the helmsmen and propelled by strong oars swiftly crossed the waters of the river
when the boat reached the midstream that unblemished sita with palms folded invoked the river thus
o ganga protected by you this son rama of dasaratha the sagacious maharaja will carry out his fathers command he along with his brother will return after living in the forest for full fourteen years o fortunate devi he will worship you in delight for fulfilling all his desires after his safe return
o devi you are tripathaga flowing in three directions worlds you behold the region of brahma and happen to be the spouse of the king of the ocean in this world of mortals
o devi o lovely ganga i offer you my obeisance and my adorations after the safe return of rama the tiger best among men from the forest and after he regains the kingdom i shall give a hundred thousand cows clothing and delicious food to brahmins as a mark of regard which will please you
o devi after my return to ayodhya purified by my austerities i shall worship you by offering a thousand pots of nectar and food in the form of meat
i shall worship all those deities inhabiting your banks and all sacred spots and temples
o sacred one may the blemishless mightyarmed rama accompanied by me and his brother reenter ayodhya after the exile
while the unblemished auspicious sita was thus addressing the river the boat swiftly reached the south bank
rama the best of men and tormentor of enemies after reaching the other side of the river left the boat and proceeded with sita and his brother
the longarmed rama then said to lakshmana enhancer of the joy of sumitra whether in populated areas or in solitary places excercise alacrity in the matter of protection
in this desolate forest which we had never seen before we must certainly be concerned about our protection o lakshmana let sita follow you
o best of men i will follow you and sita and keep watch we must ensure mutual protection
we have not yet confronted any hardship from now on sita will come to know the difficulties of forest life
now she will enter the forest which is devoid of concourse of people farms and pleasure groves and which is uneven and inaccessible and full of deep ditches
having heard the words of rama lakshmana went ahead and rama delight of the raghus walked behind sita
the wretched sumantra kept gazing at rama who swiftly reached the other side of the ganga and only when he could not see him because of long distance he turned away his gaze and overcome with grief shed tears
having crossed that mighty river the highsouled rama bestower of boons and equal in splendour to the protector of the world reached vatsa by and by a highly prosperous country inhabited by happy people
famished they rama and lakshmana killed a boar a rishya whitefooted male antelope a spotted deer and a great deer with black stripes they partook the meat and reached a tree by evening where they rested for the night      thus ends the fiftysecond sarga of ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
on reaching the foot of the tree rama offered oblations to sandhya of the west and then he who is the best in keeping people in good humour said to lakshmana
we will have to spend this first night without sumantra and away from human habitation yet you need not worry
o lakshmana from now on we must be sleeplessly vigilant at night the welfare and safety of sita depend on us both
o lakshmana we will have to somehow pass this night sleeping on the ground spread with whatever we have procured
rama who deserved a luxurious bed lay down on the ground and uttered these beneficial words to lakshamana
o lakshmana the maharaja must be having a painful sleep tonight but kaikeyi with her desires fulfilled ought to feel satisfied
after the arrival of bharata i hope queen kaikeyi does not deprive the king of his life for the sake of the kingdom
that lustful king having come under the hold of kaikeyi has been deprived of my presence what can that forlorn and aged king do
reflecting on the calamity and mental aberration of the king i think passion is stronger than wealth and righteousness
o lakshmana will even an illiterate man for the sake of a woman ever abandon his son like me who is faithful and obedient as did my father
bharata son of kaikeyi with his wife will alone enjoy like an emperor this kingdom of kosala full of happy people
the king is advanced in age and i have to dwell in the forest therefore bharata alone will be the chief of this entire kingdom
any king who abandons dharma and artha and adopts a life of pleasure will very soon reach this state as dasaratha has attained
o handsome lakshmana i think kaikeyi has come to our house for the destruction of dasaratha for my banishment and enthronement of bharata in the kingdom
intoxicated with her good fortune will not kaikeyi torment kausalya and sumitra for my sake
o lakshmana because of me mother sumitra should not live in sorrow therefore tomorrow morning go back to ayodhya from here itself
i shall go with sita into the dandaka forest and you be the protector of the helpless kausalya
kaikeyi who is a woman of heinous deeds may follow out of hostility an unjust way in respect of my mother in that case my mother may be entrusted to the care of bharata who is righteous
o lakshmana surely in one of her previous births did my mother separate women from their sons that is why this calamity has befallen her
kausalya nurtured me for a long time and reared me with great difficulty when she was going to enjoy the fruits of her labour i have been separated from her fie upon me
o lakshmana i am causing endless sorrow to my mother may no mother give birth to a son like me
on hearing my banishment her myna would say to her parrot o parrot bite the foot of the enemy kaikeyi i think that bird is a greater source of joy to my mother than i o lakshmana
my mother has less fortune and more grief like a woman without a son o lakshmana subduer of enemies for her what is the use of a son like me who cannot render any service to her
my mother is unlucky as she has been separated from me extremely distressed she must have plunged into an ocean of grief
once enraged o lakshmana i can overpower ayodhya even the whole world all by myself with my arrows but exhibition of prowess without any reason is not desirable
o sinless one i did not get myself coronated owing to fear of unrighteous conduct and fear of the other world
like this and in many other ways rama lamented pitifully in that desolate forest when his face was filled with tears he sat silently in the night
lakshmana consoled rama who ceased to lament like fire with extinguished flames or like a motionless sea
o rama foremost of warriors it is certain that since your departure the city of ayodhya must be lustreless like night without the moon
this is not the way you should lament o rama o foremost of men by doing so you are disheartening me and sita as well
without you sita or i will not survive even for a moment like a fish taken out of water o rama
without you o rama tormentor of enemies i wish to see neither father nor satrughna nor sumitra nor even heaven itself
thereafter rama and sita the duo nurturers of righteousness from their comfortable seats moved to the bed wellmade under the banyan tree not far from there where they were sitting and lay down to sleep
rama the tormentor of enemies listened out of love to the excellent and copious words of lakshmana and permitted him to live in the forest for the entire period of fourteen years by observing the prescribed code of conduct as enjoined on life in the forest
then the two mighty perpetuators of the raghu race who were like two lions dwelling on the slopes of mountains lived in that lonely forest without fear or hesitation     thus ends the fiftythird sarga of ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
they rama sita and lakshmana spent that auspicious night under that great tree and set out from there after the bright sun rose
illustrious rama sita and lakshmana entered the deep forest and saw the different regions of the land and other enchanting places which they had never seen before and proceeded towards the region where the river yamuna merged with bhagirathi ganga
walking on the safe path and observing various kinds of trees rama said to lakshmana at the end of the day
o son of sumitra look at the column of smoke rising like the banner of the venerable firegod near prayaga i think an ascetic dwells nearby
we have surely reached the confluence of ganga and yamuna which can be ascertained from the sounds of clashing water
here are logs of wood cut into pieces by forestdwellers living on forest products you can see various trees near the hermitage of sage bharadwaja
the two archers rama and lakshmana reached comfortably walking at an easy pace by evening the hermitage of sage bharadwaja near the confluence of ganga and yamuna
seeing rama approaching the hermitage the deer and the birds were frightened proceeding on the path for a while rama reached the place of bharadwaja
thereafter the two heroes followed by sita arrived at the hermitage and wishing to see the sage waited at a distance
rama entered the hermitage and saw that highsouled bharadwaja surrounded by his disciples he was a distinguished sage who himself kindled sacrficial fires and acquired spiritual insight by practising rigid austerities with concentration of mind and ascetic powers rama lakshmana and sita paid their obeisance to that great sage
lakshmanas elder brother rama introduced himself to bharadwaja o venerable one we are both sons of dasaratha rama and lakshmana
this blessed one is my consort sita daughter of janaka irreproachable she has followed me to the desolate grove of penance hermitage
this is the son of sumitra my beloved younger brother a man of firm resolve he has accompanied me when i was sent on exile to the forest by my father
o venerable one on my fathers command we entered the desolate forest of penance subsisting on roots and fruits i shall practise the righteous way of life
sage bharadwaja heard the words of sagacious rama and offered a bull water for washing feet and arghya offering to a guest
the ascetic who practised severe penance offered them different kinds of food and drink made from roots and fruits available in the forest he also provided them a place to rest in
there the sage sat surrounded by hermits animals and birds after having welcomed rama with due honour
rama accepted the hospitality of bharadwaja and took a seat in front of the sage who spoke to him these words in conformity with righteousness
o descendant of the kakutstha dynasty i am able to see you on your arrival here after a long time i have also heard about your unwarranted banishment
this sacred and solitary region near the confluence of two great rivers ganga and yamuna is a pleasant place you may stay here comfortably
rama ever devoted to the wellbeing of every one heard bharadwaja and replied to him with these auspicious words
o venerable sage i feel the people living in nearby villages and towns perceiving that we can be easily seen here will frequent this ashram this is the reason i dont wish to stay here
o revered one janakas daughter sita deserves comfort suggest a solitary and agreeable place for our hermitage where she can enjoy herself
on hearing the auspicious words of rama conveying his intention the great sage bharadwaja replied to him thus
o my son ten krosas about twenty miles from here is a mountain wellknown as chitrakuta resembling gandhamadana that mountain frequented by maharshis is sacred it looks pleasant from all sides monkeys apes and bears wander there and it is an appropriate place for you to live in
as long as one beholds the peaks of mount chitrakuta he will be inspired to do good deeds and will not employ his mind in sinful thoughts
on the chitrakuta mountain many ascetics wandered about lived for hundreds of years carrying on penance in the process they became so much emaciated that they looked as if they were left only with the skulls on their heads in the end they ascended heaven
o rama i think you will enjoy your stay there in a solitary place or else you may live with me here during the period of banishment
bharadwaja who knows his duty honoured rama his beloved guest with his consort and brother by extending all kinds of hospitality
at prayaga while the great sage bharadwaja was narrating to rama sitting near him several interesting anecdotes the holy night set in
the exhausted scion of the kakutsthas used to comforts stayed in the lovely hermitage of bharadwaja for the night with sita as the third member of the group
when the night passed into dawn rama the best of men approached the resplendent bharadwaja and said
o venerable sage devoted to truth we have spent the night in your hermitage please permit us to depart for the dwellingplace suggested by you
when the night came to a close bharadwaja said to rama you may proceed to chitrakuta which abounds in roots fruits and honey
o mighty rama i think mount chitrakuta is the right place for you to stay go there that mountain is full of trees of every kind is inhabited by kinneras and uragas serpents it echoes with the cries of peacocks is frequented by mighty tuskers filled with fruits and roots it is sacred and pleasant
you will see o rama herds of elephants and deer ranging in the forest
your heart will be filled with joy while you wander with sita beholding rivers waterfalls plateaus caverns and mountaintorrents
the auspicious mountain chaitrakuta resounds with the note of cheerful lapwings and cuckoos intoxicated elephants and deer move about in the enchanting mountain there you may settle down in a hermitage       thus ends the fiftyfourth sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
after spending the night the princes destroyers of enemies offered obeisance to that great sage bharadhwaja and went towards that mount chitrkuta
seeing them setting forth the great sage blessed them for a safe journey and followed them like a father following his children
then that great effulgent sage bharadwaja began to speak to rama whose strength was truth
reaching the confluence of rivers ganga and yamuna o rama and lakshmana best among men proceed along the kalindi yamuna river flowing westward
on reaching that swiftflowing river yamuna o rama and lakshmana o scions of the raghu race you will find an ancient spot on the river bank there make a raft and cross kalindi daughter of the sun
there you will find a large banyan tree with its lush green leaves looking dark with its densely grown trees it is inhabited by siddhas sita should offer with folded palms invocations for her wellbeing
reaching that tree you may tarry or proceed further a krosa from there you will see a beautiful forest filled with dark trees mixed with palasas and badaris and bamboos on the yamuna
that path leads to chitrakuta i had travelled through it several times it is beautiful smooth and safe from forest fires
the great sage returned after instructing rama about the path so be it said rama and offering obeisance requested bharadhwaja to go back
with the sage gone rama said o saumitri son of sumitra we are lucky for the sage has been so kind
thus talking with one another the two nobleminded tigers best among men advanced towards river kalindi yamuna with sita walking in front
thereafter they all reached the rapidly flowing river kalindi and began pondering how to cross it
then they both made a big wooden float by joining logs of wood spreading bamboos on it and covering it with the fragrant roots of ushira bushes
the valiant lakshmana cut the stems of reeds and branches of the jambu tree to prepare a comfortable seat for sita on that float
rama son of dasaratha helped his beloved sita who was looking inconceivably like lakshmi goddess of wealth and was feeling a little bashful while stepping on to the float
rama placed robes and ornaments on the float by the side of sita and a spade and a basket along with weapons
those valiant sons of dasaratha held the float firmly to help sita step on to it then they crossed the river carefully
on reaching the middle of the river yamuna sita made reverential salutations to her saying o goddess i am crossing you may safety be ours and may my husband fulfil his vow after ramas safe return to the city of ayodhya ruled by the ikshvaku kings i shall worship you with a thousand cows and a hundred pots of wine
while sita with her fair complexion was thus invoking river yamuna with folded hands they reached the southern bank
they crossed the swiftflowing river yamuna daughter of the sungod full of waves and with trees growing thick on her banks
having crossed the river they left the float and proceeded from the adjoining forest of yamuna and reached the dark cool banyan tree covered with lush green leaves
having reached the banyan tree sita invoked it saying o great tree i offer you my salutations may my husband fulfil his vow may i behold kausalya and the illustrious sumitra on my return saying so she went round the tree offering reverential salutations with folded hands
beholding the obedient blemishless beloved sita invoking blessings rama said to lakhsmana
o lakshmana best among bipeds men and brother of bharata walk ahead with sita and i shall follow with weapons
whatever fruit or flower the daughter of janaka asks for get it whatever pleases her mind give it
the daughter of janaka walked between them like a sheelephant between two males
that gentle lady enquired of rama about a tree or a shrub or a creeper in full bloom which she did not see before
cheered by sitas indents lakshmana brought her various beautiful plants and stocks of flowers
beholding the river yamuna with its wonderful water and sand echoing with the cackle of swans and cranes sita went ecstatic
after walking a krosa into the forest on the bank of yamuna the two brothers killed many deer suitable for sacrifice and ate them
they reached the tableland on the bank of that river and moved in high spirit in the lovely forest resounding with cries of flocks of peacocks and teeming with monkeys and elephants finally they selected a spot for their stay     thus ends the fiftyfifth sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
when the night was over rama delight of the raghus gently awakened lakshmana who was asleep
listen to the songs of the forest birds o son of sumitra o tormentor of foes it is time we set out
awakened by his brother in time lakshmana shook off his sleep his drowsiness and his fatigue due to journey
then they all rose touched the rivers auspicious waters and went the way the sage had directed towards mount chitrakuta
early in the morning rama set out with lakshmana and said this to sita with eyes like lotus petals
o daughter of videha behold these kimsuka trees in full bloom everywhere with the passing of winter they appear bright as though they are garlanded by their own flowers
behold these bhallataka trees in full bloom though there are none to enjoy them they are bent with fruits and leaves surely we can live here this place is fit for our habitation
o lakshmana see the honeycombs of the size of wooden vessels crowded by the honeybees hanging down from every tree
in this delightful forest region strewn with fallen flowers the peacock is responding to the screaming of natyuha bird
see these flocks of singing birds followed by herds of elephants see this mount chitrakuta with its towering peaks
o dear this sacred forest of chitrakuta standing on a level land is full of various trees let us enjoy it
then they both along with sita walked to that lovely delightful chitrakuta mountain
rama arrived at that enchanting mountain full of various kinds of birds fruits and roots and sweet water and said to lakshmana
o gentle one this enchanting mountain with different kinds of trees and creepers and many roots and fruits appears to be a happy place to live in
great sages reside on this high mountain let it be our habitation and let us enjoy our life here o handsome one
thus rama sita and lakshmana approached the hermitage of sage valmiki and paid obeisance to him with folded hands
the great sage valmiki conversant with righteousness was delighted he honoured them by extending welcome and said be seated
the mightyarmed elder brother of lakshmana revealed his identity to the sage by duly introducing himself and said then to lakshmana
o handsome lakshmana make a hut with strong sound logs of wood my mind impels me to stay here
having heard rama saumitri the subduer of enemies fetched different kinds of logs of wood and with them made a hut and thatched it with leaves
rama saw the goodlooking leafhut with mats tied around as walls and said to lakshmana who was awaiting further command with rapt attention
o lakshmana those who intend to live for long in this hut should pacify the deity presiding over here therefore we shall bring the venison of a black antelope and make necessary offerings
slay an antelope and bring it here quickly o lakshmana the rites as prescribed by the scriptures will have to be carried out you may recollect that tradition
lakshmana slayer of heroes on the enemys side understood and implemented what he was told rama again said to him
cook this venison o handsome one we will offer it to the presiding deity of this hut hasten the day and time are fixed for the rites
then the powerful son of sumitra killed a black antelope fit for offering and offered it to the wellkindled fire
with the blood drained out of the venison lakshmana roasted it and cooked it well and then said to rama the tiger best among men
this black antelope with all its limbs is wellcooked o divine sire you may make the offering to vastu devata in which you are proficient
virtuous rama who was an expert in the recitation of mantras took his bath and his mind controlled intoned briefly all the mantras appropriate to the completion of the ritual
sanctified with the worship of all the gods rama of immeasurable lustre felt a great happiness on entering the hut
rama offered oblations to visvadevas rudra and visnu performed the auspices for the appeasement of the household deity and having muttered japa silently in conformity with tradition he took his ablution in the river as enjoined by the sastras and offered his final oblations for the expiation of his sins
rama son of the raghus made altars in all the quarters places of worship and sacred spots for fire befitting a hermitage
bestowed with auspicious qualities rama and lakshmana along with sita propitiated those celestial beings with garlands of forest flowers fruits and roots wellcooked venison water muttering of prayers as expounded in the vedas faggots and kusa grass and entered that auspicious hermitage
until rama reached the southern bank guha kept talking with sumantra for long and returned home with great sorrow
positioned there they could mark their arrival at bharadwajas at prayaga their stay nighthalt and their onward journey to chitrakuta mountain
permitted by rama to leave sumantra harnessed the best of horses and set out for the city of ayodhya with a heavy heart
beholding the fragrancefilled forests rivers lakes villages and towns on the way sumantra quickly crossed them
the charioteer reached ayodhya on the third day at dusk and found the city cheerless
beholding the silent city almost empty the deeply depressed sumantra afflicted with gushing tears reflected
has the city along with its elephants horses people and its king perished in the fire of grief for rama
absorbed in these thoughts the charioteer came to the citygate carried by the swiftfooted horses and quickly entered the city
meanwhile as the charioteer was moving towards the city hundreds and thousands of men came pouring towards him enquiring where is rama
i took leave of the great righteous rama on the bank of the ganga and have returned with his permission replied sumantra
hearing that they had the trio crossed the river ganga the people with their faces filled with tears sighed and saying fie upon us alas rama cried out aloud
he saw them gathering in groups saying henceforth we will not be able to see rama and without him we are lost indeed
no longer will we see rama at sacrifices weddings great assemblies and at places of charitable activity
rama looked after his people like a father always thinking what was good for them dear to them and comfortable to them
he heard wailings of women looking through the window and of the people in marketplaces burning with sorrow over ramas exile
sumantra with his face muffled drove along the highway straight to the palace of king dasaratha
quickly alighting from the chariot he entered the kings palace and crossed the seven courtyards overcrowded with people
women from mansions sevenstoried buildings and from royal palaces sighted him and pained at not seeing rama cried out alas alas
the women in great anguish stood silently looking at one another their large eyes flooded with overflowing tears
from different spots in the palace sumantra heard the sobs and whispers of dasarathas wives who were tormented with the sorrow of ramas exile
the charioteer left with rama and returned without him what can he say to the wailing kausalya
i think it is indeed difficult for kausalya to live wherever and whichever way she tries as she has been separated from her son the queens said
listening to the correct words of the kings wives he immediately entered the palace as if in flames of grief
on entering the eighth courtyard he saw in a pale white chamber king dasaratha desolate anguished and withered with the sorrow of separation from his son
sumantra approached the king who was seated paid obeisance to him and conveyed ramas words verbatim
the king silently listened to ramas message bewildered and tormented by the grief of ramas absence he fell down on the ground in a swoon
the moment the lord of the earth fell down on the ground unconscious the women in the inner apartment burst into tears raising their arms
having seen her husband collapsed on the ground kausalya assisted by sumitra lifted him up and said to him thus
o distinguished king why are you not enquiring from the messenger about him rama who is capable of performing arduous tasks
o descendant of the raghus are you ashamed of having done an injustice arise you may be a blessed one for fulfilling your promise if you grieve none will help you
kaikeyi for fear of whom you dare not ask the charioteer about rama o king is not here you may speak to him without fear
absorbed in grief kausalya spoke to the maharaja in a voice choked with tears and then collapsed on the floor
all those women saw weeping kausalya as well as their husband fallen on the ground and wailed loudly in a chorus
having heard the sound emanating from the inner apartment people old young and women of the city lamented the city was crowded again      thus ends the fiftyseventh sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
when the king regained his consciousness and was consoled he summoned the charioteer to hear news about rama
then the charioteer with folded palms approached the king who deeply afflicted with grief and pain was brooding over rama alone aged dasaratha was heaving deep sighs like a newlycaptured indisposed elephant
seeing the dejected charioteer standing before him the desolate king covered all over with dust and his face bathed in tears said to him in extreme grief
o charioteer rama is rightous and he is acustoomed to all sorts of comfort taking refuge at the foot of a tree how shall he live and what shall he eat
how can the son of the guardian of the earth who is accustomed to a comfortable bed and not to undeserved suffering lie down on the ground like an orphan o sumantra
wherever rama went elephants chariots and footsoldiers followed him how can he now live in the desolate forest where he has taken refuge
how can the two young men along with vaidehi live in the forest infested with black cobras and wicked wild animals
o sumantra how did those two princes along with pitiable delicate sita alight from the chariot and enter the forest on foot
you are blessed indeed o charioteer to have seen my sons entering the outskirts of the forest like aswinis stepping into the region of the mandara mountain
upon reaching the forest o sumantra what did rama lakshmana and sita say
tell me o charioteer where rama sat where he slept what food he ate only your words will enable me to live like yayati among saints
thus questioned by the king the charioteer his voice choked with tears and words faltering in grief addressed the king
with palms folded and head bowed o great king rama offered his salutations to you in confirmity with righteousness and said to me
convey on my behalf o charioteer to my illustrious father who is known for his selfknowledge and is worthy of homage that i am saluting his feet with my head bowed
on my behalf convey o charioteer without any distinction my salutations to all the women befitting their status and tell them i was enquiring about their wellbeing
convey my mother carefully my saluations and my wellbeing and tell her
o mother adhering to the righteous path and performing in time the rituals in the chamber of sacrificial fire offer your services at the feet of king dasaratha as if he were a god
o mother conduct yourself with other mothers without pride and egoism ensure that venerable kaikeyi remains welldisposed towards the king
behave towards young bharata as to a king irrespective of age a king is a king hence should be honoured you should keep this rajadharma royal prerogative in mind
tell bharata of my welfare and tell him on my behalf that he should honour all our mothers equally
the king is advanced in age do not restrict him in any manner carry out his orders as prince regent and live happily
shedding profuse tears rama continued look after my mother who is covetous of her son as your own mother
while saying this the red lotuslike eyes of illustrious rama streamed with tears o maharaja
but lakshmana seething with anger and sighing said for what offence has this kings son been banished
the king too submitting to the trash command of kaikeyi has perpetrated an act just or unjust he knows better for which we are made to suffer so much
whether it was out of greed for the kingdom or for the execution of the boon bestowed this act of banishment is by all means wicked
or he might have thought he is the overlord and can do as he likes or he might have done this for fear of god otherwise i do not see any reason for the abandonment of rama
unjustly foolishly and without proper consideration rama has been banished this will definitely cause sorrow
i do not regard the great king as my father rama alone is my brother protector friend and father
how can anyone in this world be pleased with you for deserting rama the beloved of all and ever devoted to their welfare
having banished the righteous rama the delight of all subjects and thereby antagonizing the entire world how can you claim to be their king
o great king as for that sensitive janaki she stood sighing stupefied and oblivious of the past yet smiling as though her mind was possessed by an evil spirit
that glorious princess sita who had never experienced any adversity earlier weeping with sorrow could not even speak to me anything
when she saw me leaving she looked at her husband with a dry pale face and suddenly burst into tears
supported by lakshmanas arms rama stood his face streaming with tears and palms folded while the wretched sita glaring at me and the royal chariot weeping      thus ends the fiftyeighth sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
listening to the charioteer the best of ministers sumantra the king asked him to tell the rest
having heard him sumantra overcome with tears related further details of ramas message
o king the heroes in bark robes and with matted hair crossed the ganga and proceeded towards prayaga
lakshmana walked ahead guarding rama the delight of the raghus while i returned helplessly seeing them go
when rama set out for the forest and i turned back my horses shedding hot tears were reluctant to walk the path
thereafter controlling my grief and paying obeisance to both the princes with folded palms i ascended the chariot and returned
there along with guha i waited for three days that rama might call me back
o great king even trees with their flowers buds and shoots throughout your empire have withered because of the calamity on rama
water in rivers ponds and lakes has heated up while all the foliage in the forests and gardens have shrivelled
no living being move about and even wild animals roam no more overwhelmed with grief on account of rama a great silence pervades the forest
the water in the lotus lakes o king has become turbid the blue lotuses have withered and their shrivelled petals are submerged in water the fishes and aquatic birds are hidden under waters
bunches of flowers grown in water and on land as well as fruits with their scant fragrance do not shine as before
pleasuregardens are all deserted as the birds have vanished o best of men as such they do not look beautiful
none greeted me when i entered ayodhya people heaved sighs repeatedly when they did not see rama
beholding the royal chariot arrive without rama all were on the highway shedding tears of anguish
when the women from mansions sevenstoried buildings and from royal palaces saw the chariot without rama they overwhelmed with sorrow cried alas alas
the women with their large bright eyes flooded with gushing tears looked in silence at one another in deep anguish
i did not see any difference in the degree of anguish among friends those who are not friends and and those who are indifferent the degree of agony was same in all
o maharaja ayodhya is filled with cheerless people with deep sighs agonised voices and pale faces depressed and distressed due to ramas exile even elephants and horses look spiritless for me it the city resembles dejected kausalya deprived of her son
at these words of the charioteer the king in deep distress replied with a voice choked with tears
incited by kaikeyi of sinful relations and sinful motive i did not consult expert elderly counsellers
for the sake of a woman this act was committed in great haste without consulting friends or ministers or men of prudence
surely it is destiny and this calamity has befallen for the wilful destruction of the entire race o charioteer
o charioteer if ever i have rendered you any favour quickly take me to rama my life is hastening me fast running out
if my command prevails today rama may be brought back without rama i cannot live for a moment even
where is that rama elder brother to lakshmana who has wellshaped teeth and wields a mighty bow if i can see him along with sita i will survive
if i cannot see rama of redcoloured eyes the mightyarmed one and wearing earrings bedecked with precious stones i shall surely go to the abode of yama the god of death
what else can be of greater sorrow to me who having reached this state am still unable to see rama
ah rama ah lakshmana ah unfortunate vaidehi you do not know that i am dying like an orphan because of my grief
the king whose mind was extremely enfeebled due to grief and who was immersed in a sea of tears which he was unable to cross continued
o queen kausalya i am completely immersed in this ocean of sorrow the misfortune due to ramas separation is its breadth sitas separation is the other end of the shore sighs are its turbulent waves and whirlpools tears are its foam and turbid waters waving of arms is its fishes cries of agony are its roars my dishevelled hair is its moss kaikeyi is the mouth of badaba my copious tears are its source words of the hunchback manthara are the monstrous crocodiles the cruel boons to kaikeyi are its shores without rama i cannot cross this sea of sorrow alive ah what a pity
though i wish i cannot see rama together with lakshmana indeed this is very unfortunate lamenting thus king dasaratha of great reknown fell on the bed unconscious
wailing dasaratha fell unconscious he was doubly grieved due to his yearning for rama ramas mother was seized with fear hearing those lamentations     thus ends the fiftyninth sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
thereafter kausalya trembling as if possessed by an evil spirit and rolling on the floor like one who her senses now and again said to the charioteer sumantra
take me where rama sita and lakshmana are i do not wish to live even for a moment without them
turn back your chariot immediately and take me to the dandaka forest if i do not follow them i shall enter the world of yama
with folded hands and faltering words choked by his fastflowing tears the charioteer tried to console kausalya
abandon your tears delusion and despair arising out of sorrow rama is going to live in the forest brushing aside all agony
selfcontrolled lakshmana aware of his duty serves rama in the forest by this he is securing his next world
sita with her mind fixed on rama is living confidently in that desolate forest without any fear as if it were her home
i could not see even the slightest depression in sita as if she was accustomed to staying away from home
earlier just as sita used to revel in the gardens of the city so does she now in those desolate forests
charming sita whose face resembles the full moon with her mind fixed on rama is enjoying even the desolate forest like a child
her heart is ever united with rama and her life is under his control without rama even ayodhya would become a forest for her
seeing villages cities trees of different kinds and courses of rivers sita is enquiring from rama or lakshmana about them she feels as though she is sporting in the pleasuregarden just a krosa from ayodhya
sita did say something about kaikeyi but now i do not remember what
diverting the context of what he uttered inadvertently relating to kaikeyi the charioteer said pleasing words of consolation to kausalya
just like the beams of the moon sitas glow is not affected by the fatigue of the journey or by the speed of the wind or by the scorching heat
the countenance of sita with her gentle eloquence resembles a hundredpetalled lotus she has the luminance of the full moon that has not wilted
her feet now devoid of lacdye still look red like lac and shine like the lotus bud
casting off her ornaments the damsel sita is gracefully walking as if dalliant with her tinkling anklets for her love for him rama
though in the forest sita under the protection of ramas arms is afraid of neither elephants nor lions nor tigers
you need not lament for them or for yourself or for the king this story of rama will endure permanently in the world
they are upholding the sacred promise of their father with cheerful hearts grief given the goby steadfastly pursuing the path established by maharsis subsisting on forest fruits and enjoying the forest life
though sumantra was speaking with befitting words to prevent kausalya from weeping over her son which had enfeebled her she did not stop crying o my beloved o my son o rama      thus ends the sixtieth sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
when rama the greatest among those who please the people he who was conscious of his duty left for the forest kausalya sobbing in bitter anguish said to her husband
your great fame has spread all over the three worlds people know you as compassionate generous and sweetspeaking scion of the raghus
o dasaratha the best among kings how will your two sons and sita brought up in great comfort now tolerate the hardships of forest life
how can the daughter of mithila sita who in the prime of her life accustomed to comforts endure heat and cold indeed
how can the largeeyed sita having enjoyed delicious food mixed with condiments and soup now partake the food prepared with wild grains
how can the blameless sita used to the soft sound of songs and musical instruments hear the frightful roars of lions and other carnivorous animals
where will that mightyarmed and powerful rama as lofty as indras banner sleep using his ironbarlike arm as pillow
when shall i see rama with his lotushued face his beautiful locks of hair breath of lotus fragrance and eyes like blue lotus
no doubt my heart must be made of thunderbolt since unable to see rama it does not split into a thousand pieces
o king it is because of your heartless action my rama and my relatives who deserve to enjoy pleasures at this age have been banished and are miserably wandering in wilderness
even if rama returns in the fifteenth year it is unlikely that bharata will give up the kingdom and royal treasury in favour of rama
some first feed their own relatives in shraddha ceremony and thereafter look for the best of brahmins to feed
the godlike brahmins who are virtuous and learned will not accept the food after others have partaken even if it is ambrosia
the bulls best among the wise brahmins would not like to accept the food after it is tasted by other brahmins just as bulls dislike their horns being shorn
o lord of the world why not the eldest and the most distinguished among the brothers likewise disdain the kingdom enjoyed by the younger brother
just as a tiger will not eat the food acquired by another beast rama the tiger best among men will not accept the kingdom enjoyed by others
havis sacrificial offerings like ghee cakes kusha grass and sacrificial posts made from khadira wood once used in the sacrifice cannot be used again
in the same way rama will not accept this kingdom enjoyed by others like liquour or soma juice drained of its essence
rama highly determined will not suffer this indignity if enraged he can split open even mount mandara with his sharp arrows
out of respect for his father magnanimous rama is not inclined to kill you he has not defied the anger the sun the moon and the sky looking wonderful with stars can be pulled down he will not even shake or break the earth surrounded by hundreds of mountains
a powerful tiger will not allow its tail to be twisted in the same way rama also will not tolerate an insult of this sort
even if all the worlds were to unite and fight against him he will not fear this righteous rama will reestablish justice in this unrighteous world
valiant and mightyarmed rama with his golden shafts can annihilate all living beings and oceans like at the time of deluge everything is consumed in fire
such rama the best among men powerful like a lion with eyes fierce like that of a bull has been destroyed by his own father just as the big fish destroys its own offsprings
you have banished your son who is devoted to righteousness is it in accordance with the scriptures and the eternal tradition followed by the twiceborn
o king for a woman the first refuge is the husband the second her son the third her relatives and there is no fourth alternative in this world
forced to hear the harsh words of angry kausalya the king deeply distressed was absorbed in sad thought
the king dasaratha tormentor of enemies for a while lost his consciousness his senses bewildered after a long time he regained his senses
when he regained his senses the king heaved deep hot sighs seeing kausalya by his side he relapsed into a state of anxiety
while he was thus reflecting on a sinful act he had inadvertently comitted long ago the act of discharging an arrow that could hit its target following the sound flashed in his mind
the great king the lord with a broken heart started regretting deeply about both the grievous acts he had committed previously one is shooting at the son of a sage and the other banishing rama
consumed by the double sorrow the king trembling with head down and folding his hands said to kausalya in order to appease her
o kausalya i entreat you with folded palms be merciful forever affectionate you are not cruel even towards your enemies
o devi for women who have regard for righteousness a husband whether virtuous or not is a god incarnate
you always adhere to righteousness you have seen both the extremes good and bad of this world athough you yourself are in grief it does not behove you to speak unpleasant words to one who is suffering from a greater grief
kausalya heard the pitiable words uttered by the king who was in a wretched condition she shed tears like a water channel discharging fresh rainwater
frightened kausalya weeping and raising her palms folded like lotus on to her head and charged with emotions said with stumbling syllables
o lord by falling on the ground at your feet bowing my head i beg of you to be pleased by your act of beseeching me i have been badly hurt i do deserve to be pardoned
o heroic one a woman who is entreated by her sagacious and praiseworthy husband loses both the worlds
o righteous one i know the path of dharma i also know that you are a truthful afflicted with grief on account of my son i spoke somewhat harshly
grief destroys fortitude grief destroys knowledge of the scriptures grief destroys everything there is no enemy equal to grief
one can endure an unexpected blow from the enemys hand but to endure unexpected grief however slight it may be is impossible
o heroic one even learned ascetics who are well versed in ethics and scriptures and who are free from doubts with regard to dharma and artha are deluded by grief
this is the fifth night of ramas exile but it is like five years to me whose joy has been destroyed by sorrow
as i think of rama my heart swells with sorrow just as the ocean rises with rushing rivers
while kausalya was speaking these hearttouching words the rays of the sun began to fade and the night fell
waking up in a moment tormented with grief the king began to ponder once again
indralike dasaratha due to banishment of rama and lakshmana was besieged by a great calamity like the sun enveloped by demonic dark at the time of eclipse
after rama had left along with his wife the king of kosala dasaratha recollected his former evil deed and wanted to narrate it to the darkeyed kausalya
after the banishment of rama the king spent the sixth night recalling the evil deed done by him in the past
king dasaratha distressed by the separation from his son pondered over his past misdeed and said to helpless kausalya who was equally grieving over the separation from rama
o gentle auspicious lady a man has to reap the fruit of his action good or evil
he who at the commencement of any action does not foresee the good or evil consequences of his action in considered a child
if some one cuts down mango trees and plants palasa trees and waters them will repent when he sees only flowers while he expects fruit
without foreseeing the fruits of his action he who runs after action only will regret at the time of fruition like the one who waters the palasa tree
so i have cut the mango trees and watered palasa trees in utter foolishness i have banished rama at the time of fruition and regretting later
o kausalya in my youth i was a great archer who could hit the target by its sound as such i committed this sin
just as a boy consumes poison out of delusion o devi this sorrow has befallen me as a result of my own action
like some one who is deluded by palasa trees i too did not realise the consequences of shooting the target following the direction of the sound
o kausalya you were not married then i was prince regent the rainy season that inflames passion and pride had just set in
having sucked the waters of the earth and scorching the world with its rays the sun had entered the frightful southern quarter ranged by departed souls
at that time the heat subsided glistening clouds appeared the frogs geese and peacocks began to rejoice
the birds with their plummage moistened as if they had dipped in water reached with great difficulty the tops of the trees which were shaken by the wind and rain
engulfed by torrents of rain that continued to fall ceaselessly the mountain visited by intoxicated antelopes looked like a mass of water
although pure the rapidly flowing water from the mountains mixed with the minerals in the soil turned white and red in colour and flowed like a serpent
the streams that were pure mixed with red soil flowed red deviating from their natural course
in that highly delightful season wishing to go hunting i armed with bow and arrows rode my chariot towards river sarayu
and there with no control over my senses i hid in a lonely place with my bow in readiness intending to shoot a buffalo or an elephant or any other wild animal that might come to the spot for drinking water in the night
hiding and waiting there following the sounds of animals i killed two animals that had reached the bank of the river
then at a place that was out of the range of my sight in darkness i heard the sound of a pitcher being filled with water which resembled the sound of an elephant
wishing to kill the elephant i seized my arrow glowing like a venomous snake and aimed it towards the sound
then i discharged a sharp shaft like a venomous serpent in the morning twilight i saw that the shaft had hit the vital part of the body of a forest dweller and his cry of alas was clearly heard as he fell in the water
when the arrow hit him a mans voice was heard saying how can an arrow be discharged at a person like me who is an ascetic
i have come to this lonely spot of the river to take water who has hit me with this arrow what harm have i done to any one
renouncing violence i live the life of an ascetic on forest produce why should any one kill me with a weapon
who wants to kill me who lives like an ascetic with matted hair and wearing bark or the skin of an antelope what harm have i done to him
whoever it is he has committed only a mischievous and senseless act this sin like a disciple sleeping on the bed of his preceptor none will approve of
i do not regret so much about the loss of my own life as about my mother and father after i am dead
so long i have been supporting this aged couple after i am dead how will they live
my aged parents along with me are killed by a single arrow who is that malicious knave who has slain us
on hearing the piteous voice the bow and arrow dropped from my trembling hands since i was keen on following the righteous path
having heard his pathetic lamentations at night i was extremely frightened by the force of grief and stood bewildered
with dissipated energy and intensely troubled mind i reached the bank of river sarayu and there i saw the ascetic lying struck by the arrow and with scattered locks of hair the water pitcher was thrown away and his body smeared with blood and dust as he lay on the ground
i was mentally stricken and frightened he looked up as if buring me with the energy of his eyes then he uttered the words a cruel act
o king you have struck me when i was trying to carry water to my parents i am a forestdweller what harm have i done to you
by striking at the vital part of my body with one arrow you have killed both my aged and blind mother and father too
how will the two who are frail thirsty and blind wait for me for long controlling their thirst with great difficulty with the expectation that i would fetch them water
my father does not know that i am lying on the ground it is true that there is no reward either for asceticism or for scriptural knowledge
what can my weak father who has no strength to walk do even if he knows about it like a tree which cannot protect another which is being severed he is helpless
o scion of the raghus dasaratha go at once and inform my father lest in anger he should burn you like ignited fire consuming the forest
o king this footpath leads to my fathers hermitage go and beg his forgiveness so that he may not curse you out of anger
gently remove the arrow from my body o king the sharp arrow is piercing deep into my vital just like the current of the river hits its elevated bank
the thought of removing the arrow kept me pondering if not removed it will be painful and if removed he will die
the son of the ascetic noticed my anguish and seeing me thus distressed wretched and afflicted with sorrow said
suffering from excruciating pain sinking with his limbs twisting and writhing and plunging into death and destruction with intense agony he uttered the following words with great difficulty
i am now calm i bear my pain with patience remove the fear from your mind that you have committed a sin by slaying a brahmin
o king dasaratha lord of the land i am not a brahmin feel no sense of guilt in your mind i was born of a sudra mother and a vaisya father
grieving for having unfairly killed the great sage the rightenous descendant of the raghus dasaratha coutinued to tell kausalya about it
having committed the sin unwittingly i was greatly agitated i reflected in my mind as to how to atone for this great sin
holding the pot filled with clean water i reached the hermitage following the path as directed
there i found his weak blind old parents with no supporter they looked like birds with clipped wings they sat there helplessly like orphans and passively talking about their son their only hope that i have deprived them of
smitten with grief and my heart throbbing with fear i reached the hermitage and my sorrow became manifold
hearing the sound of my footsteps the sage said o son why have you delayed bring me some water quickly
o dear child whatever be the reason you have been sporting in the water so long come at once to the hermitage your mother is anxious
o child o son if your mother or i have done anything disagreeable do not take it to heart for you are an ascetic
you are a support to the supportless eyes to the blind you are our very vital life why dont you speak to us
as i saw him my heart was filled with terror and i stammered as i spoke in garbled sentences
after a lot of effort with great fear controlling my thoughts and the power of speech i related to him the calamity that had befallen his son
o magnanimous sage i am a kshatriya known as dasaratha i am not your son a pathetic incident has been caused by my own action condemnable by the virtuous
wishing to hunt a wild elephant coming down to the water hole for drinking i went to the bank of sarayu bow in hand o revered sage
there i heard the sound of a pot being filled with water and mistaking it to be an elephants shot an arrow
thereafter i reached the river bank and beheld an ascetic with an arrow pierced in his chest he was lying on the ground his life ebbing away
o venerable one i released an arrow towards the water aiming at the sound intending to kill an elephant but it hit your son
then i approached him he was suffering from excruciating pain i pulled out at his word the arrow from his chest
grieving for both of you and crying you are blind he died as soon as the arrow was pulled out
your son has been killed by me due to my ignorance since this has happened may the ascetic be pleased to command me on the next course of action
the venerable sage heard my cruel words about the sinful act and was not able to seriously react he was stunned
the griefstricken glorious ascetic with his face filled with tears heaving deep sighs broke down with grief and spoke to me as i was standing with folded palms
o king hadnt you yourself broken this inauspicious news your head would have split into a hundred thousand pieces right now
if a kshatriya kills any one knowingly particularly when in vanaprastha third stage this sin can displace even indra wielder of the thunderbolt from his position o king
if any one deliberately discharges a weapon upon an ascetic observing austerities or on him who expounds the vedas his head will split into seven pieces
since you have done this unwittingly you are still alive if it had been otherwise your ikshvaku race itself would have been exterminated what to speak of you
o king take us to that place we wish to have the last look at him at his garment of antelope skin in disarray his body spattered with blood lying on the ground unconscious under the sway of the lord of death thus the sage said to me
thereupon i took both of them all by myself to that spot and made the grieving ascetics touch the body of their son
both the ascetics stroking their sons body and collapsed upon it and the father said
o child why are you not greeting us today nor speaking why are you lying on the ground are you angry with us
o righteous son if i am no longer dear to you at least look at your mother o tender child why are you not embracing me speak
from whom shall i hear the sweet recitation of scriptures or other texts delightful to my heart in the last watch of the night
o son i am tortured with sorrow and fear who will serve me from now on after the ablution and the morning worship of sandhya followed by oblations to the sacrificial fire
i am incapable of doing any work i am unable to procure anything to meet my needs now i have no guide to help me walk my way who will feed me like a welcome guest with tubers and fruits
o son how can i support your wretched and pitiable mother who is blind old and yearning for her son
my dear son stay with me do not go now to the abode of yama lord of death tomorrow accompanied by me and your mother you may
there seeing yama lord of death i shall say o lord of justice forgive me let this boy continue to maintain his parents
that lord of justice who is highly renowned righteous and the guardian of the worlds will grant me one unfailing boon of protection from fear
o sinless son you are killed by a person of sinful deeds on this truth quickly go to those worlds which are attained by those valiant heroes
you will attain my son the same supreme state achieved by sagara saibya dilipa janamejaya nahusha and dundumara
you my son shall attain that supreme state obtained by those who are virtuous who study the vedas and practise asceticismyou shall attain the state merited by those bestowers of land as charity who kindle the sacred fires who are monoganists who offer a thousand cows in charity who nurture the venerable and who willingly lay down their bodies
he who has killed you will alone attain that undesirable state a member of our family will not
in this way the ascetic piteously wailed again and again thereafter he with his wife set about to perform the funeral obsequies of their son
the virtuous son of that ascetic assumed a celestial form through the merit of his good deeds and ascended heaven at once with indra
the ascetic in the company of indra consoling the aged couple for a brief moment said
i have attained this supreme state by virtue of the service rendered to you you will also attain my state soon
the sages son with his senses under control said this while ascending heaven on a beautiful celestial aerial chariot
the radiant ascetic along with his wife hurriedly completed the funeral libations and said to me standing with folded palms
kill me o king with the same arrow by which you rendered me childless death holds no pain for me
though you have killed my purehearted son unintentionally i will pronounce a disastrous and dreadful curse on you
just as i am now suffering from grief caused by my sons death you o king shall die from the sorrow on account of separation from your son
since you o lord of men you have killed an ascetic unaware as kshatriya the sin of slaying a brahmin will not accrue to you immediately
just like the merits of alms come to the giver you are going to face very soon a dreadful situation causing the end of your life
having thus cursed me the couple piteously lamenting for a long time laid themselves down on the funeral pyre and went to heaven
while reflecting about it now o devi kausalya i recollect this sin committed by me unintentionally with childish pranks while practising the art of hitting a target by its sound
just as a man eating forbidden food and drink falls sick so have i fallen prey to grief because of my sin o devi
o gentle lady the words of that noble ascetic have come true today hence i am now going to give up my life
o kausalya i cannot see you with my eyes touch me gently said the frightened dasaratha lord of the earth to his wife weeping
whatever i have done to the scion of the raghu family rama is befitting me o devi and whatever he has done in respect of me is also worthy of him
which clearsighted man in this world will abandon his son even if he is of evil conduct which son will not get angry with his father when he is banished
before i die will rama touch me once or will he come to me after reaching the abode of yama men cannot see their relations
o kausalya i am unable to see you my memory is failing and the messengers of yama are hastening me
can there be a greater sorrow than that at the last moment of my life i am unable to see my righteous and truthful son rama
my grief in the absence of rama of peerless deeds is drying up my life as heat dries up small pools of water
those who will behold ramas countenance adorned with auspicious earrings on his return in the fifteenth year are gods not men
blessed are they who will behold ramas countenance resembling the moon lord of the stars with eyes like lotus petals graceful eyebrows even teeth and a nose
fortunate indeed are the men who will behold my sons fragrant countenance camparable to the autmnal moon and the fullblown lotus
lucky men will behold rama return to ayodhya after the completion of his exile like the planet venus moving forward on its orbit
o kausalya my heart it appears is sinking and on account of delusion i am not able to feel the sense objects like sound touch and taste together
with the loss of my mental faculty all the sense organs are giving way like the rays of the lamp giving way together when the oil is exhausted
this selfcreated grief is rapidly destroying me like the bank of a river eroded by its swift current leaving me helpless and insensible
ah mightyarmed rama destroyer of my agonies ah the delight of your father ah my protector ah my son where have you gone
ah kausalya ah pitiable sumitra ah cruel kaikeyi my enemy and defiler of my race i am going to die
king dasaratha thus crying in distress in the presence of ramas mother and sumitra reached the end of his life
king dasaratha a man of noble vision and lord of men anguished by the exile of his son kept pitiably muttering till past midnight until tormented by an intense agony he breathed his last     thus ends the sixtyfourth sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
then on the following day unaware of dasarathas death panegyrists uttering benedictions highly accomplished bards and genealogists proficient in reciting auspicious words singers versed in musical science reached the palace one after another eulogising the kings glory
the songs of those who were eulogising the king and uttering benedictions at high pitch pervaded the entire palace
while the bards sang the praise of the king those who praise clapping their palms clapped citing the wonderful deeds of dasaratha
the birds perched on the branches and some in cages awoke and began to twitter all over the palace
the sacred songs of bards and panegyrists notes of veena chantings of metrical hymns and benedictory verses filled the palace
thereafter as usual men observing purificatory practices and skilled in royal service assembled along with women and eunuchs
the bathattendants brought water mixed with yellow sandal paste in golden vessels at appropriate times in accordance with tradition
also a group of women mostly young maidens brought auspicious unguents articles gratifying the senses and those necessary accessories for completion of bathing process
all the articles brought for the king for his bath were presentable and as per tradition in quality they were excellent and auspicious
all the highly enthusiastic attendants waited for the king till sunrise unable to see the king they doubted about what had happened
the women who usually attend to the bed maids who do the bed in the morning of dasaratha king of kosala without any restrictions approached the king and began waking him up
conducting themselves agreeably with restraint and obedience the women touched the bed of dasaratha but did not perceive any sign of life
those women knowledgeable in ascertaining the nature of sleep based on the actions movements etc were apprehensive whether the king was alive or not trembling severely they seemed like the tips of reeds that stand against the current
having seen the king more closely those women who were apprehensive till then became certain of the inevitable
overpowered by grief on account of separation from their sons sumitra and kausalya were fast asleep and did not wake up as if they were possessed by death
kausalya with her face dull and pallid sank down her limbs contracted she looked lustreless like stars enveloped in darkness
there lay sumitra next to kausalya by the side of the king queen kausalyas face was dull drooping down on account of shedding tears of sorrow
having seen the two auspicious queens asleep the women in the inner apartment thought the king died in his sleep
then those women bewailed bitterly and loudly in distress like female elephants in the forest when their leader has fallen out of the herd
hearing the lamentations of the women suddenly kausalya and sumitra woke up from sleep their senses recovered
kausalya and sumitra looked at the king touched his body cried aloud ah lord and collapsed on the floor
kausalya daughter of the lord of kosala lay on the ground writhing in pain coated with dust and devoid of brightness like a star without radiance fallen from the sky
dasaratha with his body lying still all the women looked at kausalya fallen down on the floor like a slain female elephant
then all the wives of the king led by kaikeyi burning with grief and weeping lost their senses and fell down
the wailings of the women grew louder and louder until the whole palace reverberated with their lamentations
on the demise of dasaratha joy instantly vanished the palace was thronged with anxious people who were exceedingly bewildered and frightened the royal family was anguished with distress the palace was filled all over with the tumult of cries of agony and it looked miserable with grief
realising that the great and illustrious king dasaratha had passed away his wives gathered around him weeping piteously and bitterly and holding one anothers hands bewailed like orphans     thus ends the sixtyfifth sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
on seeing the king who ascended the heaven just as a blazing fire suddenly extinguishes or like the ocean emptied of water or the sun bereft of splendour kausalya raised the head of the king on to her lap her eyes filled with tears and body shrunk in sorrow looked at kaikeyi and said
o cruel one o perverse wretch o kaikeyi your wishes have been fulfilled you have forsaken the king that was your only objective now enjoy the kingdom alone without any obstacles on your way
rama has gone away leaving me my lord has ascended the heaven traversing the wrong road with my wellwishers gone i do not want to live
which woman wishes to live leaving her godlike husband except kaikeyi who has given up her sense of duty
like a greedy man who eats the poisonous kimpaka fruit without realising the defects of the fruit kaikeyi has destroyed the raghu race on account of the hunchback manthara
hearing the unrighteous action ordered by the king in banishing rama and his wife king janaka will suffer great agony like me
that virtuous rama of lotuspetaleyes has left this place for good and does not know that i am without a protector being a widow now
in the same way sita daughter of the king of videha who does not deserve hardships will be in deep agony
hearing the ghastly sounds of animals and birds sita will surely get frightened and take shelter in rama
old and sonless janaka constantly thinking of sita and overpowered with grief will surely give up his life
as his faithful wife i shall enter the fire by clasping this dasarathas body and go to death today itself
the servants led away that unfortunate kausalya who was lamenting in great anguish embracing the body of dasaratha
the counsellors instructed by vasistha and others placed the kings body in an oil tub with the understanding that the funeral rites were to be performed hereafter
the counsellors who were acquainted with all such matters relating to the kings funeral were unwilling to perform the obsequies in the absence of any of the kings sons meanwhile they kept watch over the deadbody of the king
on seeing the kings body laid in the oil vat by the counsellors the women cried alas the king is dead
with tears flowing down their faces piteously raising their arms groaning in their burning grief the women lamented helplessly
when we were already deprived of rama who was always pleasing and truthful alas o great king why did you leave us
a woman of evil intentions kaikeyi at first separated us from rama now she deprived us of our husband how can we live with one who is a slayer of her husband
rama who was always our and your selfpossessed master and protector has gone to the forest indeed abandoning royal wealth
without you and without the heroic rama how can we live overwhelmed with grief and enduring the abuses of kaikeyi
why will not kaikeyi who has abandoned the king valiant rama and lakshmana along with sita cast aside others
the excellent wives of dasaratha overwhelmed with profound grief and tears are lying unconcious on the floor
like night without the moon like a woman forsaken by her husband this city of ayodhya without that magnanimous king has lost its earlier splendour
with the people of ayodhya shedding tears the housewives crying in anguish alas alas the courtyards houses and squares of the roads deserted the city has lost its earlier brilliance
when king dasaratha ascended to heaven due to grief over his son and when his wives were lying on the ground the sun ceased his journey and the night favourable to creatures of darkness suddenly set in
the wellwishers who asembled unwilling to ignite the funeral pyre of the king in the absence of any one of his sons laid the kings deadbody in that oil trough in an unexpected manner
the city bereft of illustrious dasaratha was filled with people sobbing in the courtyards in front of their houses and in the squares in between that city of ayodhya bereft of brightness appeared like the day without the sun and the night without constellations of stars
after the demise of the king men and women in the city assembled in groups and denounced the mother of bharata extremely distressed they had no peace of mind      thus ends the sixtysixth sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
the night stretched interminably in ayodhya which was filled with sobbing people rendered cheerless by their lamentations
when the night finally ended and after the sunrise next day the brahmins who perform royal investiture having been called and reached the assembly hall
markandeya maudgalya kasyapa katyayana gautama jabali of great renown accompanied by ministers and brahmins approached vasistha the chief priest of the king and expressed different opinions on the investiture
while king dasaratha died on account of grief over separation from his son and rejoined the five elements the sorrowful night seemed like a hundred years for us commented the assembly of ministers
the great king has attained heaven rama has taken refuge in the forest and brilliant lakshmana has also gone with rama
bharata and satrughna destroyers of enemies are at the beautiful city of rajagriha in the kekaya kingdom the palace of their maternal grandfathers palace
therefore let someone from the race of ikshvakus be appointed king right now since without a king the country will be destroyed
in a country without a king thunderous clouds garlanded by lightning would no longer water the earth with celestial showers
where there is no king even a handful of seeds will not be sown will not sprout in a kingless kingdom a son or a wife will not obey the father head of the family
in a kingdom without a king wealth cannot be preserved no wife would like to stay with her husband there is one more cause for a great peril that is there is no place for truth in a country where there is no king
in a country where there is no king no assemblies are convened by pleasure seeking people nor do they build delightful gardens or sacred edifices
in a country without a king selfcontrolled brahmins in charge of sacrificial ceremonies wellversed in the study of vedas and strict followers of austerity will not function
in a country without a king wealthy brahmins who have performed great sacrifices do not offer abundance of gifts to the officiating priests
in a country without a king celebrations of associations promoting the welfare of the country actors and dancers in large numbers do not prosper
where there is no king those engaged in lawsuits will not succeed and those who are accustomed to storytelling will not entertain those who love to listen to stories
in a country without a king young ladies adorned with golden ornaments no longer meet in the evening at the pleasure garden for sporting
in a country without a king pleasureseeking men will not drive in the woods on swiftmoving chariots with women
in a country without a king wealthy people who live on farming and raising cattle cannot sleep safely in their homes with doors wide open
in a country without a king young elephants of sixty years of age their tusks adorned with bells no longer wander about on the highways
in a country without a king the sounds of the ceaseless discharge of arrows and practice of weapons the clappings of the cord on the skin shield of shooters throwing the arrows are no longer heard
in a country without a king merchants travelling long distances with several kinds of saleable goods cannot go safely on their way
in a country where there is no king an ascetic who normally moves alone selfcontrolled and contemplating on the higher self no longer wanders or rests in the inn
in a country without a king there is no security of possessions and the army cannot withstand the enemy in a battle
in a country without a king welldressed men are no longer enthusiastic to drive on excellent horses and on chariots
in a country with no king people proficient in scriptures do not withdraw to the forests and recreational gardens for debates on scriptures
in a country where there is no king people who are disciplined in spiritual practices do not offer garlands of flowers sweetmeats and alms while worshipping gods
in a country where there is no king the princes anointed with sandal paste and agaru no longer look graceful like blosoming trees in spring time
the kingdom without a king is like rivers without water forests without vegetation and cows without cowherds
in a country where there is no king no one can own anything and like fish people devour one another ceaselessly
atheists who disregard the bounds of morality and live freely dispelling doubts will tend to follow virtuous path out of fear when subjected to royal punishment
the king is the source for protecting the truth and morality of a country like the eye which perpetually watches the welfare of the body
the king is the protector of truth and righteousness of men of good families he is father and mother he alone renders welfare of the people
hence the king with his excellent conduct surpasses mighty yama vaisravana indra and varuna
if the king did not show the distinction between the good and evil actions this world would have been enveloped by darkness nothing could have been seen how great is the king
even while the great king was alive we never defied your word like the ocean which does not overstep its shore
o vasistha the best of brahmins considering all that has happened and knowing that a kingdom without a king is like a forest you may consecrate a generous son from the ikshvaku race as our king     thus ends the sixtyseventh sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
having listened to their the counsellors words vasistha replied to the host of friends and counsellors of the king and to all the brahmins
bharata on whom the kingdom has been conferred is living comfortably in his maternal uncles house let swift messengers go quickly on speeding horses and bring back the valiant brothers bharata and satrughna what is there to deliberate for us in this matter
let the messengers go said all of them to vasistha on hearing this vasistha replied again
calling siddhartha vijaya jayanta asoka and nandana vasistha said all of you listen to what is required to be done by you
go at once from here on swift horses to the city of rajagrha and concealing signs of grief convey these words to bharata as my command
the family priest and all the counsellors wish your welfare you must return in haste there is an urgent task required to be done by you
all of you go there and do not communicate to bharata about the exile of rama or the demise of his father and the disaster that has befallen the raghus
take with you silk garments and precious ornaments for the king of kekaya and bharata and depart at once
the messengers set to depart to kekaya kingdom carrying with them the necessaries for their journey went to their respective homes mounted on excellent horses
having completed the rest of the arrangements for the journey and permitted by vasistha the messengers left
the messengers proceeded in westerly direction for some distance and then crossed the southern end of the aparatala mountain thereafter they travelled northward along the bank of malini that flows in between aparatala and pralamba mountains
the messengers crossed ganga at hastinapura and went in the westerly direction through the middle of kurujangala and reached the country of panchala beholding lakes full of water and rivers of pellucid waters there they travelled fast with a view to fulfilling their mission
the messengers crossed the divine saradanda of calm waters frequented by fowls of various speices and thronged with people and proceeded speedily
they reached a divine tree of great powers known as satyopayachana tree and having gone round and paid homage they entered the kulinga city
from there they reached a village known as abhikala and crossed the sacred ikshumati flowing from bodhibhavana mountain this region was enjoyed by fathers and forefathers of dasaratha
there they saw the brahmins versed in the vedas and drank water with cupped palms then they continued their journey through the middle of bahlika country and reached sudama mountain
beholding the footprints of visnu on sudama mountain and seeing vipasa and salmali rivers trees streams deep wells ponds pools large tanks different kinds of lions tigers and elephants they travelled a long distance with the intention of fulfilling the command of their master
after a prolonged journey the messengers with their tired horses soon reached girivraja the capital city of kekaya kingdom best of cities
to please their master sage vasistha and to preserve the royal dynasty and also to protect the honour of the race and people the messengers soon reached their destination by night without any negligence of their duty     thus ends the sixtyeighth sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
on the very night the messengers were entering the city bharata had a distressing dream
the son of the king of kings bharata felt extremely troubled hen he had an unpleasant dream at dawn
observing him griefstricken his peers who always spoke pleasant words engaged him in a variety of ways in the assembly in order to divert him
in order to provide mental peace to bharata some played stringed instruments while some enacted dramatic scenes some danced and cracked various kinds of jokes
the magnanimous bharata born in the race of raghus was not delighted by the conversations and jokes and soothing words of his friends
addressing bharata amidst his companions some one close among them said o friend why are you dejected in spite of being in the company of friends
addressing his companion who was speaking thus bharata replied saying listen to the reason this desolation has overtaken me
in my dream i saw my father looking pale with dishevelled hair his body filled with filth falling from the peak of a mountain into a pool of cow dung
i saw my father floating in that pool of cow dung drinking oil with cupped palms and bursting into laughter again and again
thereafter i beheld him eating rice cooked with sesame seeds his body besmeared with oil plunging again and again into it the pool
in that dream i beheld the sea being dried up and the moon fallen onto the ground i saw the earth as though enveloped by darkness and obscured the tusk of an elephant worthy of a ride by the monarch broken into pieces a blazing fire extinguished suddenly the earth split open various trees dried up and mountains crumbled and covered with smoke
in the dream i beheld my father clad in black clothes and resting on a seat made of iron and the women in dark and brownish complexion laughing at him
thereafter i beheld that virtuous monarch bedecked with garlands made of red flowers and his body bedaubed with red sandalpaste hurrying off southward on a chariot yoked with asses
finally i beheld a demoness attired in red clothes with an ugly appearance dragging the king away as if mocking at him
i had such a frightful dream last night either i rama the king or lakshmana might die
if one beholds in a dream a person setting out on a carriage yoked to asses the wreath of smoke ascending from his funeral pyre will be seen soon
so it is for this reason that i am desolate and cannot respond well to your conversation it appears as if my throat is getting parched up and my mind is illdisposed
i do not see any reason for apprehension but i experience only fear my voice has degenerated my appearance looks haggard without any reason whatsoever i detest myself
on observing the course of this nightmare with all those images formerly unconceived and having thought of the kings incomprehensible presence a great fear that has gripped my heart does not leave me     thus ends the sixtyninth sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
while bharata was relating his dream the mounted messengers from ayodhya with their weary horses entered the lovely city of rajagriha surrounded by an impassable moat there they met the king of kekaya country and his son yuddhajit and were received with honour touching the feet of the king with reverence they said to bharata
the family priest vasistha and all the counsellors have enquired about your welfare you must return immediately there is an urgent matter to be attended by you
oh largeeyed one bharata you are asked to take these excellent raiments and precious ornaments and bestow them on your maternal uncle said the messengers
o prince these gifts worth twenty crore are intended for the king and the rest of the gifts worth ten crore for your maternal uncle
affectionate towards his relatives and friends bharata received all those gifts and in return honoured those messengers with things they liked asking them
i hope my father dasaratha is doing well and revered rama and lakshmana are in good health
i hope kausalya mother of the sagacious rama the venerable lady devoted to righteousness one who knows the ways of righteousness and observes the prescribed code of conduct is keeping sound health
i hope my mother sumitra the middle one who is familiar with the ways of righteousness the mother of valiant lakshmana and satrughna is enjoying good health
and what about my mother kaikeyi ever intent on her own wellbeing wrathful irascible and proud of her intelligence is she maintaining sound health
having listened to the words of that magnanimous bharata those messengers addressed him gracefully with these words
o tiger among men bharata those of whose welfare you are enquiring are all doing well may the goddess of wealth and prosperity await you and let your chariot be yoked
having thus been addressed bharata said to the messengers let me seek the permission of the great king of kekaya to leave and say goodbye informing him that the messengers are hastening me up
having addressed the messengers who were pressing him to leave for ayodhya bharata said to his maternal grandfather
o king urged by these messengers i wish to go to my father i shall come back again from ayodhya whenever you remember me
then the king of kekaya the maternal grandfather of bharata having heard the words of the scion of the raghu dynasty bharata kissed him on his forehead and spoke these auspicious words
you may go my child i permit you to leave kaikeyi has a worthy son in you o slayer of enemies convey my best wishes to your mother and father
my child convey my best wishes too to your family priest vasistha and other illustrious brahmins and also to those two great bowmen rama and lakshmana
the king of kekaya felicitated bharata out of affection and bestowed on him wellbred elephants manycoloured blankets antelope skins and riches
king of kekaya generously gave to the son of kaikeyi bharata in his honour two thousand gold coins and sixteen hundred horses
similarly his maternal uncle ashwapati quickly presented him amenable trustworthy and virtuous counsellors as companions on his return journey
his maternal uncle gave him the wealth of goodlooking elephants born in iravata and indrasira mountains and swiftmoving and welltrained asses which can be yoked easily he gave riches too
he also gave him a gift of wellraised dogs of the inner apartment hugebodied with the strength and courage of tigers who used their fangs as weapons
all the wealth given by the king of kekaya did not delight bharata son of kaikeyi who was in a hurry to depart for ayodhya
then his heart was filled with extreme anxiety due to the haste of the messengers to depart and also due to the dream he had
prosperous bharata on leaving his residence passed through incomparable royal highway thronged with men elephants and horses
then the nobleminded prosperous bharata on leaving the highway saw the inner apartment of the king which he entered unhindered
thus having taken leave of his maternal grandfather and uncle yuddhajit bharata accompanied by satrughna boarded the chariot and went along
and the servants harnessing more than a hundred chariots of wellrounded wheels and also camels oxen and horses followed bharata who started off
under the protection of the army the illustrious bharata who was devoid of enemies accompanied by ministers who were comparable to him and satrughna departed from his venerable grandfathers house like a siddha leaving the regions of indra      thus ends the seventieth sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
not finding his father in his abode bharata went to see his mother in her apartment
on seeing her son who was sent away presently arriving the delighted kaikeyi sprang up from her golden seat
on entering home the righteous bharata found it devoid of cheer and touched the auspicious feet of his mother with reverence
kaikeyi gave her illustrious son bharata a hug kissed him on his forehead made him rest on her lap and began her query
how many nights have you spent on the way since you left your noble grandfathers residence hasnt the hurried journey over such a long distance on the chariot left you exhausted
my son are your revered grandfather and your maternal uncle yudhajit doing well did you have a pleasant time during the sojourn you should tell me all this
thus asked lovingly by his mother kaikeyi the lotuseyed bharata the kings delight narrated everything to her
this is the seventh night since i left my noble grandsires residence my mothers father king of kekaya and my maternal uncle yudhajit are doing well
the horses carrying the wealth including the gems which the king of kekaya the subduer of enemies had bestowed on me were exhausted on the way therefore i have come in advance
urged upon by the messengers carrying out the orders of the king i have come you o mother should answer the questions i wish to ask you
your goldbedecked couch worthy of resting lies empty none of the attendants of the ikshvakus look cheerful
i had come here with the hope to see king dasaratha who spends most of his time in my mothers residence but today i do not see him
i would like to pay obeisance at my fathers feet will you answer my question o mother and tell me regarding his whereabouts or perchance could he be at the residence of my eldest mother kausalya
in spite of knowing everything kaikeyi actuated by greed for the kingdom broke the unpleasant and dreadful news as if it were pleasing to bharata who was ignorant of what had transpired
your highsouled brilliant father ever engaged in performing sacrifices and a refuge for the virtuous people went the inevitable way every living being must follow attained heaven
on hearing these words he bharata born of a righteous race and endowed with purity of character was shattered by the immense grief of his fathers demise and dropped down instantaneously on the floor
the mightyarmed valiant bharata uttering pitiable words evoking compassion alas i am finished fell down at once throwing up his arms
overwhelmed with grief radiant bharata reeling with delusion due to sorrow lamented over the death of his father
this couch of my father once used to shine like the spotless night sky irradiated by the autumnal moon
but today this couch without my sagacious father no longer shines like the sky without the moon or like the sea evaporated
bharata the foremost among the victorious clearing his tearchoked throat and covering his auspicious countenance with raiment wept in profound distress with tears overflowing
anguished and griefstricken he who resembled the gods fell down on the ground like a trunk of the sala tree in the forest severed by an axe seeing her son who was like a mighty elephant or like the sun or the moon kaikeyi lifted him up from the ground and spoke these words
o illustrious prince arise arise why are you lying down on the floor learned people like you who are worthy of honour in the assembly ought not to grieve like this
o highly intelligent one by your wisdom virtuous conduct and scriptural knowledge you are entitled to dispense charity and perform sacrifices you will always shine incessantly like light of the sun
bharata engulfed in profuse sorrow wept for a long time rolling on the ground and then said these words in reply to his mother
thinking that the king is about to consecrate rama or perform some sacrifice i undertook the journey in great delight
now everything has turned out to be different my mind is shatteredi no longer behold my father who is ever intent on my welfare and happiness
o mother what ailment caused the kings death before i could return how fortunate are rama and others by whom the last rites of my father were performed
where is that hand of my father of unwearied actions the hand that would wipe away the dust from my person with a pleasant touch
announce at once my arrival to the wise rama the man of unwearied actions my brother father and friend whose slave i am
to one who knows the ways of righteouness the elder brother is like the father indeed he rama is my refuge and i shall hold his feet now
what did my father the noble king conversant with righteous conduct true to his vows one who always conducted himself in a righteous manner whose truth was his prowess at the time of his death
i want to hear the exact words of my fathers last message to me thus questioned by bharata kaikeyi related the exact facts
the magnanimous king the foremost of those who attained the excellent state after death went to the other world lamenting o rama o sita o lakshamana
your father caught by the noose of death like a great elephant bound by cords uttered these last words
those men who will see rama returning home along with sita and mightyarmed lakshmana will have their desires fulfilled
bharata was more distraught on hearing the words that conveyed the second unpleasant tidings with downcast countenance he again enquired of his mother thus
where has righteous rama who enhances the delight of kausalya along with his brother lakshmana and sita gone now
thus questioned his mother started relating the exact events presuming them to be pleasant tidings for bharata
o my son prince rama attired in garments of bark along with sita and followed by lakshmana left for the great dandaka forest
conscious of the glory of his race bharata continued to enquire if there was any unrighteous conduct on the part of his brother
i hope rama did not seize the wealth of any brahmin nor did any harm to an innocent person whether rich or poor
i hope he did not covet another mans wife like a sinner who had slain a child in embryo why has he been banished to dandaka forest
then the capricious mother with the same feminine disposition which she had displayed earlier started giving a faithful account of all her deeds
on hearing the words of great bharata that foolish woman kaikeyi thinking herself to be wise cheerfully said
rama did not rob any brahmin of even a little wealth nor did he harm any innocent man whether rich or poor he never casts his eyes on anothers wife
my son i on hearing of ramas consecration asked your father to confer the kingdom on you and banish rama
your father faithful to his word banished rama along with lakshmana and sita
the renowned ruler of the earth king dasaratha unable to behold the sorry state of his beloved son and stricken by filial grief merged into the five elements died
o knower of dharma assume kingship now it is only for your sake that all this has been done by me
my son give up sorrow and agony and take recourse to courage this city as well as the kingdom free from all obstacles is under your control
on hearing about the demise of the father and his two brothers sent in exile bharata overtaken by sorrow spoke thus
bereft of my father and my brother who was like a father to me of what avail is this kingdom to me when i am grieving and fallen into misfortunes
you have caused the death of the king and reduced rama to an ascetic you have piled one sorrow over sorrow on me like rubbing salt to the wound
you have come here for the destruction of this race like a fatal night my father did not realize that he was embracing a live charcoal
o woman of sinful thoughts you have brought about the death of my father o obloquy of the race by your folly you have deprived this family of its happiness
my father king dasaratha who is bound to truth and highly renowned having come under your influence and tormented by intense grief has departed from this world
why was my father the righteous maharaja killed why was rama exiled into the forest
tormented by the grief of separation from their sons it is difficult for kausalya and sumitra to survive under you o my mother
my noble and righteous brother rama who is well aware of his duties to the elders conducted himself before you as he would before his own mother
you have forced kausalyas son so pure in mind to wear garments made of bark and dwell in the forest do you not feel remorse for it o perverse wretch
the glorious valiant selfpossessed rama had never contemplated evil what possible reason do you have for sending him clothed in bark into exile
being avaricious you are i think unaware of my devotion to rama this great calamity has been brought about by you for your greed for the kingdom
when rama and lakshmana the best of men stay away from me by virtue of what mighty power am i competent to protect this kingdom
the mighty and righteous maharaja used to rely upon the powerful rama just as mount meru depends on the forest surrounding it for its protection
like a young untrained bullock that cannot carry the weight fit for a great bull with what strength can i bear this burden
if i gather the strength to carry the burden either by employing the four expedients available to a king against an enemy or by the power of intellect i will not allow you covetous of your son to fulfil your ambition
had rama not treated you as his own mother i would not have the slightest hesitation to renounce you a lady of sinful disposition
o woman of sinful thoughts fallen from virtuous conduct how did you entertain this thought reproachable to our ancestors
in our race only the eldest son is installed in the kingdom and the other brothers behave with utmost respect towards him
o cruel one i suppose neither have you any respect for the royal tradition nor are you aware of the everlasting benefit that ensues in following the royal traditon
according to the established law of royalty the eldest son is invariably crowned in the kingdom this is true of all kings this is a special tradition of the kings of the ikshvaku race
as for the ikshvaku kings righteousness is their sole protection they follow the ancestral traditions befitting the noble race this tradition has been topsyturvied by admitting you into the family
even the kings in your ancestral family were highly distinguished men how did this condemnable deflection originate in your mind
o woman of sinful disposition i on my part will not fulfil your cherished desire you have started a distressing deed to bring an end to my existence
to cause a great discomfiture for you right now i shall bring back my faultless brother the beloved of his people from the forest
with the effulgent rama brought back i shall serve him with a steadfast mind
having inflicted on his mother these unpleasant words in this manner the highsouled bharata overwhelmed with grief roared again like a lion in a mountaincave     thus ends the seventythird sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
overtaken by great wrath bharata reproached his mother and then said to her again
o cruel kaikeyi of wicked conduct you may be deprived of the kingdom abandoned by righteousness you shall be weeping for me after my death
death for the king and exile for rama similar fate for both have befallen on your account what possible harm either the king or the highly virtuous rama has done to you
o kaikeyi by destroying this race you have earned the demerit of killing an embryo and shall enter hell you shall never attain the same state of living in the afterworld of your husband
that by doing this horrible deed you have committed a great sin of renouncing rama the beloved of all worlds therefore i am overtaken by fear
you have caused my fathers death and ramas exile as for me i have obtained ignominy in this world
o cruel woman o woman of vicious character you are an enemy assuming a mothers form lustful for kingdom you are a murderess of your husband and i shall never speak to you
as you have vitiated the race my mothers kausalya and sumitra are overwhelmed with great sorrow
as you sent virtuous rama ever devoted to truth into the forest my father died out of grief due to separation from his son therefore you are not the true daughter of the righteous and sagacious king aswapati but a demoness born there to destroy your fathers race
the sin you have committed with a particular objective has affected me and as a result i am left without my father i am abandoned by my brothers i am hated by every one in this entire world
o woman of sinful convictions you will go to hell you have separated righteous kausalya from her son for having committed such a sin what afterworld awaits you is not known
o cruel one why do you not realise that rama born of kausalya is the eldest son and equal to my father he is selfrestrained and a refuge to his kith and kin
a son born from every limb big or small and from the heart is the most beloved of all for his mother while the other relatives are only loving ones
it is said that once upon a time surabhi the divine cow highly respected by the gods and conversant with righteous ways beheld her two sons who fainted due to fatigue while carrying the burden of the ploughs
on seeing her two sons lying on earth exhausted she wailed in distress for them with her eyes filled with tears
the fine drops of her fragnant tears trickled down the body of the great king of the gods indra
when indra lord of the gods saw those tears of holy fragrance fallen on his body he understood that the tears were shed by the venerated kamadhenu
while looking around indra beheld kamadhenu in intense pain stationed in the sky looking distressed and miserable and wailing
the king of the gods indra wielder of thunderbolt saw the renowned kamadhenu consumed with grief alarmed he said to her with palms joined in reverence
o holy cow fear not you wish the welfare of all has any great calamity befallen us from any quarter i hope not what is the reason for your sorrow tell me
on hearing the sagacious indra king of the gods kamadhenu proficient in speech calmly replied
god forbid o indra lord of the immortals no calamity has befallen you from any quarter only i am in trouble i am weeping for these pair of bulls my own sons who are in difficulty when i see them scorched by the rays of the sun miserable emaciated and weeping beaten by a ploughman i am immersed in grief
these bulls were born from my body and they are oppressed by the burden having seen their anguish i am extremely grieved there is none so dear as a son
the wishfulfilling cow kamadhenu had innumerable sons spread all over the world when indra saw that kamadhenu too was weeping for her sons he concluded there is no one greater than a son
wishing always to nourish the worlds kamadhenu conducts herself with an unequalled character in accordance with her nature she has imbibed in herself eminent virtues she is endowed with all prosperity in spite of her thousand sons she is weeping thus for her two bulls what can one say of kausalya separated from her only son will she be her normal self again
this pious lady is blessed with only one son and now has been rendered childless by you therefore you shall experience grief in this world and hereafter
as for me i shall do whatever is necessary for the atonement of the improper conduct shown towards my father and brother and for enhancement of my fame there is no doubt about it
if i fail to bring back the mighty son of kausalya i shall enter the forest frequented by ascetics
o vicious one o evilintentioned one being watched by the citizens with their throats choked with tears of grief i cannot endure the burden of the sin committed by you
jump into the fire or go to dandaka forest or hang yourself there is no other recourse for you
when rama who has truth as his prowess accepts the kingdom i shall have accomplished my purpose at last and i shall be free from all blemishes
in this way like an elephant driven by prods and goads in the forest highly enraged bharata hissing like a serpent dropped down on the ground
prince bharata the scorcher of enemies with bloodshot eyes raiment in disarray ornaments tossed about lay fallen on the ground like the banner of indra husband of sachi at the close of the festival of flaghoisting      thus ends the seventyfourth sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
on regaining his senses after a long time the valiant bharata looked at his unfortunate mother whose eyes were filled with tears and condemned her amidst the counsellors
neither did i ever desire the kingdom nor did i ever consult my mother in this regard and i am not even aware of the consecration that was planned by the king for i was away in a distant country with satrughna
i knew nothing of the banishment of great rama nor did i know how lakshmana or sita had gone on exile
as magnanimous bharata was wailing kausalya recognised his voice and said to sumitra
bharata the farsighted son of kaikeyi of cruel deeds has come and i wish to see him
having said so to sumitra kausalya trembling and almost lifeless emaciated sullied and turned pallid set out for the place where bharat was
but at the same time bharata the younger brother of rama accompanied by satrughna proceeded to the place where kausalya resided
then agonised bharata and satrughna beholding that venerable noblehearted griefstricken weeping kausalya who was almost semiconscious overcome with grief approached her with great sorrow and hugged her
looking at bharata the deeply afflicted kausalya said the kingdom which you had desired has been acquired without any obstacle alas kaikeyi had quickly secured it for you through her crooked act
what advantage did cruel kaikeyi visualize in sending away my son to dwell in the forest wearing robes of bark
kaikeyi should send me also without any delay to that place where my illustrious rama with golden navel dwells
or else i accompanied by sumitra shall go happily on my own holding the sacred fire in front to that place where rama dwells
or you should now take me personally to that place where my son rama the best among men is performing austerities
this vast kingdom with all its abundance of wealth and grain elephants horses and chariots has been delivered to you by her
thus reproached by many a harsh word like needle pricking a wound the sinless bharata was intensely pained
having heard these words his senses reeling he became unconscious lamented profusaly and fell at her feet and on regaining his senses he stood motionless
as kausalya was lamenting in this manner overwhelmed with deep grief bharata his palms joined in reverence replied her in these words

while thus appeasing kausalya deprived of her husband and son bharata filled with grief fell down at her feet
kausalya said these words to bharata who fell unconscious consumed with grief while swearing on painful oaths
o son by swearing on oaths you are choking the very breath of my life and my suffering has grown still more
o dear child fortunately your mind is unswerved from righteousness you being truthful to your promise shall attain the world of virtuous men along with lakshmana
after having addressed bharata who was affectionate towards his brother that way kausalya drew the mightyarmed one onto her lap and hugged him and cried out with extreme grief
afflicted by sorrow and lamenting thus great bharatas mind became unsteady owing to swooning and besieged by grief
vasistha the most eloquent and the best of ascetics said to bharata the son of kaikeyi who was tormented with grief
o prince of great renown may god bless you it is not proper on your part to grieve it is time to perform the funeral rites of the king in the best way possible
on hearing the words of vasistha dutiful bharata regained his steadiness and engaged in the performance of the funeral rites
the mortal remains of king dasaratha protector of the earth was taken out of the oil container and placed on the floor his pale yellow face appeared as if he was asleep thereafter it was laid upon a magnificent couch adorned with every kind of gem on seeing dasaratha in that state bharata lamented in extreme distress
what have you done o king between my absence and my arrival you have banished the righteous rama and the valiant lakshmana
o great king where will you go leaving me who is bewailing for having been left by rama the lion among men and a man of pious deeds
o king o father you have gone to heaven and rama has taken shelter in the forest now who will take care of the welfare and security of your city
o king bereft of you the earth kingdom is widowed and has lost its radiance the city appears to me like a moonless night
to bharata who was thus lamenting with a dejected mind the great ascetic vasistha once again said
o mightyarmed prince the funeral rites that are required to be performed for the departed king ought to be done carefully without any shortcomings
bharata said be it so in obedience to vasistha who hastened up the learned vedic scholars family priests and preceptors to perform various rites
the sacrificial fire of the king has been put outside the firesanctuary in accordance with the ritual precepts and were withdrawn by the attendants and priests wellversed in vedic lore
thereafter the attendants raised the mortal remains of the deceased king onto a litter with dejected minds throats choked with tears and carried him away
the people went ahead of the kings body strewing on the way gold of brilliant colour and different kinds of garments
in this way others brought sandal agaru and fragrant gum gugul the resin of balsa tree and woods of sarala padmaka and devadaru and built a pyre and strew many kinds of fragrant substances on it thereafter the priests laid the mortal remains of the king in the centre of the pyre
then the priests offering oblations to the kings fire intoned prayers the reciters of sama veda sang the hymns in accordance with the sacred scriptures
then in accordance with their rank and surrounded by aged guards the wives of king dasaratha departed for that place from the city in palanquins and other carriages
then the priests and other women led by kausalya who was consumed with grief circumambulated the pyre in the reverse direction as the kings body was engulfed by flames
at that time piteous cries of distressed women in their thousands like the piercing cries of female kraunchas birds were heard
thereafter the courtesans weeping uncontrollably and lamenting again and again alighted from carriages on the bank of the river sarayu
the wives of the king counsellors and priests along with bharata offered waterlibation and entered the city with tearful eyes they spent the tenday mourning period sleeping on the ground floor in great grief     thus ends the seventysixth sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
having observed the tenday mourning period bharata purified himself on the twelfth day and got the shraddha rites obsequies performed
during the shraddha ceremony obsequies bharata bestowed on brahmins precious stones wealth large quantities of rice highly valuable garments and various gems
at the time of performing the rites pertaining to the other world bharata bestowed on brahmins herds of white goats cows in hundreds male and female servants and spacious houses and carriages
thereafter at the hour of dawn on the thirteenth day mightyarmed bharata visited the cemetery to perform the purificatory ceremony approaching the place of the funeral pyre of his father he lamented in the intensity of grief
o dear father my brother rama to whom you have entrusted me has been sent to the forest now and i am left in a vacuum
where have you gone my king my father forsaking mother kausalya who is without a protector and whose only support rama her son has been sent away to the forest
having seen the circular place looking reddishbrown with burnt bones and ashes where his fathers body was consumed by fire bharata started crying aloud in deep despondency
on seeing the cremation ground desolate bharata collapsed sobbing on the ground like a fastened flag staff of indra which fell as it was being raised
immediately all his counsellors ran towards him like the ascetics who raised yayati a man of pious vows when he fell down at the final hour
beholding bharata satrughna also plunged in grief remembering the king and fell unconscious on the ground
recollecting the many virtues of his father again and again like a madman satrughna mentally unsteady lamented in profound sorrow
with manthara as the source kaikeyi as a crocodile this terrible sea of sorrow which has submerged all of us lies unruffled
where have you gone dear father leaving the lamenting bharata so young and tender who was always your darling
you used to make all of us choose delicious food drinks garments and ornaments who else will do that now
you are a righteous and mighty king and without you this earth would have been broken into pieces but it does not
with my father ascended to heaven and rama gone to the forest where is the strength in me to live i shall enter the blazing fire
devoid of my father and brother i will not return to empty ayodhya that was once ruled by the ikshvakus i will enter the grove of asceticism
having heard the lamentataions of both the brothers and reflecting the calamity befallen on them the attendants felt extremely afflicted once again
thereafter both satrughna and bharata dejected and exhausted lay writhing on the floor like two bulls with their horns broken
then his fathers family priest vasistha of composed mind and versed in the vedas raised bharata and said to him
o lord this is the thirteenth day since the death of your father the heap of bones and ashes still remain on the pyre why this delay on your part
there are three dualities hunger and thirst pain and pleasure birth and death which are applicable to all living beings without any exception and cannot be eschewed therefore it does not behove you to act in this way
the knower of reality sumantra helped satrughna to rise after having consoled him imparted him the truth about the inevitability of birth and death
having risen from the earth both the illustrious tigers among men bharata and satrughna looked faded and weather beaten like the banners of indra that had faded under the sun and rain
the counsellors hastened up both the sons who were wiping away the tears and speaking with blodshot eyes to complete the remaining part of the funeral rites     thus ends the seventyseventh sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
as the griefstricken bharata was intending to proceed to rama lakshmanas younger brother satrughna said to him
couldnt the mighty rama who is the ultimate refuge of all beings protect himself in his own distress that rama has been exiled to the forest by a woman
and why did not lakshmana who is strong and powerful release rama from exile by restraining our father
in the first place the king could have restrained himself by reflecting on whether the course of action adopted by him under the influence of a woman was just or unjust
while satrughna brother of lakshmana was conversing thus the hunchback manthara decorated with all kinds of ornaments arrived at the entrance
she had besmeared herself with the essence of sandal had put on royal garments and adorned herself in many ways with every kind of ornament
tied with colourful girdle strings and wearing many other auspicious ornaments she looked like a female monkey tied with a rope
seeing the hunchback doer of many sinful deeds the gatekeepers caught hold of her and informed satrughna
here is that sinful cruel woman on whose account rama is in the forest and your father has forsaken his body do with her as it pleases you
intensely grieved to hear those words satrughna who was steadfast in his vows said to the inmates of the inner apartment
let this woman who caused deep sorrow to our brothers and father reap the fruit of her malicious actions
saying thus he forcibly caught hold of the hunchback amidst her companions when she filled the house with her cries
perceiving the enraged satrughna all her companions shook in terror and fled in different directions
all her companions conversed among themselves the way he began it looks he will finish all of us
let us seek refuge under the illustrious kausalya who is compassionate generous and knower of righteousness she is our sure saviour
with bloodshot eyes satrughna the scorcher of enemies dragged the shrieking hunchback down the ground in fury
while manthara was being dragged by satrughna the collection of ornaments of many colours and of various kinds worn by her were broken and scattered here and there all over the ground
the resplendent royal palace strewn all over with several ornaments on the ground shone like the autumnal sky studded with innumerable stars
the mighty and the best of men satrughna seized with fury forcibly caught hold of that hunchback and censured kaikeyi with harsh words
kaikeyi deeply distressed at those harsh and grievous words was afraid of satrughna and sought the protection of her son bharata
bharata addressing the enraged satrughna said of all beings a lady is not to be killed pardon her
if righteous rama were not to accuse me of slaying a mother i would have killed the sinful kaikeyi of wicked deeds myself
if righteous rama comes to know that this hunchback has been slain by us he will certainly never talk to you or me
hearing the words of bharata satrughna the younger brother of lakshmana restrained his fury and also released manthara
manthara tormented with grief fell at the feet of kaikeyi and began heaving deep sighs
seeing the hunchback thrown down by satrughna and lying senseless and anguished like a female krauncha bird caught in a net looking in different directions kaikeyi gently soothed her     thus ends the seventyeighth sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
then at the hour of dawn on the fourteenth day all those who were empowered to proclaim the king assembled and addressed bharata
dasaratha who was our most revered master and preceptor having exiled his eldest son rama and mighty lakshmana ascended heaven
o illutrious prince do assume kingship now incidentally there has been yet no attack on this leaderless kingdom
o prince of the raghu race bharata your subjects and guilds of traders artisans etc have procured necessary materials for your consecration and await you
o best among men inherit this stable kingdom of your ancestors get yourself consecrated and save us
bharata firm in vows circumambulated all the articles procured in connection with consecration and replied them as follows
it has been the tradition in our race that the eldest son alone should always inherit the kingdom it does not behove intelligent people like you to tell me like this
our eldest brother rama shall become king as for me i shall dwell in the forest for fourteen years
let the great and powerful army of four divisions be marshalled i will bring back my eldest brother rama from the forest
i shall go to the forest to bring back rama with all these articles procured for coronation kept in front
after coronating rama the best of men there itself i will definitely bring him back letting him go ahead of me like the sacred fire carried from the place of sacrifice
i shall never fulfil the wishes of that woman called my mother i shall dwell in the inaccessible forest and rama shall become king
let the road be aligned by artisans and uneven ground be levelled the guards who judge the inaccessible terrains should follow them on their way
when prince bharata was thus speaking in favour of rama all the people responded with these excellent propitious words
may lakshmi goddess of prosperity abide in you for having expressed your desire to bestow the kingdom upon the kings eldest son
with such graceful words spoken by the prince within their hearing tears of joy filled the eyes of the noble people and fell drop by drop down their faces
all the ministers and members of the council relieved of their distress were delighted to hear these words and said o best among men on your orders devoted people and groups of artisans have been instructed to lay the road      thus ends the seventyninth sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
then surveyors experts in measurment energetic and zealous labourers excavators engineers skilled workers architects craftsmen carpenters roadlevellers woodcutters welldiggers whitewashers basketmakers competent supervisors were sent in advance
like a swollen ocean on a fullmoon day the multitude of people proceeded joyfully with great speed to the appointed place
those groups who were skilled in the construction of roads took up their places with every kind of tool and departed ahead of others
clearing and cutting branches of various trees and creepers shrubs plants branchless trees and hewing boulders the road was paved by the kings men
some of them planted saplings in places where there were none while some others severed trees here and there with axes hatchets and sickles
some other stronger men plucked the strongrooted tufts of fragrant grass here and there they made impassable terrains even
some filled wells and chasms with loose soil while others made low level grounds plain and wide on all sides
people threw bridges at places that needed to be bridged they pulverised stones that obstructed the path and split open big stones to drain out water
in a short time they constructed many water reservoirs of different shapes capable of holding large volumes of water like the sea
in arid places various good drinkingwaterwells surrounded by dykes were dug
the highway for the army was paved smooth with its surface decorated with mosaic it was lined with blossoming trees with flocks of birds intoxicated with singing it was decked with banners and sprinkled with sandal water and a strewn with flowers of every kind like the path of gods the highway shone with brilliance
those authorised ordered the artisans to perform their respective tasks thereafter they selected lovely tracts of land filled with trees bearing varieties of sweet fruits as restingplace for great bharata and decorated them so splendidly that they looked like ornaments themseleves
men wellversed in the study of planetary positions relating to auspicious constellations and auspicious times arranged different restingplaces at different times during the sojourn of great bharata
they heaped sand and dug moats around the restingplace it was adorned with wellbuilt highways and broad thoroughfares lined with mansions surrounded by walls as high as mount indrakeela the peaks of those tall residences decorated with flags which looked as if spreading into the sky thus the restingplace shone like the abode of indra
the reached ganga with its cool and limpid waters abounding in large fishes its bank lined with groves of various trees
the lovely royal road constructed in an orderly fashion by eminent craftsmen looked splendid like the clear sky decorated with by the moon and clusters of stars     thus ends the eightieth sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
thereafter bards and panegyrists adept in conversation with an auspicious start pleased bharata with eulogy in the last part of the night
the drums of the night watch were beaten by golden sticks conches in hundreds were blown and sounds of various modulations were created
the shrill trempets which seemed to fill the heavens caused much more distress to the already griefstricken bharata
then bharata waking up exclaimed i am not the king ordered the pipers to stop and said to satrughna
o satrughna see what great harm has been done to these people at the instance of kaikeyi king dasaratha has gone leaving me to suffer
this kingdom rooted in the righteousness of that noble king is now whirling like a boat in a whirlpool without a helmsman
even rama a great protector for all of us has been banished to the forest by my mother bereft of virtuous conduct
thus lamenting bharata fainted seeing him in this state all the women of the inner apartment at once cried aloud piteously
while bharata was weeping illustrious vasistha conversant with royal traditions entered the assembly hall of the lord of the iksvakus king dasaratha
righteous vasistha along with his disciples reached the lovely golden assembly hall inlaid with gems and precious stones which resembled sudharma the assembly hall of indra
vasistha wellversed in all the vedas sat on a golden seat with a comfortable cover and ordered the messengers
fetch quietly brahmins kshatriyas vaisyas ministers and army commanders at once a matter of great urgency awaits us
bring all the royal attendants satrughna the illustrious bharata yudhajit sumantra and all those wellwishers of the king
as they invitees began arriving on chariots horses and elephants there arose a great tumult
then as bharata apprroached ministers and subjects greeted him as they used to greet dasaratha just as gods greet indra the performer of a hundred sacrifices
the assembly hall looked splendid like a lake of tranquil waters with gems shells pebbles grains of sand and teeming with whales and serpents in the presence of the son of king dasaratha it appeared as though dasaratha himself was present      thus ends the eightyfirst sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
sagacious bharata beheld that assembly hall filled with honourable members like the fullmoon beholds the night stretching forth with stars
when the seats were occupied by the honourable members according to their rank that august assembly looked splendid with the brilliance of their apparels and fragrance of unguents
the most splendid assembly filled with learned people looked brilliant like the night with the autumnal fullmoon
the chief priest vasistha knower of righteousness looked at all the ministers present and addressed bharata in a gentle voice
o dear child following the righteous path king dasaratha conferred on you this vast kingdom abounding in wealth and grains before attaining heaven
abiding in truth remembering the righteous ways of virtuous men just as the rising moon does not leave its beams rama too did not move away from his fathers command
the kingdom free from obstacles has been passed on to you by your father and brother get yourself coronated quickly and enjoy it along with your cheerful ministers
let kings from the north the west the south the bordering kingdoms and the seatraders offer you crores of gems as gifts
on hearing those words bharata who knew his duty was overwhelmed with distress and resolved to abide by righteousness reached rama through his mind thought of rama
young bharata with the melodious voice of a swan choked with tears lamenting in the assembly reproached the family priest vasistha saying
would any man seize this kingdom which rightfully belongs to sagacious rama who practises brahmacharya who is wellversed in all branches of learning and who endeavours to protect righteousness
how can any usurper of the kingdom be born of dasaratha or how would any progeny of dasaratha become the usurper of the kingdom i and the kingdom both belong to rama you should tell the truth about this
the eldest eminent and righteous rama the scion of the kakutstha dynasty who is comparable to dilipa and nahusha deserves to inherit this kingdom just as dasaratha did
if i commit this evil act followed by wretched people which would not lead any one to heaven i shall only be bringing disgrace to the kings of the ikshvaku dynasty
i will never accept the evil deed committed by my mother from here itself i shall pay obeisance with folded palms to my brother who dwells in the impenetrable forest
i shall follow rama the best among men he alone and no one else deserves to rule over the kingdom of the three worlds
hearing the words of bharata full of righteousness all the men assembled there shed tears of joy thinking of rama
if i am not able to bring back my noble brother rama from the forest i shall also dwell there like my noble brother lakshmana
i shall employ all possible means to bring him back and join you who are respectable virtuous and pious
i have already despatched the explorers and protectors of roads who work for wages and without wages as well it also pleases me to undertake this journey
righteous bharata who was full of devotion towards his brother having uttered thus addressed the skilful counsellor sumantra standing nearby
o sumantra quickly rise and go on my authority order the expedition and let the army be marshalled at once
on hearing the words of the magnanimous bharata sumantra was delighted and as instructed ordered everything as if he was anxious to do it himself
having come to know that orders were issued to send the army on an expedition to bring back rama the subjects and the army chiefs were delighted
then the wives of the soldiers having come to know of the expedition were all delighted and in every household hastened up their husbands
those chiefs of the army urged the soldiers horses fastmoving bullockcarts and swift chariots to move on
when bharata saw that the army was ready he instructed sumantra who was standing by the side of the preceptor to quickly prepare his chariot
he sumantra received the command of bharata in great delight and set out with a chariot harnessed with excellent horses
bharata a descendant of the raghu race firm in truth one whose valour comes out of unswerving truth speaking judiciously said this to propitiate his esteemed brother who was in the dense forest
o sumantra arise go at once to the leaders of the army and ask them to assemble the troops i shall propifiate rama who is in the deep forest and bring him back for the welfare of the world
the charioteer categorically commanded by bharata his desire fulfilled communicated the royal mandate to all important subjects chiefs of army and friends
thereafter men from every household kshatriyas vaisyas sudras and brahmins came out and harnessed their chariots to the camels and asses elephants and horses of high pedigree     thus ends the eightysecond sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
getting up at dawn bharata boarded his excellent chariot and set forth swiftly longing to see rama
all the ministers and priests went ahead of bharata mounting their chariots harnessed with horses and resembling the chariot of the sun god
as per tradition nine thousand elephants were arranged to follow bharata delight of the race of the ikshvakus as he set out
sixty thousands chariots and many archers holding weapons of every kind followed the illustrious prince bharata as he went
one hundred thousand horses each mounted by a rider followed bharata one who had conquered his passion and adhered to truth
kaikeyi sumitra as well as the illustrious kausalya travelled by a resplendent chariot delighted with the thought of bringing rama back
venerable people in groups narrating various accomplishments of rama and eager to see him with lakshmana proceeded in a delightful mood
when shall we see that mightyarmed rama of darkblue complexion like the raincloud firm in strength and steadfast in vows and the destroyer of the sorrows of this world
at his sight alone our sorrows will be dispelled the way the darkness of the entire world is dispelled by the rising sun
the inhabitants of the town proceeded joyfully narrating ramas delightful achievements on their way by embracing one another
respectable city folks like traders and other subjects went along in great delight towards rama
gempolishers potters weaponsmiths weavers makers of adornments with peacock feathers sawyers makers of artificial ornaments perforators of shells and ornaments ivoryworkers whitewashers purveyors of fragrant essences renowned goldsmiths blanketcleaners hotbath attendants physicians vintners incense merchants washermen tailors headmen of villages and hamlets actors along with their wives fishermen all followed bharata
brahmins learned in the vedas and renowned for their virtuous conduct followed bharta in their thousands on bullock carts with composed minds
dressed well in clean clothes and anointed with pure red sandalpaste they all slowly followed bharata mounting on various vehicles
the army overwhelmed with joy and cheer followed the devoted brother bharata who had set out to bring back rama
after travelling a long distance on chariots carriages horses and elephants they reached the river ganga close to srngiberapura a country ruled vigilantly by ramas friend the valiant guha who lived there along with his relatives
the army following bharata reached the bank of the river ganga graced by chakravakas ruddy geese and halted there
as he beheld the army following him and the river ganga of sacred waters in front of him bharata who was proficient in speech said to his ministers
you may according to your convenience halt the army anywhere here and after taking rest for the night we shall cross the river ganga tomorrow
meanwhile i shall get into this river and offer libations with water to the departed king for the good of his life in the other world
while he bharatas was speaking this way all the ministers assented by saying be it so and made arrangement for their troops to rest separately according to their pleasure
the army encamped by bharata looked splendid with royal insigaia after making necessary arrangements for the army on the bank of the mighty river ganga and pondering over the means of bringing back the magnanimous rama bharata stayed     thus ends the eightythird sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
guha king of the nishadas observed the bannered army encamped all along the bank of the river ganga hurried off and said to his kinsmen
here is an army as vast as the ocean and i am unable to comprehend its magnitude even mentally
it appears that the evilminded bharata himself has come here the emblem of a huge kovidara pomegranate tree is seen on his chariot
could it be that bharata son of kaikeyi has come here to bind us with the cords or to slay us or is he marching forward with the intention of taking possession of a prosperous rare kingdom by slaying rama who has been banished by his father
rama son of dasaratha is not only my master but also my friend therefore to safeguard his interests remain stationed here on the bank of the river ganga
let all the fishermen who live on meat roots and fruits and protect the river stay here with the troops by taking up positions along the banks of the river ganga
let five hundred boats each manned by a hundred young fishermen fully equipped be in readiness he exhorted them
should it happen that bharata is not illdisposed toward rama the army will safe cross the river ganga today itself
having spoken thus guha lord of the nishadas approached bharata taking with him fish meat and wine as offerings
the valiant sumantra conversant with ways of modesty observed guha approaching them and humbly informed bharata
guha who has come here surrounded by too many thousands of his relations is fully acquainted with the dandaka forest he is an aged man and a friend of your brother said sumatra
o scion of the kakusthas bharata therefore give audience to the overlord of the nishadas guha who undoubtedly knows the whereabouts of rama and lakshmana
on hearing these auspicious words of sumantra bharata said let guha see me at once
having obtaind the permission a delighted guha escorted by his relatives approached bharata and humbly said
this country is like a pleasuregarden at the backyard of your palace all of us are subordinate to you and we solicit you to stay in the house of this servant of yours
here are roots fruits and a great variety of forest produce fresh and dried meat brought by the nishadas
we hope your army having refreshed themselves will spend the night here with our hospitality extended you can proceed tomorrow     thus ends the eightyfourth sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
when thus spoken to bharata a great intellectual replied to guha with these well thought out and meaningful words
o dear friend of my elder brother your desire to extend hospitality to this large army all alone is indeed noble
having spoken to guha courteously the majestic radiant bharata continued
o guha this region of ganga with its dense forest is very difficult to cross how can i reach the hermitage of bharadwaja
when he heard those words of the sagacious bharata guha the forest ranger answered him reverentially with folded palms
o prince of great renown i shall follow you wellprepared with these fishermen armed with bows
are you not going to that place with the evil intention of causing harm to rama of unwearied actions this large army of yours arouses doubts in me
when he heard guha thus speaking bharata who was as tranquil as the sky said to him in a gentle voice
that calmitous time will never come again you should not suspect me i look upon rama my eldest brother as my father
i am going to bring back that scion of the kakutsthas rama who resides in the forest o guha do not entertain any other thought i am tellng you the truth
when he heard those words of bharata guha was delighted and his face beamed with joy as he said to bharata
blessed indeed you are as you desire to renounce the kingdom that has come to you effortlessly i see none equal to you on this earth
you desire to bring back rama who is in great difficulty this everlasting fame of yours will spread all over the world
as guha was thus conversing with bharata the rays of the sun diminished and the night set in
fortunate bharata gratified by guha encamped his army and retired to bed along with satrughna
but the thought of rama caused grief to the magnanimous bharata a man of righteous outlook who did not deserve such grief
just like a concealed forestfire scorching the dried up forest the fire of sorrow kindled in his mind scorched bharata
like the ice melted by the heat of the suns rays flows down the himalayas sweat poured from all parts of his body caused by the fire of grief
bharata son of kaikeyi was stricken by a lofty mountain of grief the cavityless rocks of that mountain were his contemplation the minerals were his sighs the multitude of trees were his desolation peaks were his fatigue and mental distress the unlimited number of animals were his stupor the bamboo tree was his sorrow
then best of men bharata with highly distraught mind and heaving sighs with senses bewildered and oppressed by the fever raging in his heart and caught in a great calamity like a bull separated from the herd enjoyed no peace of mind
bharata a man of great magnanimity joined guha together with his people with composed mind then guha greatly distraught again consoled bharata regarding his elder brother rama     thus ends the eightyfifth sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
then guha the forest ranger described to bharata the countless qualities of the goodnatured magnanimous lakshmana
i spoke to the virtuous lakshmana who was holding arrows bow and sword in his hand and keeping awake completely for the protection of his brother
my friend lakshmana the delight of the raghavas this comfortable couch has been arranged for you lie down peacefully without any anxiety
o righteous one you are used to conforts where as all of our people are accustomed to hardships so we will stay awake and protect rama
to me there is none on earth dearer than rama do not have any anxiety i am telling you the truth
by the grace of rama i want to acquire in this world great renown abundance of righteousness absolute artha prosperity and kama pleasure
as for me bow in hand and all my kinsmen with me i shall protect my dear friend rama who is resting with sita
nothing is unknown to me in this forest in which i range about continually we can withstand an army of four divisions in a battle
the magnanimous lakshmana established in dharma replied
while rama sleep on the ground with sita how can i find sleep or joy or comfort
o guha behold rama whom gods and demons combined cannot withstand in a battle now lying on a bed of grass with sita
rama is the only one among the sons who resembles his father in various virtues dasaratha obtained him after a great deal of austerities and efforts as well
after rama is exiled king dasaratha will not survive for long and surely the earth will soon be widowed
the women of the inner apartment who lamented loudly must have stopped weeping out of weariness by now the clamour in the kings palace would have surely subsided
i doubt whether the king kausalya and my mother sumitra and the rest of them will outlive this night
my mother might live looking at satrughna but kausalya who is the mother of a hero will die from extreme grief
my father king dasaratha failing to fulfil his cherished desires one after another and unable to place rama on the throne will pass away
when the moment of death arrives for my father those who perform the funeral rites for him would have fulfilled their desire
there in the capital of my father with its lovely crossroads and squares welllaid highways full of mansions and palaces encrusted with all kinds of precious stones teeming with elephants horses and chariots resounding with trumpets and with wellbeing everywhere and plenty of pleasuregardens and parks and community festivals people sound in health would be moving about in great comfort
can we ever reenter ayodhya happily after safely fulfilling the vow and completing the term of exile
while the highminded prince was lamenting this way and was waiting the night passed off
the next morning when the sun shone bright both of them matted their hair on the bank of the river bhagirathi ganga and i ferried them across comfortably
rama and lakshmana slayers of enemies who are as strong as bull elephants with their hair matted wearing robes made of bark armed with excellent bows arrows and swords went along with sita looking around vigilantly     thus ends the eightysixth sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
extremely unhappy over what he heard from guha bharata was immersed in thought then and there
the delicate youthful highly energetic and mightyarmed bharata of graceful appearance with shoulders like that of a lion and wideeyed like lotus petals recovered for a moment and with a mind deeply distressed fell down at once like an elephant smitten by a goad
seeing bharata in that state satrughna who was standing close by smitten with grief clasped him cried loudly and fell senseless
then bharatas mothers who were emaciated due to fasting and afflicted by the calamity of the death of their husband were desolate rushed towards him
sobbing they gathered around bharata who had fallen on the ground while kausalya approached him in a depressed state and took him into her arms
desolate kausalya in deep distress clasped bharata out of filial love as if he were her own child wept and enquired of him
o son i hope you are not affected by illness now the existence of this royal house devolves on you
o my son with rama gone to the forest along with your brother lakshmana and with king dasaratha departed from this world i continue to live seeing you from now on you alone are our sole protector
o my son i hope you have not heard any unpleasant news about lakshmana or about my only son rama who has gone to the forest along with his wife
highly renowned bharata composing himself for a moment and still weeping reassured kauslaya and then said this to guha
o guha where did my brother rama sita and lakshmana spend that night what did they eat on what couch did they sleep tell me all that
thereupon delighted guha overlord of the nishadas told bharata all that he had provided to rama his beloved friend and guest
i offered rama rice including a variety of eatables like fruits in great quantity for his food
rama whose prowess is his truth acknowledged all that but remembering the duty enjoined on a kshatriya did not accept them
o king that great rama entreated us in a friendly manner by saying o friend we should always give to others but should never accept anything from others
illustrious rama along with sita only drank the water brought by lakshamana and undertook fasting
thereafter lakshmana also drank the remainder of water then all the three observing silence intently performed the evening worship
therafter the son of sumitra lakshmana himself fetched darbha grass and quickly prepared an auspicious and comfortable bed for rama
rama lay down upon the bed along with sita thereafter lakshmana having washed their feet moved to a distant place
here at the foot of the ingudi tree and upon that bed of grass both rama and sita rested that night
lakshmana the scorcher of enemies wearing protective covering for his palms and fingers made of gohaskin strapping on his back two quivers filled with arrows holding a great bow strung ready stood sentinel throughout the night guarding the surrounding
then holding the best of arrows and bow along with my indefatigable kinsmen similarly armed with bows i stood by the side of lakshmana guarding rama who is comparable to indra     thus ends the eightyseventh sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
after listening to all that guha had said bharatha reached the foot of the ingudi tree accompanied by his ministers and gazing at ramas bed said to all his mothers the magnanimous rama rested that night here on this ground in that crushed bed
rama son of highly fortunate and sagacious dasaratha born of a noble lineage does not deserve to rest on this naked earth
how could rama the best among men used to a bed made of a pile of excellent spreads and overspread with deer skin sleep on the bare ground
rama scorcher of enemies one who was accostomed to dwell in the attic of sevenstoreyed mansions with floors paved with gold and silver spread with excellent carpets decked with bouquets of flowers and perfumed with sandal and agaru the peaks of those palaces were bright like towering white clouds and echoed with cries of parrots they were cool and fragrant with perfumes the marvellous palaces made of golden walls are comparable to mount meru he used to wake up to the sounds of songs and musical instruments the tinkling of finest ornaments and the splendid sounds of the drums many bards genealogists and panegyrists singing befitting ballads and extolling his virtues at appropriate time used to salute him in reverence bharata lamented
it is unbelievable that such a thing has happened to rama in this world it does not seem real to me and looks appears like a dream and my mind is bewildered
dasarathas son rama had to rest on the ground would admittedly mean that no divine power is mightier than time destiny
sita daughter of janaka king of videha and beloved daughterinlaw of dasaratha who caused delight to the beholder too had to rest on the bare ground
this is my brothers couch and it is here where he had tossed about the grass spread on this hard surface is crushed by his limbs
some particles of gold dust are seen stuck to this bed here and there i think sita might have rested on this excellent bed with all her jewellery
that the upper garment of sita might have been caught here is well evident from the shining silken threads stuck
hapless sita is young and delicate being a chaste lady she even in these adverse circumstances does not feel the brunt hence maybe she thinks her husbands hard bed comfortable to her
alas what suffering because of a cruel man like me rama along with his spouse was condemned to recline upon such bed like an orphan
how could such rama sleep on the ground he was born in the house of emperors worthy of reverence by the entire world and beloved of all the worlds with the complexion of a blue lotus with red eyes and pleasing looks one who deserves to be happy and not to suffer by renouncing the kingdom and excellent comforts
surely lakshmana of great merit and auspicious virtues is fortunate since he is accompanying his brother rama in times of adversity
sita has indeed accomplished her object by accompanying her husband to the forest bereft of that magnanimous rama all of us are in doubt if he will accept our services
king dasaratha having ascended to heaven and rama taken shelter in the forest this kingdom appears to me like a ship without a helmsman
no one even in thought would ever desire this kingdom protected by the strength of his arms even while residing in the forest
now the gates of our capital city ayodhya are wide open the city is unprotected and endangered there are no guards to keep vigil over the ramparts the horses and elephants are not in control hence unprepared for battle the army is unhappy and demoralised at this state even the enemies will not like to seize the city they will shun it like food mixed with poison
from today onwards wearing matted hair and clad in robes made of bark and living on fruits and roots i too shall sleep on the naked ground or on grass
taking upon myself the vow of rama i too shall live in the forest cheerfully for the rest of the term on behalf of him so that his vow shall not prove untrue
as i live in the forest on behalf of my brother rama satrughna will live with me my esteemed brother rama will rule ayodhya along with lakshmana
in ayodhya the brahmins shall coronate rama will the gods make this desire of mine true
i will seek his grace in many ways by bowing down my head even then if rama does not grant my wish i shall also live with him as long as it takes he will not be able to ignore a forester like me     thus ends the eightyeigth sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
bharata got up at daybreak after spending the night on the bank of the ganga at that very place where rama the descendent of raghu had stayed and said these words to satrughna
o satrughna blessings to you why are you still alseep arise fetch guha the king of the nishadas quickly he will ferry the army across the river
urged by his brother bharata satrughna replied i am not asleep i am awake i am deeply thinking of our esteemed brother rama
while the two lions among men bharata and satrughna were thus conversing with each other guha came in the appropriate time and said to bharata with folded palms
o scion of the kakutstha race bharata i trust you and your army passed the night on the river bank comfortably without any inconvenience
on hearing guhas affectionate words bharata ever obedient to rama replied
o king guha the night passed comfortably for us we have been honoured by you in many ways let your fishermen be ordered to ferry us across the ganga in their boats
then at bharatas command guha returned to his habitation quickly and said to his relations
arise and awake may you be ever blessed haul down the boats into the river we have to ferry the army across the river
on hearing these words they arose in haste and immediately brought five hundred boats from every direction in accordance with the command of their king guha
they brought excellent boats known as swastika solidly built they lookd magnificent filled with large bells sails and flags
then guha personally brought an auspicious boat known as swastika covered with white canvas and generating captivating sounds
the family priest vasistha and other brahmins were the first to board next mighty bharata and satrughna kausalya sumitra women of the palace including the other wives of the king and wagons and supplies followed
the clamour of the people setting fire to the temporary shelters in that camp descending down the river and transporting the supplies into the boats reached the heaven
those boats adorned with flags were propelled by the fishermen occupying them they sailed with men rowing on board fast
some boats were filled with women some others with horses while still others transported draught animals for drawing carriages and the great treasures
having reached the other bank the men disembarked while returning the fisherfolk exhibited their craft of lovely formations
the elephants embellished with banners and goaded by their mahouts looked splendid like mountains with banners while crossing in the water
only some of the people were able to board the boats some others crossed on rafts and on large pots still others swam with their arms
the auspicious army ferried across the river ganga by the fishermen reached the great forest of prayaga at the auspicious hour of maitra
the noble bharata got his army encamped according to their pleasure and set out accompanied by his priests to see the distinguished sage bharadwaja
bharata the knower of righteous ways and the best among men saw the hermitage of bharadwaja from a distance of one krosa and brought his entire army to a halt he laid aside all his royal robes and weapons clad in silk garments he went on foot along with his ministers with the family priest vasistha ahead of him
then the scion of the raghu race bharata halted his ministers within sight of bharadwajas hermitage and went along following his priest vasistha
on seeing vasistha the great ascetic bharadwaja immediately left his seat and said to his disciples bring offerings of water
after meeting vasistha and greeted by bharata the radiant bharadwaja could recognize he was the son of dasaratha
offering them both in order arghya welcomeoffering water to wash their feet and fruits in accordance with the practice he enquired bharata about the welfare of the family
he enquired about the welfare of ayodhya of the army treasury friends and the ministers but knowingly did not mention about dasarathas wellbeing the knew dasaratha was dead
vasistha and bharata also enquired about his health and welfare of his sacred fires his disciples animals and birds and trees of the hermitage
saying all is well the great ascetic bharadwaja out of his affection for rama said to bharata
why have you come here when you ought to be ruling the kingdom tell me everything about this my mind is not clear in this matter
rama destroyer of enemies and enhancer of the delight of his mother kausalya has been banished to the forest for a long time along with his wife and brother that illustrious one has been ordered by his father to live in the forest for fourteen years through the pursuasion of a woman to enjoy the kingdom without obstacles do you intend to cause any harm to that irreproachable rama and his brother
at these words bharata eyes filled with tears of grief replied to bharadwaja in a stumbling voice
when one so venerable like you too misunderstands me i am gone there is no danger for him from me do not rebuke me this way
i do not approve of whatever my mother said in my absence i am not happy with those words and i do not accept them
i have come to worship the feet of rama the best of men and persuade him to return to ayodhya
o venerable one in consideration of the circumstances i am in be kind to me and tell me the whereabouts of rama lord of the earth
likewise besought by vasistha and other priests the venerable bharadwaja was pleased to tell bharata
o best of men bharata your conduct towards the preceptors your selfrestraint and devotion to the virtuous are all in keeping with those born in the race of raghu
i am aware of the feelings in your heart even then i enquired in order to confirm it and to further your fame
i know your brother who is conversant with righteousness is living on chitrakuta mountain with sita and lakshmana
o supremely sagacious prince gifted with the knowledge of kama desire and artha wealth tomorrow you go but to night stay here with your ministers and fulfil my desire
a man of liberal disposition bharata expressed his intention saying be it so then the prince made up him mind to spend the might in that hermitage      thus ends the ninetieth sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
with the decision of bharata son of kaikeyi to stay there for the night sage bharadwaja extended to him all hospitality
bharata said to bharadwaja you have already extended the hospitality in offering water for washing the feet with and of arghya befitting a guest as available in the forest
bharadwaja then said to bharata with a gentle smile i know you are full of love and content with whatever is offered you
o bharata the best of men i want to treat your army with food this will please me and i hope you will act accordingly
why did you o bharata the best of men station your army at a distance before coming here could you not approach me along with your army
with folded palms in reverence bharata said to sage bharadwaja whose penance was his wealth i did not approach you with the army for fear of you o venerable one
o venerable one a king or a prince ought to intentionally avoid those places occupied by ascetics
o venerable sage spirited horses men and mighty rutting elephants follow me covering a wide expanse of land
lest the army should damage the huts trees land and defile the water in the ashram i came here alone
thus commanded the great ascetic let the army be brought here accordingly bharata ordered the army to come
then bharadwaja entered the fire sanctuary sipped water and washed his hands with water and invoked visvakarma to provide hospitality
i intend to provide hospitality for which i am invoking visvakarma and tvastara who builds houses let adequate arrangements be made
i invoke the three deities guardians of the four quarters headed by indra to extend hospitality to bharata let them make adequate arrangements in this regard
let the rivers flowing towards the east and the west flowing on the earth and in the sky flowing everywhere reach here and now
let some rivers flow with liquor made of datepalms some with wellprepared wine and some with cool water which tastes like sugarcane juice
i invoke the gandharvas visvavasu ha ha and hu hu and also goddesses like gandharvas heavenly musicians and apsaras nymphs from all regions
i summon also grutachi visvachi misrakesi alambusa nagadantha hema and hima whose abode is on the mountain
i invoke all the women who attend on indra and bramha along with tumbur with all their musical instruments
let kuberas divine forest situated in the land of kurus where leaves serve as raiment and ornaments and celestial women as its fruits come here
let the blessed moon furnish me with excellent food of every kind solid liquid soft and those which are to be sucked and licked in great variety and quantity
let her furnish me with manycoloured garlands of fresh flowers from trees wines and other drinks and meat of different kinds
the valiant ascetic of incomparable lustre and power of penance in profound meditation said this in an accent in conformity with vedic instruction
as bharadwaja with folded palms was thus meditating with his face turned eastward all the deities appeared there one by one
meanwhile soft auspicious and pleasant breeze passing over malaya and dardura mountains comforting and cooling the sweat began to blow
then divine clouds rolled in and showered celestial flowers the sounds of heavenly gongs could be heard in every direction
gentle breeze began to blow troops of apsaras danced gandharvas and gods sang and the lyres rang
that soft melodious rhythmic and wellmodulated sound entered the heaven and earth as well as the ears of all living beings
when the celestial sounds pleasing to the ears of men had subsided the army of bharata beheld the wonderful creations of visvakarma
the ground was levelled on every side for five yojanas and covered with several grass lawns resembling lapis lazuli blue sapphire and cats eye
there the best of fruitbearing trees like bilva trees woodapple trees citrons emblic myrobalan trees and mango trees laden with fruits sprang up
from the forests of the northern kuru kingdom with all delights of heaven a divine river with innumerable trees that grow on river banks came into existence
bright quadrangles stables for elephants and horses auspicious arch ways for palaces and mansions sprang up
an auspicious royal palace with splendid archs resembling white clouds sprang up it was sprinkled with celestial perfumes and adorned with beautiful garlands that royal palace forming a quadrangle was furnished with couches seats and carriages and furnished with celestial drinks of every kind delicious food and splendid garments it was stocked with food of every variety in clean and spotless vessels seats for every one and magnificent couches covered with excellent bedstead were arranged
longarmed bharata son of kaikeyi entered that palace full of jewels with the permission of the great sage
all the ministers priests followed him and were glad to see the arrangement in that mansion
there where stood an exquisite throne a fan and a parasol bharata stayed in the company of ministers
he bowed in reverence and worshipped the throne as though rama were seated there taking hold of a fan made of yaks tail he sat in a ministers seat
first the ministers and priests took their respective seats in accordance with their rank and then the army chief and finally the supervisor of the camp
rivers filled with payasam rice cooked in milk and sugar in the shape of mud flowed towards bharata at the command of bharadwaja
on both the banks of those rivers charming celestial houses plastered with white clay appeared by the grace of brahma
at that very moment twenty thousand women adorned with beautiful ornaments sent by brahma presented themselves
twenty thousand women adorned with gold gems and corals sent by kubera came
troops of twenty thousand apsaras by whom any man when taken hold of in their arms could be intoxicated with intense passion came from nandana gardens
there along with narada tumburu and gopa distinguished kings of the gandharvas looking bright like the sun began to sing in the presence of bharata
thereafter the apsaras alambusa misrakesi pundarika and vamana danced near bharata at the command of bharadwaja
the garlands of the gods available in chitrarathas kuberas garden could not match those obtained under the orders of bharadwaja
at the command of bharadwaja bilva trees acted as drummers vibhitaka trees as cymbalists and the pipal trees as dancers
thereafter pine palmyra tilaka and naktamala trees were transformed into hunchbacks and dwarfs and moved about in great delight
asohka emblic myrobalan and all other trees found in the forest malati mallika and jati creepers assumed the form of women came over to the hermitage of bharadwaja and said
o wine drinkers drink as much as you can those who are hungry partake payasam and sacred meat
every single warrior was attended by seven or eight women who applied oil and massaged his body and bathed him on the lovely banks of the river
some women with beautiful eyes quickly approached them for massaging the best of ladies wiped their bodies dry and gave each other wine to drink
the attendants of draughtanimals fed the horses elephants donkeys camels and oxen their appropriate food
the draughtaimals of the illustrious warriors of ikshvaku kings were urged by the highly energetic attendants to eat more and more of parched grain mixed with sugarcane and honey
the horserider no longer recognised the horse or the mahout the elephant and the whole army was inebriated with drinking and pleasure
all the armymen with their desires gratified and anointing their bodies with red sandal paste surrounded by apsaras exclaimed
we will neither return to ayodhya nor enter dandaka forest may bharata and rama be happy
having enjoyed the hospitality of bharadwaja the foot soldiers horse and elephant riders made utterances ignoring their leaders
the exceedingly delighted soldiers of bharatas retinue in their thousands cried out with excitement this is the very heaven
those thousands of soldiers wearing flower garlands ran about dancing singing and laughing
glancing at the ambrosial food a desire arose in the minds of those soldiers to eat once again although they had already partaken it
messengers maidservants female attendants and soldiers all of them in their thousands dressed in fresh garments felt exceedingly proud of themselves
there the elephants donkeys and camels cows and horses and also beasts and birds were wellnourished no one troubled the other
in that army there was none who could be seen without wearing garments of sparkling white who was hungry or dirty or with decayed hair
there the soldiers beheld in amazement thousands of iron containers decked with flags and flowers and filled with white rice mutton pork choicest condiments fruit juice fragrant and tasty soup
along the edge of the forest wells were filled with thick payasam there were wishfulfilling cows and honeydripping trees
the wells were found filled with datepalm liquor and surrounded by pots of well cooked meat of peacocks chicken and other animals
there were thousands of pots lakhs of plates crores of vessels all made of gold and filled with wellgarnished food curd was kept in earthern pots like jugs and jars and pots with a wide mouth tanks were formed some filled with white curd of good flavour and of the colour of woodapple some with white curd blended with spices and some with payasam and heaps of barely powder mixed with sugar
the soldiers saw on the river banks at landing places levigated powder fragrant powder and extracts and other bathing requisites of different kinds stored in receptacles
there the soldiers beheld on every side stacks of toothbrushing sticks white and bristled white lumps of sandal paste placed in dishes made of leaves well cleaned mirrors collection of clothes several pairs of footwear collyrium boxes combs brushes for cleaning moustaches weapons parasoles bows and shining armour different kinds of couches and seats there were pools of drinking water for donkeys camels elephants and horses and excellent landing places filled with flowering lotuses and water lilies the lakes were of transparent waters resembling the hue of the sky easy and comfortable for swimming there they saw heaps of soft grass as green as sapphire and kadamva trees for animals to refresh themselves under
the men were amazed when they beheld the wonderful hospitality extended by maharshi bharadwaja to bharata as if all this happened in a dream world
as they were enjoying themselves in bharadwajas hermitage like the gods in the garden of indra the night wore off
those rivers the gandharvas and all those lovely women took leave of sage bharadwaja and returned to where they had come from
bharata with his retinue received the hospitality and spent the night at bharadwajas ashram then he approached bharadwaja on his own
seeing bharata the best among men who stood with folded palms sage bharadwaja who had just completed his firesacrifice said to him
o sinless one hope you spent the night at our hermitage well tell me whether all your people enjoyed the hospitality
bharata saluted with folded palms the sage of great powers and emerging from the hermitage replied
o holy one i with my ministers and the entire army of men and animals passed the night happily all our desires have been gratified by you
all of us including the messengers were released from fatigue and heat we were wellfed and wellhoused and the night was wellspent
o venerable one o excellent of the ascetics i seek your leave as i am proceeding to see my brother bless me with a kindly look
o knower of righteousness tell me which path leads to the hermitage of that righteous and magnanimous one rama and how far is it from here
thus questioned the great sage brilliant bharadwaja replied to bharata who was yearning to see his brother
o bharata three and a half yojanas from here in the lonely forest stands mount chitrakuta with its charming streams and woodlands
on its northern side flows the river mandakini which is densely covered with flowering trees and lovely blossoming woods on its banks
o dear child beyond that river lies mount chitrakuta on which there is a hut made of leaves where for sure they both dwell
o distinguished lord of the army if you lead your army full of elephants horses and chariots through the southern path or towards the southwest you will come across rama there
when they heard about the journey the wives of dasaratha descended from their chariots worthy of them and stood around the brahmin bharadwaja
among them was kausalya trembling emaciated and desolate along with sumitra they grasped the feet of sage bharadwaja with their hands
kaikeyi with her unfulfilled desire and despised in all the worlds overcome with shame also grasped his feet
she reverently circumambulated that great and divine ascetic and stood not far away from bharata with a sad heart
then bharadwaja firm in his vows said to bharata i want to know about your mothers individually
thus asked by the sagacious bharadwaja bharata proficient in speech replied with palms folded in reverence
o venerable sage this queen you are looking at forlorn and emaciated due to grief and fasting and who resembles a goddess is kausalya the principal queen of my father as aditi bore dhata she bore rama the best among men who walks with the powerful stride of a lion
this lady plunged in grief resembling the branch of a karnikara tree in the midst of the forest with blossoms withered and leaning on the left arm of kausalya is queen sumitra mother of two heroes comparable to gods in beauty and possessing true prowess lakshmana and satrughna
she is my mother kaikeyi who is irascible lacks the power of discrimination proud boastful of her beauty ambitious of wealth ignoble in the guise of a noble woman wicked and intent on sinful acts behold her you may know that because of her rama and lakshmana the best of men entered the forest which may cause their destruction and king dasaratha attained heaven she alone is the root of this great calamity that i am presently confronting
thus spoke bharata the best of men with his eyes reddened and voice choked with sobs and hissing like a king cobra
hearing the words of bharata the great sage wise bharadwaja replied with meaningful words
o bharata you should not find fault with kaikeyi ramas banishment will prove a great source of happiness in future for mankind
banishment of rama will bring about the welfare of the gods the demons and the sages of purified souls
having paid obeisance the accomplished bharata circumambulated sage bharadwaja look leave of him and ordered his army to get ready
different groups of people intending to depart harnessed excellent horsechariots decorated with gold
the male and female elephants wearing golden girths and decorated with pennants set forth with their bells sounding like thunderclouds at the end of summer
various types of costly carriages large and small set forth while the infantry marched on
the women headed by kausalya eager to see rama proceeded delightfully in distinguished carriages
magnanimous bharata got into an auspicious palanquin of the splendour of the sun and the moon kept ready and proceeded amidst escorts
that vast army teeming with elephants horses and chariots proceeded southward spreading like a lofty cloud that had risen in the sky traversing through the forests full of birds and beasts passing through the mountains and streams on the other side of the river ganga
bharatas army of soldiers elephants and horses all in high spirits looked splendid while entering the forest full of frightening flocks of birds and beasts     thus ends the ninetysecond sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
on seeing the great army marching the exited leaders of herds of elephants inhabiting the forest were frightened and ran off with their herds
bears herds of dappled gazelle and antelopes could be seen everywhere in the stretches of the forest also on the mountains and on the river banks
bharata the righteous son of dasaratha proceeded with great delight in the company of the clamouring army of four divisions
the army of the magnanimous bharata resembling the waves of the ocean covered the earth as the clouds cover the sky during the rainy season
at that moment a multiutde of swift horses and elephants spread out with great speed and the surface of the earth became invisible for a long time
with his draught animals extremely wearied by covering a great distance the majestic bharata said to vasistha the best of counsellors
looking at these surroundings and from what i had heard it is clear that we have reached the region indicated by bharadwaja
this mountain is chitrakuta and this river mandakini the forest shines from a distance like a blue cloud
the enchanting ridges of mount chitrakuta are now trampled by my mountainlike elephants
the trees on the mountain ridges are shedding flowers like dense blue rainclouds showering water at the end of summer
o satrughna behold this mountain frequented by kinneras and abounding in animals like great crocodiles in the ocean
incited by the clamour of the army these swiftrunning herds of deer expelled from their retreats resemble mass of clouds in the autumnal sky shattered by the wind
like the people of the south the trees on the mountain ridges with branches brilliant like clouds are crowned with fragrant flowers as adornments
this forest dreadful in appearance was devoid of twittering of birds but now it appears to me like ayodhya thronged with people
while the dust kicked by the hooves of the horses enveloped the forest the wind as if to please me is quickly blowing them away
behold o satrughna these chariots commanded by excellent charioteers harnessed with horses are flying through the forest
behold these lovely frightened peacocks and other birds hurriedly entering their nests
being the abode of ascetics this region looks very charming like the pathway to heaven
in this forest many a dappled deer with their mates looking as if painted with flowers are seen wandering about with a charming appearance
let the soldiers set out and properly search the forest till such time the best of men rama and lakshmana are found
hearing the words of bharata those valiant warriors with weapons in their hands entered the forest therafter they observed a spiral of smoke rising
having seen the column of smoke they returned and informed bharata saying in a place bereft of men fire cannot exist clearly rama and lakshmana must be here only
in case the two princes rama and lakshmana the best of men and subduers of enemies are not residing here then evidently it must be some other ascetics like rama
having heard these words acceptable to the pious bharata the crusher of enemy forces addressed the entire army
all of you carefully watch here do not proceed any further sumantra the preceptor and myself shall go forward
at this command all of them halted then bharata fixed his gaze on the source of the smoke
the army thus halted by bharata gazing at the space before them rejoiced at the thought that not long before they would rejoin their beloved rama     thus ends the ninetythird sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
rama resembling the gods who had been living there for long developed a liking for the mountains and forests with a desire to please sita and his own mind he showed her the wonderful chitrakuta mountain as indra did to his wife sachi
o gentle one when i behold this lovely mountain neither the expulsion from the kingdom nor being away from friends pains my mind
o auspicious one you may behold this mountin abounding in flocks of birds of every kind and its peaks adorned wtih minerals and as if piercing the sky
this mountain with its peaks is adorned with various minerals some of the regions have the radiance of silver and bronze some look bloodred or maddercrimson some sparkle like the rarest of gems while others shine like topaz or crystal or a flower of ketaka plant or shimmer like stars and quicksilver
this mount chitrakuta is swarmed by flocks of birds and herds of several kinds of animals like tigers panthers and bears of every kind giving up their cruel nature
this mountain is spread over with various kinds of flowering trees and trees laden with fruits shady and enchanting mango roseapples asanas lodhras priyalas jackfruit trees dhavas ankolas lovely tinisas bilva trees tinduka and bamboo kashmaya arishta and varuna madhukas tilaka trees badari and myrobalan trees nipa trees cane danvas and promegranate trees the mountain looks splendid
o auspiciouslooking one behold these highspirited kinneras in pairs who are sporting on the picturesque hill plateaus causing thrills
behold the captivating sporting retreats of vidyadharis with their swords and best garments hung on the branches of the trees
behold a waterfall here and a fountain there gushing from the earth and in other places the mountain looks like an elephant rutting ichor
the breeze from the caves carrying the fragrance of many flowers is satisfying the sense of smell who will not find it delightful
o flawless one if i am to live here for many years to come with you and lakshmana no grief will consume me
o lovely sita i am enamoured of this delightful mountain with its enchanting peaks laden with abundance of flowers and fruits and flocked by different kinds of birds
by living in the forest i have achieved a twofold benefitdischarge of debt of my father with regard to righteousness and causing happiness to bharata
o sita are you enjoying by being with me here on this chitrakuta and observing various objects gratifying to the body mind and speech
my greatgrandfathers and ancient royal sages used to say that living in the forest is like enjoying nectar for a king for the best existence after death
several hundreds of massive rocks of the mountain look splendid all around in blueblack yellow white and red colours
herbs in thousands on this king of the hills shine in the night with the splendour of their own lustre like flames of fire
o lovely sita some regions of the mountain look like dwellingplaces some others are like flowergardens and some are shining like a single rock
this chitrakuta mountain stands erect as if it has arisen by splitting open the earth and its peak looks graceful from every side
behold those excellent couches of lovers spread with leaves of kustha sthagara punnaga and bhurja and covered with lotus petals
o lady behold those lotus garlands crushed and cast aside by lovers and also many fruits tasted by them and lying there
this chitrakuta mountain with abundance of roots fruits and water surpasses in beauty vasvaukasara the capital city of kubera or nalini his celestial garden or the land of uttarakuru
o my beloved sita by spending time with you and lakshmana following the path of the virtuous with utmost restraint and by enhancing the righteousness of my race i shall obtain great felicity     thus ends the ninetyfourth sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
then rama the lord of kosala descended from the mountain and showed sita the charming river mandakini of sacred waters
lotuseyed rama said to the heavyhipped daughter of the king of videha whose face resembled the beauitiful moon
look at this enchanting river mandakini with its variegated sandbanks frequented by geese and swans and adorned with lotuses
see this river sparkling with trees of every kind laden with fruits and flowers growing on its banks everywhere it resembles the lake nalini of kubera
the herds of deer have just drunk water by descending down the landing places and the waters are still turbid this sight produces great pleasure in me
o my beloved rishis with matted locks and wearing deer skins and bark of trees as upper cloth bathe in the river mandakini for performing morning ablutions in time
o largeeyed sita some other ascetics of rigid austerities worship the sungod according to tradition lifting up their arms and invoking the sun
with the trees whose tops are swayed by the wind the mountain was as if dancing shedding leaves and flowers all around the river
behold this river mandakini whose waters here are transparent like crystals there sparkling with sand dunes and elsewhere crowded with siddhas
look at the scattered heaps of flowers shaken off by the wind and large quantities of flowers floating on the waters
o my auspicious sita sweetvoiced chakravaka birds singing in most pleasant tones are alighting on those heaps of flowers
my lovely sita i consider watching this mount chitrakuta and river mandakini in your presence more delightful than living in ayodhya
the waters of river mandakini is perpetually agitated by siddhas who are endowed with asceticism selfrestraint and tranquillity and who are cleansed of sins by taking bath in the river plunge with me into this river
o lovely sita like a companion plunge into this river mandakini submerging the red and white lotuses and enjoy sporting
o my lovely lady always think this river mandakini as sarayu and this mount chitrakuta as ayodhya and these wild animals as its inhabitants
with righteous lakshmana obedient and you o sita agreeable to me you both bring me great pleasure
bathing thrice in your company at the time of prayers and partaking honey roots and fruits i do not yearn either for ayodhya or for the kingdom
with this enchanting mandakini teeming with herds of deer whose waters are drunk by elephants lions and monkeys decorated with heaps of flowers fallen from the trees in full bloom who will not feel happy and free from fatigue
rama the perpetuator of the raghu dynasty describing the river mandakini at length appropriately in this manner wandered in the company of his beloved consort on mount chitrakuta looking black like collyrium     thus ends the ninetyfifth sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
rama showed sita the princess of mithila the river mandakini flowing in the mountain gratified her by offering meat to eat and sat on the mountain slope
offering sita several kinds of preparations to eat righteous rama seated in her company remarked this meat is savoury this meat roasted on fire is sacred
now as rama was sitting there the tumult and the dust raised by the approaching army of bharata reached the sky
meanwhile the mighty leaders of the elephantherds were agitated and frightened by the loud noise fled away from there in different directions
rama heard the sound generated by the army and saw those leaders of herds fleeing away
seeing those animals fleeing and hearing the clamour rama addressed lakshmana son of sumitra who was blazing with energy
o lakshmana the worthy son of sumitra fearful and tumultuous clamour like rumbling sound of clouds is heard what a wonder go and see
herds of elephants and buffaloes in the great woods and wild beasts frightened by lions are running in different directions
o lakshmana do ascertain if any king or prince has come for hunting or whether any ferocious animal has entered this forest shouldnt you
o lakshmana this mountain is highly inaccessible even to birds find out exactly and quickly what this is all about
lakshmana hurriedly climbed a flowering sala tree surveyed in all directions and fixed his gaze on the east
turning his face to the north he beheld a vast army consisting of chariots elephants and horses and a wellequipped infantry
he lakshmana informed rama about the army full of horses and elephants and decorated with chariotbanners and said these words
o noble one put out the sacred fire agnihotra and let sita take refuge in the cave string your bow and keep the arrows ready put on your armour
rama the best among men replied to lakshamana oh lakshmana look properly and tell me to whom do you think this army might belong
hearing the words of rama enraged lakshmana like a flaming fire as if he would reduce the army to ashes replied
it is evident that kaikeyis son bharata who has been consecrated is coming to slay both of us desiring the prosperous kingdom to be without obstacles
there on that chariot is a banner shining brilliantly with the emblem of a lofty majestic kovidara tree with a large trunk
there the emblem of the great kovidara tree of very large trunk spread with many branches shines brilliantly atop the chariot
these men mounted on swiftlymoving horses are following the post the riders of elephants mounted on the elephants look cheerful
o mighty warrior let both of us take up the bows and station ourselves on this mountain or we shall stay here itself armed with weapons fully prepared for the battle
o rama will this kovidara emblem come into our possession in the battle can i see bharata the cause of the calamity that has befallen you sita and me
o that mighty warrior bharata on whose account you have been banished from the perpetual kingdom comes here as a foe and as for me he deserves to be slain
o rama i do not see anything wrong in slaying bharata in killing one who had done harm is not an act of unrighteousness
o rama bharata has abandoned righteousness and has harmed you when he is slain you shall rule over the whole earth
let that kaikeyi greedy for the kingdom see in great anguish her son who shall be slain by me today in a battle like a tree felled by an elephant
i shall also slay kaikeyi with her attendants and relations let the earth be cleansed of the great sin today
o protector of honour today i shall vent my suppressed anger and dishonour on the enemys army like a fire on the thicket
today i shall rend the bodies of enemies with my sharpened arrows and spatter the forest of chitrakuta mountain with their blood
let the wild beasts drag away the elephants horses and men to be killed by me with their hearts transfixed with my arrows
having slain bharata and his army in this great forest i shall doubtless discharge my debt to my arrows and bow      thus ends the ninetysixth sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
thereafter rama pacified lakshmana son of sumitra who was violently agitated he said to him who had swooned with rage
when sagacious bharata of great strength has come here where is the need for a bow or a sword or a shield
o lakshmana having sworn that i would make fathers word true what shall i do with the kingdom earned slanderously by slaying bharata who has come to see me
i shall never accept any wealth obtained by destroying kith and kin or friends which is akin to taking food prepared with poison
o lakshmana on the oath of righteousness i wish wealth and pleasure as well as this kingdom for the sake of you all
o lakshmana i desire this kingdom only for the unity and happiness of my brothers i swear on the weapon i hold
o gentle lakshmana lordship of this earth with the sea as its garment is not difficult to obtain for me but i do not desire even indrahood by unrighteous means
o protector of honour even if there were to be some happiness which i could enjoy without you bharata and satrughna let it be reduced to ashes by fire
o best among men o valiant one i think bharata who is affectionate towards his brothers and who is dearer to me than my life must have returned to ayodhya and has heard that i had been exiled along with you and janaki wearing barks and matted locks remembering the duties of the race with an afflicted mind and with agitated senses he has come here to see me he has not come with any other intention
auspicious bharata angry with kaikeyi and having spoken to her unpleasant bitter words and having propitiated our father has come here to offer me the kingdom
finding the time appropriate bharata has come to see us even in his mind he would have never thought of causing any harm to us in any way
why are you suspicious of bharata has he done anything disagreeable to you any time in the past
you must not speak any harsh or unpleasant words against bharata if you do they will be deemed to be directed against me
whatever be the calamity o lakshmana how will sons slay their father or a brother kill his own brother who is as dear to him as his own life
if you are saying all these words only for the sake of the kingdom then i shall ask bharata when i see him to offer this kingdom to you
o lakshmana if i earnestly exhort bharata to offer this kingdom to you then on hearing those words he would say certainly so
having heard the words uttered by his brother rama of virtuous disposition lakshmana who was devoted to his brothers welfare shrank
hearing the words of rama lakshmana was abashed and said i think it is our father king dasaratha who has come here personally to see you
observing lakshmanas abashment rama said i think the mightyarmed king dasaratha has come to see all of us here
or rather having thought of the adversities of dwelling in a forest and also by realising that both of us are accustomed to comforts i think he has certainly come to take us back home
our father the prosperous dasaratha after withdrawing this princess vaidehi who is brought up in luxury from the forest to ayodhya will return
o valiant warrior you can see those two splendid horses of high pedigree charming swift and equal to wind in speed are shining in the army
there is that huge and aged elephant named satrunjaya which belogns to our sagacious father proceeding at the head of the army
i do not see o longarmed one that splendid white canopy of my father wellrespected by men and this gives rise to doubts in my mind
get off the treetop o lakshmana and do what i say said the righteous rama
lakshmana the conqueror of foes descended from the top of the sala tree and stood by the side of rama with folded palms
let not the hermitage be crowded commanded bharata and the army encamped around the mountain
bharatas army full of horses elephants and chariots covering a distance of more than one and a half yojanas encamped by the side of the mountain
the army brought by bharata the great moralist was shining around chitrakuta mountain following dharma and casting off all pride in order to please rama     thus ends the ninetyseventh sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
on encamping the army lord bharata the best among men wished to approach on foot rama who was devoted to his father
after the army encamped in the assigned places bharata said to his brother satrughna thus
o dear satrughna you should explore this forest quickly along with groups of our people and hunters as well
let guha surrounded by a thousand kinsmen and armed with bows arrows and swords look for rama
i myself shall go on foot surrounded by ministers citizens preceptors and brahmins and search the entire forest
i shall not rest in peace until i see rama powerful lakshmana and illustrious princess of videha sita
i shall not attain peace until i see my brother rama whose auspicious countenance looks radiant as the moon and whose eyes as lotuspetals
peace shall not come to me until i hold on my head the feet of my brother the insignia of royalty
i shall not attain peace until rama who is worthy of this kingdom is sprinkled with the holy water of coronation and assumes the ancestral kingdom
lakshmana one who beholds the highly effulgent countenance of rama resembling the spotless moon and whose eyes resemble red lotuses is blessed indeed
sita the illustrious daughter of janaka and princess of videha has accomplished her purpose by following rama the lord of this earth bounded by the ocean
like kubera in the nandana garden rama lives here on mount chitrakuta which is indeed blessed like the himalaya king of the mountains
fortunate is this inaccessible forest which is inhabited by wild animals to have become the dwelling place of the most radiant rama the foremost among the wielders of weapons
having said thus the best of men mightyarmed and highly energetic bharata entered the great forest on foot
bharata the best among the eloquent made his way amidst multitude of trees grown on mountain slopes with their tops in full bloom
having reached a flowering sala tree atop chitrakuta mountain he beheld a lofty banner of smoke rising from the fire burning in ramas hermitage
on seeing the smoke majestic bharata in the company of relatives concluded that rama was staying there and rejoiced like a man who had reached the other bank of the river
having heard of ramas hermitage on the chitrakuta mountain inhabited by pious men magnanimous bharata commanded his army to stay at a distance and quickly proceeded with guha     thus ends the ninetyeighth sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
eager to see his brother bharata encamped the army and set out showing the hermitage to satrughna
bharata deeply devoted towards elders indicated to sage vasistha to bring along the mothers and proceeded ahead quickly
sumantra who was overeager like bharata to see rama followed satrughna who was not far from him
while walking bharata beheld a hut made of leaves looking like a hermits cottage
in front of that hut bharata beheld shattered logs of wood and also flowers plucked
bharata beheld here and there knots of kusa grass and strips of bark tied on trees as signs to ascertain the way to the hermitage of rama and lakshmana
he also beheld large heaps of dried cakes of dung of buffaloes and deer for use against cold in the forest
walking on the longarmed effulgent and delighted bharata said to satrughna and the ministers surrounding him
we must have reached the region about which bharadwaja had spoken i think river mandakini is not far from here
here are long bark garments fastened on lofty places as marks of identification left by lakshmana to locate the path at odd times which may be needed while going out
this must be the place on the hillside on which mighty tuskers wander about trumpeting and charging at one another
here is the thick smoke emanating from the blacktrailed fire maintained perpetually by the ascetics living in the forest
i shall see here with a delighted heart the venerable rama the best of men who renders great hospitality to elders and who resembles a maharshi
bharata walked for a short distance towards mount chitrkuta when he reached river mandakini and then said to his ministers
rama the lord of men a tiger among men is sitting on the ground in a heroic yogic posture in this secluded forest o fie upon my birth and my life
effulgent rama the lord of the world had to renounce all desires and undergo this calamity of living in the forest on my account
reviled by the world i shall now fall at the feet of sita rama and lakshmana seeking their grace
lamenting in this way bharata beheld in that forest an excellent sacred and enchanting hut covered with a lot of leaves of sala palmyra and aswakarna trees like a sacrificial altar spread with soft kusa grass goldplated bows that resembled the thunderbolt of indra powerful and capable of achieving great targets and oppressing the enemies adorned the hut arrows glittering like the rays of the sun were dreadful with blazing heads and stored in quivers adorned it like the hooded serpents illumining the city of bhogavati in the nether world a pair of swords in scabbards made of excellent silver two shields of different colours with golden spots fingerguards made of skin of iguana decorated with gold were hanging there it was impregnable to enemy hordes like the cave of a lion to the deer
bharata beheld at ramas residence a sacred and spacious altar sloping to the northeast with a burning fire upon it
bharata looked around for a moment and saw his esteemed brother rama seated in that thatched cottage wearing matted locks of hair
he saw rama lord of the oceanbound earth seated like blazing fire clad in antelope skin and garment of bark with long arms and shoulders like a lion and eyes like white lotuses the mightyarmed warrior seemed like brahma the creator and the eternal protector of righteousness accompanied by sita and lakshmana rama sat on the bare ground strewn with darbha grass
beholding rama bharata the majestic and righteous son of kaikeyi overwhelmed with grief and distress rushed towards him
on seeing rama bharata could not control his grief with patience and lamented in great anguish and with words choked with tears said
my elder brother who deserves to be attended by ministers and other subjects in the royal assembly sits here today in the forest surrounded by wild beasts
such magnanimous rama a follower of dharma accustomed to be attired in thousands of dresses in the past now clad in two deer skins is practising righteousness
how is it that rama who used to wear variegated flowers formerly now bears these heavy matted locks
that rama who in accordance with tradition deserves accredition of religious merit through sacrifices now seeks it through mortification of body
how is it that the body of my venerable brother which was once smeared with expensive fragrant sandal paste is now covered with dust
it is on my account that rama who was accustomed to all comforts has fallen into this misfortune fie on my life of cruelty which is condemned by the world
thus bharata lamented in misery and with his lotuslike countenanace sweating before reaching ramas feet fell down crying in distress
mighty prince bharata oppressed with grief could only say o arya venerable one and in distress could not speak any more
as he beheld the glorious rama with his throat choken with tears he cried out o arya venerable one and thereafter was unable to speak any more
satrughna also prostrated himself at the feet of tearful rama who embraced both of them
thereafter princes rama and lakshmana joined sumantra and guha in the forest like the sun and the moon meeting the planets sukra and brihaspati in the sky
on seeing the princes now assembled in the great forest like mighty leaders of elephant herds inhabitants of the forest had nothing but tears of grief not joy to shed     thus ends the ninetyninth sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
rama beheld bharata with matted locks and robes of bark fallen down on the ground with folded hands like the sun at the time of dissolution of the world it was really difficult to look at him
rama found it extremely difficult to recognise bharata with his emaciated body and pallid face he held him in his arms and lifted him
born in the race of raghu rama embraced bharata and kissed him on his forehead placing him on his lap he enquired thus with a composed mind
o dear now that you have come to the forest where is our father king dasaratha you ought not come to the forest while he is living
you have come a long distance from ayodhya to this forest o bharata it is a pity dear brother to see you after a long time so emaciated what brings you to the forest
my dear brother now that you have come here i trust king dasaratha is keeping good health and hope he has not departed prematurely in despondency for the other world
o gentle one being young and inexperienced i trust you have not forfeited the kingdom for ever dear child i trust you are looking after father whose prowess is his truthfulness

o bharata the wellguarded advice of ministers learned in scriptures and capable of proper counselling is the root of victory for kings specially when the advice is kept in confidence

dear brother i hope others are not able to understand your determination or those of your ministers either by conjecture or by inference or through other means without being revealed either by you or by your ministers
i hope by setting aside a thousand fools you prefer a single wise man a wise man will be of immense help in difficult situations

a single clearsighted minister who is prudent brave and skilful can bring about great prosperity to a king or a prince
i hope you have employed highly competent servants for important tasks mediocre servants in mediocre tasks and low people in inferior tasks
i hope you are assigning ministers who are unyielding to bribery and other temptations holding positions hereditarily and who are full of integrity and eminence with superior tasks
are not the citizens of your kingdom agitated at severe punishment meted out to them reproaching your ministers
just like a performer of sacrifice scorns at an outcaste or a woman scorns at a lustful lover do the subjects not scorn you for collecting taxes more than what is due
a learned person but skilled in contrivances a warrior with passion for wealth and a man ever engaged in corrupting the minds of servants must be slain a king who does not kill them is himself killed in due course

i hope all men of a good family especially those who belong to our race are loyal to you and are ready to sacrifice their lives for your cause
o bharata i hope you have chosen as your envoy an expert born in your own country wellinformed skilful and quick to understand one who repeats and reports exactly what has been told
i hope you collect information of their secret efforts intelligently through unrecognisable spies with three of them closely watching each of the eighteen officials there are eighteen categories of officials in a kingdom of the enemys side and fifteen officials on your side
o slayer of foes i hope you are always alert about your foes who were defeated by you and have come back you should not ignore your enemies thinking they are weak
dear brother i hope you do not serve those brahmins who are atheists who foolishly think of this world alone and fancy themselves as learned they only bring disasters
while principal scriptures do exist these superficial fellows take resort to the science of logic based on abstract reasoning and indulge in futile talks
my dear brother i trust you are protecting the impregnable city of ayodhya worthy of its name formerly defended by our heroic ancestors with its sturdy gates its elephants horses and chariots its thousands of venerable selfcontrolled and highly energetic brahmins kshatriyas and vaisyas engaged in their respective professions filled with palaces of various kinds abounding in learned people and a prosperous city where everything is available in abundance

o bharata i trust that your ministers are wellinformed and look into all matters in times of hardship pertaining to whether a man is rich or poor without any bias to either

o highly sagacious bharata those brahmins who can comprehend the meaning of all scriptures along with the inhabitants of the city and country i trust are seeking your happiness
i trust you eschew the fourteen faults of kings like atheism falsehood anger inattention procrastination evading the wise indolence gratification of all five senses planning alone in the affairs of the kingdom consultation with people who are proficient in worthless acts failure to implement decisious inability to keep the counsel secret and omission of auspicious practices and setting out against all the enemies at a time
o highly sagacious bharata i trust having understood their true nature you are appropriately following the ten five and four divisions the seven divisions the eight divisions the three divisions three kinds of knowledge victory over the senses the six qualities evils arising from destiny and human agency kritya division of twenty similarly prakriti and mandalas and two sources of yatra and chastisement and of peace and war

the highly sagacious and learned king having acquired the entire earth and punishing the people in accordance with tradition and righteously ruling the kingdom will ascend the his release from this world     thus ends the hundredth sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
on listening to rama bharata replied of what use shall be these royal duties to me when i have fallen from righteousness
o best of men there is an ancient tradition in our race that the younger son cannot become king when the eldest is there
therefore o scion of the raghu race return along with me to prosperous ayodhya and for the good of our race get your self coronated
other think the king to be a human but to me he is divine since his conduct and the statecraft are superhuman as they are in conformity with righteousness
while i was in kekaya and you took refuge in the forest venerable king dasaratha who was always engaged in sacrifices and was held in high esteem by the virtuous ascended to heaven
as soon as you set out for the forest along with sita and lakshmana the king overwhelmed with grief attained heaven
arise o best of men and offer libations to our father i and satrughna have already done so
o son of raghus race it is said that whatever is offered by a dear son becomes eternal in the world of manes you alone are the beloved son of our father
your father deprived of you brooding over you wishing to behold you unable to divert his mind fixed on you remembering you alone and immersed in sorrow departed from this world        thus ends the hundredone sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
having heard the words of bharata regarding the death of his father rama became unconscious
on hearing the thunderlike words spoken by bharata afflicting the mind like the thunderbolt hurled by indra enemy of demons in a battle rama the scorcher of enemies stretching forth both his arms fell down on the ground like a tree with flowering tops severed by an axe in the forest
those brothers on all sides with sita lamenting sprinkled water on rama the great archer and lord of the earth who afflicted with grief had fallen down on the ground and was lying like an elephant exhausted from repeatedly striking a river bank
on regaining consciousness shedding tears profusely rama again started speaking piteously
on hearing that his father king dasaratha the lord of the world had attained heaven righteous rama said to bharata in conformty with his rightful conduct
what shall i do in ayodhya now that my father has followed the path ordained by the gods who will rule that ayodhya deprived of that best of kings
i could not even perform the last rites of that magnanimous one who died of grief on account of me what use is my life with an unlucky birth
o irreproachable bharata it is gratifying that you and satrughna are indeed fortunate to have fulfilled your cherished desire since the king was wellhonoured by you with all the obsequial rites
even after the completion of my exile i do not wish to return to ayodhya which is directionless bereft of its chief the king
o subduer of enemies when father has gone to the other world who will guide me in ayodhya after i complete my term of exile
on seeing my good conduct our father used to say comforting words to me now from whom can i hear such words pleasing to the ears
having thus spoken to bharata rama overwhelmed with grief approached his wife sita whose face looked like the full moon and said to her
o sita your fatherinlaw is dead o lakshmana you are deprived of your father bharata is relating to me the sad news that king dasaratha has attained his heavenly abode
while the scion of the kakutsthas was saying thus copious tears welled up from the eyes of all those illustrious sons of dasaratha
all the brothers having consoled rama as best they could told him let the libations be offered to our father the protector of the world
on hearing that her fatherinlaw king dasaratha had attained heaven sita her eyes filled with tears could not look at her husband in the face
having consoled sita daughter of janaka griefstricken rama said to lakshmana who was also distressed with grief
i shall go and offer libations to my magnanimous father go and fetch the dried pulp of ingudi fruit and an upper garment made of bark
let us proceed in this order you first sita second and i last this procession in mourning is terrible indeed
thereafter their constant follower sumantra who was conversant in spiritual knowledge a highminded person softnatured selfcontrolled tranquilminded and staunchly devoted to rama consoled him holding the hands of the princes sumantra helped their descent into the auspicious river mandakini for taking bath
the illustrious brothers approached with great difficulty the swiftflowing and enchanting river mandakini which had convenient descent and endowed with forests always in bloom they descended at an auspicious place that was not slushy and offered libations of water saying o father let these offerings be yours
rama the ruler of the earth held water with both palms cupped and facing the south the direction of yama the god of death said these words sobbing
o best of kings you are gone to the world of the manes and let this inexhaustible libation of pure water reach you
then the powerful scion of the raghu race reached bank from the bathing spot of the river mandakini along with his brothers and offered pinda an offering of rice flour to the departed to his late lamented father
placing the balls of ingudi pulp mixed with badari fruit on a spread of darbha grass rama was overcome with grief and weeping said
o great king we offer you such food as we partake now be pleased to accept it for his gods are offered the food a man takes
rama the tiger among men ascending the riverbank and proceeding on the same path he had come climbed the chitrakuta mountain of charming slopes
rama lord of the earth reached the door of the leafhut and took bharata and lakshmana in his arms
the mountain echoed with the sound of lamentations of all the brothers along with sita which resembled the roar of lions
the soldiers of bharata were alarmed on hearing the tumultuous sounds raised by those mighty brothers offering libations of water and lamenting
they said bharata must have joined rama that loud noise must be their wailing over their deceased father
then all of them left their camps with one single thought of seeing rama in their minds and ran in the direction from where that sound emanated
some rode horses some elephants while others mounted welldecorated chariots while the young went on foot
the whole multitude of people at once rushed towards the hermitage wishing to see rama as if he had left long ago though he had gone on exile very recently
eager to see the union of brothers all those people went by every sort of vehicle filled with the sounds of hooves and wheels
the earth crushed by several vehicles hooves of horses and wheels of chariots emitted tumultuous sounds like the sky in the gathering stormclouds
frightened by the sound the elephants followed by their females spreading all the way the odour of the ichor moved to other forests
hearing that sound hosts of boars and deer buffaloes serpents and apes tigers antelopes with ears like the cows gavayas as well as dappled antelopes were all frightened
ducks watercranes geese karandavas cranes male cuckoos and kraunchas fled senselessly in different directions
the sky was filled with birds frightened by the sound and the earth covered with people both looked extremely beautiful
all at once the people saw the illustrious rama the best of men and the subduer of enemies squatting on the bare earth
all those men with faces full of tears reproaching kaikeyi and manthara all the way approached rama
thereafter beholding those people deeply afflicted their eyes full of tears rama embraced them as if they were his own father and mother
rama embraced some while others paid him obeisance therafter he honoured his erstwhile companions and relations in accordance with their status
the weeping and the tumult of those magnanimous people made the earth sky mountaincaves and all quarters reverberate incessantly like the beating of drums     thus ends the hundred and second sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
longing to see rama vasistha headed by the wives of dasaratha set out on foot where rama was offering libations
the wives of the king while proceeding slowly towards the river mandakini beheld the bathing place frequented by rama and lakshmana
kausalya with eyes filled with tears and her face emaciated addressing sumitra and the other wives of the king sadly said
this is a sacred place to the east of the forest used by the unfortunate rama and lakshmana of untiring energy and sita expelled from the country and undergoing suffering
o sumitra your son lakshmana free from laziness always carries water from here for the sake of my son
your son though engaged in servile tasks like bringing water is not to be held contemptible because all the services intended for the benefit of his brother are prompted by virtue
this your son unaccustomed to and undeserving of any suffering may now give up this mean and distressing duty entrusted to him
that largeeyed kausalya beheld the cakes of ingudi pulp placed by rama for his father on a spread of darbha grass whose blades pointed toward the south
seeing the pinda edible offering made to the departed soul placed on the ground for his father by the distressed rama queen kausalya addressing all the wives of dasaratha said
have darsan of this pinda offered by rama according to tradition to his magnanimous father dasaratha lord of the ikshvaku race
i do not think that this is an appropriate food for that godlike and great lord of the earth who enjoyed all luxury
how can indralike dasaratha having ruled the earth bounded by four oceans eat a cake of ingudi pulp
rama who was once highly prosperous had to offer the cake of ingudi pulp to his father nothing appears more painful to me than this in this world
seeing the offering of cake of ingudi pulp by rama to his father how is it that my heart does not break into a thousand pieces in sorrow
the wellknown saying in this world is that whatever food a man partakes his gods also partake the same this dictum appears true now
the cowives having thus consoled the distressed kausalya went to the hermitage there they beheld rama who looked like a god dislodged from heaven
beholding rama devoid of all luxury his mothers afflicted with grief and overcome with sorrow cried aloud tears streaming down
rama the best among men and true to his promise rose and touched the auspicious feet of all his mothers in reverence
those largeeyed queens their palms with delicate fingers and with auspicious hands with a pleasant touch wiped the dust from the back of his body
on seeing his mothers lakshmana too was overcome with grief and with devotion followed rama and slowly bowed to them with reverence
all the queens treated lakshmana born of dasaratha and endowed with auspicious qualities with the same love as they did to rama
sita too overcome with grief grasped the feet of her mothersinlaw and stood before them her eyes full of tears
like a mother to her daughter kausalya embraced the wretched sita who was afflicted with sorrow and emaciated due to her stay in the forest and said to her
how is it that sita daughter of janaka king of videha daughterinlaw of dasaratha and wife of rama has to undergo such hardships in the lonely forest
o sita after looking at your countenance which is like a lotus scorched by the sunshine or like a withered waterlily or gold defiled by dust or the moon obscured by the clouds the fire of sorrow is burning my mind the grief in my mind is like fire kindled from the arani sacrificial faggots that consumes its own souree on a circular wood piece a wooden stick is placed and churned to produce fire specially in sacrifices is called arani
while ramas mother was uttering such words in anguish rama reached vasistha and clasped his feet with reverence
rama touched the feet of the family priest vasistha a man equivalent to effulgent fire like indra the lord of the gods does to brihaspati and sat down along with him
after vasistha and rama sat down righteous bharata sat close to his elder brother behind him sat his companions leading citizens soldiers and righteous men
beholding rama attired like an ascetic but radiant with a majestic glow the extremely valiant bharata sat near him with folded palms like the great indra purified by religious austerities sits near brahma the creator
all noble people were truly filled with great curiosity as to what bharata was going to speak after paying his homage and honouring rama
rama who was steadfast in truth lakshmana of great dignity and righteous bharata surrounded by their friends were as resplendent as three sacrificial fires encircled by officiating priests     thus ends the one hundredthird sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
rama with his brother lakshmana having consoled bharata who is ever devoted to elders began to question
i want to hear what brought you to this region with your barkrobes matted locks and antelope skin
what made you come to this region leaving the kingdom and wearing deer skin and matted hair you should tell me everything
thus enquired by the magnanimous rama bharata joining his palms tightly replied
o my revered sire our mighty father having performed an impossible task of banishing you to the forest and tortured by grief due to separation from his son went to heaven
o rama tormentor of enemies having been instigated by a woman my mother kaikeyi committed this great sin of destroying his dasarathas reputation
my mother formented with grief and with the fruit of the kingdom forfeited and cursed with widowhood will fall into the dreadful hell
it behoves you to grant me a favour i am like your servant now get yourself coronated in the kingdom like indra
all these subjects and your widowed mothers have come to you it behoves you to grant them this favour
o bestower of honour by the law of primogeniture and as a worthy successor it is appropriate that you should accept the kingdom righteously and fulfil the desire of your friends
like an autumnal night with the immaculate moon let this entire earth cease to be a widow by securing you as her lord
with my head bowed down i beseech you along with all these ministers to show favour to me who is your brother disciple and slave
o best among men it does not behove you to transgress the prayers of the whole order of subjects and ministers to assume this hereditary and perpetual order
having said thus the mightyarmed bharata in accordance with tradition grasped with tearful eyes the feet of rama again with his head
rama embraced his brother bharata who repeatedly heaved sighs and resembled an elephant in rut and said
how can a man like you born of a noble race endowed with energy powerful and adherent to vows commit a sin for the sake of a kingdom
o destroyer of enemies i do not find even slightest fault with you like a child it does not behove you to reproach your mother
o sagacious and sinless one it is laid down in sastras that elders when married can always act at their free will towards their wives and sons
o handsome one you should treat us the way the virtuous treat their wives sons and disciples in this world
o handsome one king dasaratha is alone competent to accommodate me in the forest wearing bark robes and antelope skin as garment or install me in the kingdom
o best among the protectors of righteousness the honour shown to our father who is conversant with the ways of righteousness and much revered by the world ought to be shown towards our mother also
o bharata i have been commanded by our righteous father and mother to go to the forest how can any one act otherwise
you shall rule the kingdom wellhonoured by the people in ayodhya and i shall live in dandaka forest wearing bark as garments
the maharja of great radiance made this division in the presence of people and after commanding thus ascended heaven
the proclamation of that righteous king revered by the world shall be your guide you should enjoy that portion bestowed by father
o handsome one as for myself i shall enjoy the portion bestowed on me by my magnanimous father and shall take refuge in the dandaka forest for fourteen years
i think what my great father who is honoured by all men and an equal to indra ordered is for my highest welfare the will of the overlord of the world should not be done away with     thus ends the one hundredfourth sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
that night passed off painfully for the four lion like brothers as they lamented surrounded by their hosts of friends
when the night dawned those brothers surrounded by their friends made morning ablutions and after the prayers returned to rama
all of them sat together silently and no one uttered a word bharata alone from among them addressed rama saying
this kingdom was given to me for the satisfaction of my mother i am bestowing it back on you enjoy it without any obstacles
like a dyke bursts under pressure by the great surge of waters during the rainy season this vast kingdom cannot be sustained by any one except yourself
o lord of the earth as an ass cannot follow the pace of a horse or a bird the pace of tarkshya garuda i do not have the capability to follow you
o rama the life of a man on whom others depend for their sustenance is a happy life and the life of one who depends on others for his own mintenance is miserable
o mightyarmed rama a man plants a tree rears it till it grows into such a large tree with a big trunk that it becomes difficult for a dwarf to climb when the tree flowers but does not bear fruit the man who planted it gets no pleasure out of the purpose for which the tree was planted being a mighty protector do not chastise us who are your servants this is a simile you may better comprehend its implicationsthe meaning of the simile is that if you do not assume the throne the desire of our father who nurtured you right from your childhood and hoped that one day you will become king and rule the people will be in vain
o great king and subduer of enemies may all the leading guilds of traders and other subjects behold you all over installed in the kingdom like the resplendent sun
o rama let the elephants following you intoxicated with ichor be heard trumpeting let the women of the inner apartment rejoice with composed minds when they hear of your return
hearing the words of bharata beseeching rama to return various classes of people of the city of ayodhya in approbation exclaimed well said
having seen the illustrious bharata lamenting that way rama a man of firm determination and selfpossession consoled him thus
a man is neither independent nor competent to do any act on his free will fate pulls him this way or the other
all accumulations of wealth deplete at the end every man who attains elevated positions falls at the end every union culminates in separation every life ends in death
the only fear of a ripened fruit is the fear of falling down from the tree in the same way every man who is born has no other fear except the fear of death
even a house constructed with sturdy pillars gets dilapidated and ultimately decays in the same way people under the sway of old age and death are destroyed at last
a night that once passe off does not return like the waters of river yamuna that flow into the ocean filled with water the water do not flow back into yamuna
the passing days and nights quickly decrease the life span of all living beings in this world like sunrays drying up the water in summer
whether you are static or moving your lifespan decreases therefore you should only grieve about yourself and not for any one else
death follows a man wherever he goes when he sits death sits with him even after travelling a very long distance the man returns along with death
wrinkels form on the body and hair turns grey in old age in this way decayed with age what can a man do to have control over death
people rejoice when the sun rises and rejoice when the sun sets but they are unaware of the decline of the life span of their own
at the advent of each new season men feel delighted to see the newly blossomed flowers and fruits but with the change of the scasons the life span also diminishes
in a mighty ocean two pieces of logs meet one another float together and in due course get separated in the same way wives sons relatives and riches remain together for some time and thereafter get separated their separation is certain
no living being in this world can act as he likes therefore no one should grieve for the dead
like a man standing on the wayside says to a passing caravan i am following you and follows them the road taken by our fathers and forefathers is certain for every one and cannot be violated by a person treading that path so why should a man grieve
like the flow of water which never reverts to its source age passes therefore a man must employ his self in righteous acts that bring him happiness by doing so it is said people will always be happy
our righteous father and lord of the earth dasaratha attained heaven by giving abundant charities and performing several sacrifices in accordance with tradition
our father nourished his dependents splendidly governed his subjects and accepted wealth through righteous ways because of these pious acts he could go to heaven
dasaratha our father and lord of the earth reached heaven by performing auspicious acts and offering abundant charities in sacrifices
king dasaratha lord of the earth having performed various kinds of sacrifices and securing a long life enjoyed abundance of pleasures and attained heaven
o dear our father king dasaratha who was honoured by the virtuous and enjoyed the best of pleasures attained heaven after a long life therefore he is not to be grieved over
our father king dasaratha abandoned the wornout mortal body and obtained divine prosperity of wandering in the world of brahma
no one like you or me should ever mourn about this highly sagacious and learned king who was proficient in scriptural knowledge
a wise man holding on to his fortitude in all circumstances should avoid such occasions of grief these words of lamentation and this crying
o foremost of the eloquent compose yourself do not grieve return to the city ayodhya and reside there you have been commanded so by our father who was a man of selfcontrol
i shall also stick to the command of our noble father who was a man of sacred deeds
o subduer of enemies i cannot violate the order of the king you also must respect it for he is our father and friend indeed
o bharata i will therefore obey the command of our venerable father the champion of righteousness by living in the forest
o best of men if a man aspires to conquer the higher world he should remain virtuous compassionate and obedient to his preceptors
o best of men having seen the auspicious life of our father dasaratha and his conduct you also stick to your own duty
rama the magnanimous lord addressed his younger brother bharata with words full of significance saying obey fathers command and remained silent in a moment     thus ends the one hundredfifth sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
rama remained silent after saying these meaningful words on the bank of river mandakini then the bharata conforming to righteousness replied in clear words to the virtuous rama who was affectionate by nature
o subduer of enemies you are of such nature that neither sorrow pains you nor pleasure delights you there are none in this world like you you are loved by the elders for you seek their counsel whenever you have doubts
one should accept life and death vice and virtue equally how can one be afflicted when he has gained such an intellect
o lord of men it is not proper for a person like you who knows the past and the future of human beings to feel distressed and lament over it
o magnanimous rama your nature is divine and you are true to your promises you are omniscient allseeing and wise
it is not proper for a virtuous man like you who is cognizant in matters of life and death to be overwhelmed by such insufferable grief
when i was away from home my meanminded mother committed a sin for my sake which i never wished you may pardon me graciously
i am bound by a bond of righteousness for which i am unble to slay my mother who deserves severe punishment for her sinful acts
how shall i born to dasaratha of noble race and righteous deeds with the knowledge of dharma do such a reprehensible and unrighteous deed
king dasaratha my father and preceptor is godlike to me devoted to meritorious acts he departed from this world in his old age for this reason i cannot reproach him publicly in this assembly of men
o rama conversant with righteousness will any one who knows the meaning of righteousness do such a sinful act contrary to dharma and artha to please a woman
there is an ancient saying that at the time of death the intellect of people is deluded by conducting himself in this way king dasaratha has proved it
our father has trangressed righteousness due to anger or delusion or recklessness therefore you may think over the matter prudently and set it right
one who sets right the wrongs done by his father is a true son otherwise the son becomes just the opposite he is not a son to the father
so be a worthy son and let not the sinful act committed by our father and condemned by men of wisdom be approved by you
protect this entire kingdom kaikeyi me and father our friends and relations citizens of the city and inhabitants of the countryside
where is the forest and where is kshatriyas duty where are matted locks and where is governance of the kingdom it does not behave you to do such acts antithetical to each other
o sagacious one the primary duty of a kshatriya is to be crowned this enables him to rule his subjects
will any kshatriya setting aside his first duty follow an uncertain course of piety which is contrary to his dharma and whose impact may be felt in a remote future
if you so desire to follow the path of dharma acquired out of physical exertion then bear the trouble of governing the four castes of the social order righteously
o rama you are the one who knows his duty the knowers of dharma maintain that the life of a householder is the foremost among the four modes of life how can you renounce it
being younger to you in knowledge position and birth how can i rule the earth when you are present
i am a child deficient in intelligence and virtue and even inferior in position deserted by you i do not wish to live
o one conversant with righteousness rule unhindered this entire kingdom along with our relations inherited from our father
let all ministers subjects and priests including vasistha who are wellversed in vedic hymns consecrate you here itself
after consecration you too return to rule ayodhya along with all of us like indra who went back to heaven accompanied by maruts after conquering all the worlds with his prowess
discharging completely the three debts to gods to ancestors and to sages subduing your enemies and gratifying your friends you alone have the right to dictate me
o my esteemed brother let all your friends be delighted today at your enthronement and your enemies flee in terror in ten different directions
o best of men wiping out all the censure on my mother redeem our revered father from sin
i beseech you with my head bowed low show mercy on me and every one of our relations like maheswara showing compassion on all living beings
if you turn your back on my solicitations and set out for the forest i shall also go along with you from here itself
thus besought and propitiated by bharata with his head bowed low and distressed the virtuous lord of the world rama firmly established in the words of his father resolved not to go back to ayodhya
having seen the wonderful deternmination of rama people were at once anguished and delighted anguished because he would not return to ayodhya and delighted because he was firm in his resolve
all the priests the chiefs of merchant organizations and mothers who had their senses switched off and theif tears drained dry extolled bharata for his words all of them reverentially saluting rama implored him     thus ends the one hundredsixth sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
wellhonoured in the midst of relatives the celebrated rama elder brother of lakshmana then said to bharata who was going to speak again
appropriate are the words spoken by you born to the celebrated king dasaratha through kaikeyi
earlier when our father was to wed your mother o dear brother he had promised to your maternal grandfather that he would confer on her a kingdom with good revenue
thereafter in the battle between gods and demons the able king dasaratha pleased with your mother granted her a boon as a token of gratitude
thereafter o tiger among men your illustrious mother of fair complexion under oath demanded of that best of men king dasaratha the two boons namely kingdom for you and banishment for me bound by such agreement oath the king granted her the boons
o best of men that is why i have been ordered by father to live in the forest for fourteen years as per the condition of the boon
i have come to this lonely forest accompanied by lakshmana and sita bent upon upholding the truth of our unrivalled fathers words
o indra among kings let your coronation be performed without delay since you are worthy and at the same time the truthfulness of our fathers words be honoured
o bharata release for my sake the competent king from his debt of vow and honour the righteous father and the mother as well
dear brother it is heard that long ago an illustrious king while performing a sacrifice intended for ancestors at a sacred place known as gaya the sacrificer gaya chanted a vedic hymn as follows
putra is so called as he delivers his father from a hell known as put and protects the ancestors in all possible ways
one should desire many virtuous and learned sons so that at least one of them may go to gaya to perform the fathers obsequies
o enhancer of the kings delight o best of men rajarsis have decided this way you may therefore o lord protect your father against hell
o valiant bharata go to ayodhya accompanied by satrughna and the twiceborn brahmins and keep the subjects delighted like pleased with your rule
o king bharata i shall also enter the dandaka forest without delay in the company of only these two the princess from videha sita and lakshmana
o bharata be the king of men i shall also become the supreme king of the wild beasts in the forest go now happily to ayodhya the best of cities and i shall enter dandaka forest with delight
let an umbrella protect you against scorching sunshine and provide its cool shade over your head o bharata as for me i shall happily seek the shade of these dense woodland trees
o bharata intelligent satrughna will be your support and son of sumitra lakshmana as is wellknown will remain my best friend all four of us worthy sons of dasaratha shall follow the path of truth of our father      thus ends the one hundredseventh sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
while rama conversant with dharma was consoling bharata jabali an eminent brahmin addressed him in words contrary to righteousness
very well o scion of the raghu race you are nobleminded and highsouled you like a common man must not entertain such nonsensical thought
who is whose friend who is to get what and from whom man is born alone and will die alone
o rama one who establishes relationship by saying she is my mother he is my father is to be regarded as a lunatic in fact no one belongs to any one
a man who goes from one village to another takes rest somewhere on the way and the next day leaves the place and proceeds on his journey similarly father mother home and wealth are restingplaces to a man the wise do not get attached to them o descendant the kakutsthas
o most virtuous of men you ought not to abandon this patrimonial kingdom adopt a course which is painful difficult and full of thorns dangers this course is unwise and unworthy of you
go back to that prosperous city of ayodhya and get yourself coronated that city is a chaste woman wearing a single braid of hair awaiting you her lord
o kings son enjoy inestimable royal pleasures in the city of ayodhya like indra in heaven
dasaratha was nobody to you and you are nobody to him that king is one person and you are another therefore do what i tell you it does not matter what you are to him and what he means to you
for a living being the father is only a drop of white blood semen during her menstrual period this is blended in the mothers womb due to which a man is born in this world
that king dasaratha has gone to the place where he ought to go such is the nature of mortals you are fruitlessly undergoing difficulties
i prity those who yearn for dharma and artha and not for other things since those who have experienced adversities in this world disregarding their own interest will be ultimately destroyed any way by death
people perform ashtaka ceremony for the spirits of ancestors and offer them food look at the amount of food being wasted will the dead ever eat food
if something eaten by one in this world can enter the body of another then a shraddha can be performed for a person who has set out on a distant journey will that offering turn into food for him on his way
it was to induce people to give charity that treatises are composed by intelligent men exhorting perform sacrifices give charity be initiated practise religious austerities renounce etc
o highminded one thinking that the next world does not exist practise whichever is evident and perceivable and turn your back on what is beyond perception
honour the decision of the wise that serves as an instance to all and accept the kingdom offered by bharata with pleasure     thus ends the one hundredeighth sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
hearing jabalis words rama the foremost among the truthful gave a rejoinder exercising his own judgment and firm conviction with due respect to jabali
althoug what you have said appears to be salutary it is actually unwholesome it appears to be beneficial but is really detrimental
a man not bound by morality engaged in evil deeds and conducts himself contrary to good character is not respected by the virtuous
it is only the character that tells whether a man is highborn or not brave or only proud of his manliness honest or dishonest
if like a man who appears noble though ignoble clean though unclean or dishonest auspicious though inauspicious a man of character though depraved i forsake auspicious ways for unrighteousness abandon pious acts and scriptural practices and indulge under the cloak of dharma in acts of wickedness by causing harm and confusion to the world will any sensible man with a sense of discrimination between should and should not hold me in high esteem
how can i advise others for a virtuous conduct or how can i attain heaven if i break the vow which i follow at present
the entire world conducts itself as per its own sweet will therefore the subjects will follow the same path as their kings
truth and nonviolence are the perpetual principles of kings therefore a kingdom is based on truth this world is firmly established in truth
sages and gods all accept truth as the supreme virtue a truthful man of this world attains the highest state abode
people are frightened at the sight of a man speaking untruth as though they have seen a serpent truth in this world is the greatest virtue and is said to be the very foundation of heaven
truth is god the goddess of wealth always takes refuge in truth truth is the root of everything it is supreme and there is nothing above it
charity sacrifice libations mortifications asceticism and the vedas have truth as their foundation therefore every one should be an adherent of truth
one protects the world another runs his family one plunges into hell another is honoured in heaven these are the fruits of truth and untruth
i am always true to any promise i am bound by truth why shouid i now disobey my fathers command to keep his promise
i am always true to my promise i will not break the bridge of truth of my father out of either greed or delusion or ignorance or illusion
we have heard that the offerings of a man inclined to untruth of an unstable and unsteady mind are accepted neither by the gods nor by the ancestors
i personally regard this righteousness practised by the virtuous as an evident form of truth as the supreme self therefore this burden difficult task of living as an exile is gratifying to me
i renounce the socalled kshatriya code of conduct followed by the mean the cruel the greedy and by men of evil deeds which is unrighteousness under the cloak of righteousness
at first a man conceives an evil idea in his mind then executes it through evil deed with his body and tells a lie through his tongue thus sinful action is three dimensional mental physical and vocal
land kingdom glory and wealth pursue a man they long for him even if he is in heaven therefore every one must take recourse to truth alone
the course you thought excellent and this auspicious act you urged me in a cleverlyworded statement to perform is ignoble indeed
having sworn before my father that i would live in the forest how can i act upon bharatas request in disregard to my fathers words
i had taken a firm vow in the presence of my father about my stay in the forest and then devi kaikeyi was immensely delighted
i shall spend the term of my forest life with faith and holiness and purity of mind and with regulated food and with ancestors and gods satisfied with offerings of roots flowers and fruits with my five senses contented and with a mind that discriminates between what ought to be done and what ought not to be done
having reached this land of religious actions one should perform auspicious rites as fruit of their actions agni vayu and soma have obtained their status
after performing a hundred sacrifices king of the gods indra obtained dominion over heaven great sages attained heaven after resorting to intense mortifications
the highly energetic prince rama could not tolerate these atheistic arguments of jabali for which he had to utter these words full of disdain
the virtuous maintain that truthfulness righteousness valour compassion towards all beings speaking pleasing words paying homage to gods brahmins and guests all these are paths to heaven
therefore brahmins who have rightly understood the meaning of righteousness and adopt with unmost care the righteous ways as laid down in the scriptures seek attainment of higher positions
you are a great atheist you have fallen from the path of righteousness you are guided by an intellect which is extremely peridous i therefore disapprove of my fathers decision in inducting a man like you into the council of ministers
just as a thief so is the buddha a wise men know that the tathagatas are atheists they are men most distrusted among the people a learned man should avoid atheistsnote verses to appear to be interpolations it is anachronistic to talk about buddha in tretayuga
men superior to you in preceding generations had conquered this world and the other world by always performing many auspicious acts twiceborn brahmins perform religious acts and offer libations for the welfare of the world
those supreme ascetics who are radiant devoted to righteousness and associated with men of virtue with charity as their chief virtue eschewing violence and purged of their impurities are truly worthy of reverence in this world
having heard the wrathful words of the magnanimous rama of fearless intellect that brahmin jabali thus humbly replied in palatable truthful words full of faith in god
i do not speak the language of atheists i am not an atheist i do not say that the next world does not exist in keeping with time occasion i shall speak the language of a believer or a nonbeliever
o rama since the appropriate time has slowly come i have uttered this in order to persuade you to return and to propitiate you i have said these words      thus ends the one hundredninth sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
seeing rama angry vasistha intercedes saying that jabali is wellaware of the exits and entrances of humans on earth
o lord of the worlds jabali had spoken all this only with the intention to make you return to ayodhya listen i shall now relate to you the origin of the world
at the beginning all this was water from which the earth was created thereafter the selfexistent brahma along with the gods came into existence
then he assumed the form of a boar and uplifted the earth and created this world with his progeny of purified souls
eternal changeless and imperishable brahma arose from space and to him was born marichi and to marichi kasyapa
kasyapa begot vivaswat the sun and vivaswat manu this manu was the first prajapati to him whom was born ikshvaku
manu had orginally bestowed the most prosperous earth on ikshvaku and you know ikshvaku was the first king of ayodhya
ikshvaku had an illustrious son wellknown as kukshi and to kukshi was born the heroic vikukshi
the son of vikukshi was highly energetic and powerful bana and to him was born the mightyarmed anaranya of great renown
when anaranya the best of the virtuous was ruling the kingdom there was no drought no famine and not even a thief in his kingdom
mightyarmed king prithu was the son of anaranya and prithu was father of the great king trishanku that heroic trishanku on account of his truthfulness ascended the heaven with his physical body
trishankus son was illustrious dundhumara father of the exceedingly powerful yuvanaswa
majestic mandhata was yuvanasvas son and father of mighty susandhi sudsandhi had two sons dhruvasandhi and prasenjit renowned bharata slayer of enemies was the son of dhruvasandhi
mightyarmed bharata had a son named asita against whom the haihayas talajanghas and the indomitable sasibindus the rival kings rose as enenmies
although king asita engaged all of them in a battle he was defeated and driven into exile he retired to a delightful tall mountain and lived a life of contentment of a sage
both his wives became pregnant it is said that one of them gave the other poison with the motive to destroy the embryo
o queen you will beget a son who will be magnanimous virtuous renowned in the world he will be the perpetuator of the race and destroyer of enemies
the queen was happy she circumambulated the sage took leave of him and came back home thereafter she gave birth to a son who had eyes like lotus petals and who looked resplendent like brahma
with a motive to destroy the embryo her cowife had poisoned her that child was born with gara or poison for which he was called sagara
the king sagara performed a sacrifice on the fullmoon day and swiftly dug the ocean that frightened the people
we have heard that a son asamanja by name was born to sagara for his sinful deeds he was banished by his father while he was still alive
valiant anshuman was the son of asamanja and the father of dilipa dilipas son was bhagiratha
to bhagiratha was born kakutstha by whom your race is wellknown a son raghu was born to kakutstha and hence all of you are known as raghavas
the illustrious son of raghu became famous in the world under the names of kalmasapada and sowdasa the curse of a sage turned him a devourer of men for some years
shankhana was the famous son of kalmashapada whoever challenged his prowess was routed with his entire army
the son of shankhana was the glorious sudarshana father of agnivarna shighraga was the son of agnivarna whose son was maru marus son was prashushruva and to prashushruva was born splendid ambarisha nahusha of indisputable prowess was the son of ambarisha whose son was the supremely righteous nabhaga nabhaga had two sons aja and suvrata and ajas son was the righteous king dasaratha
being the eldest son of king dasaratha and widely known as rama you happen to be the heir apparent hence o king accept the kingdom and look after the people
vasistha the family priest continued to speak to rama on righteousness
every man born has three preceptors they are his teacher father and mother
o best of men the father brings forth a son the teacher imparts him wisdom therefore the teacher is considered superior
i was preceptor to your father and also to you o destroyer of foes by following my words you will not transgress the path of the virtuous
all these learned men guilds of merchants and the twiceborn brahmins of this assembly are your men by fulfilling your duty towards them you will never swerve from the path of the virtuous
here is your aged and righteous mother it does not behove you to deny your service to her by obeying her you will never deviate from the path of the virtuous
o scion of the raghus whose strength springs from truth and righteousness if you accede to the prayers of bharata you will not ignore the call of your soul
when rama the best of men was advised personally by vasistha the preceptor with sweet words he replied to him who was sitting beside him
the course of action the parents always adopt in respect of their son the benefits they confer on him according to their resources the way they lull him to sleep and clothe him the affectionate words they always speak to him and the way they bring him up all these cannot be repaid
king dasaratha is my father who begot me the promise i made him shall not prove false
having been addressed by rama in this way bharata of great generosity in extreme distress addressing the charioteer who was standing nearby said
o charioteer quickly spread kusa grass on the bare ground until my esteemed brother shows his grace i shall lie down here waiting
like a poor brahmin starving my face muffled i shall lie down in front of the hut until he agrees to return
bharata was mentally disturbed saw sumantra waiting for ramas order then he himself brought a heap of kusa grass and spread it on the ground
rama the foremost of royal sages and highly powerful said dear bharata what wrong have i done that you should prevent me by lying down in front of me
a brahmin alone is competent in this world to prevent a person by lying down on one side in front of him one who is anointed king is not permitted by scriptural tradition to squat in protest
o bharata o tiger among men o scion of the raghu race give up this formidable vow arise and quickly return to ayodhya the best of cities
while remaining seated bharata looking all around at the inhabitants from towns and villages questioned them why dont you all persuade my esteemed brother to return
those inhabitants from towns and villages replied to the magnanimous bharata we know the scion of the kakutha dynasty rama very well what he has said is proper
highly distinguished rama is firmly fixed on the command of his father that is why we are incapable of making him return quickly
having understood their words rama said to him listen to the words of our friends who have a righteous vision
o mightyarmed son of the raghus you have heard both them and me carefully think over arise touch me and sip water
then bharata stood up and performed achamana sipping of water and said let the assembly of learned men counsellors and guildsmen hear me
i never asked my father to confer the kingdom on me i never urged my mother to seek the kingdom for me i never supported the exile of my esteemed brother rama who is supreme in the knowleldge of righteousness
if it is absolutely essential to live in the forest in accordance with the command of my father i myself shall also dwell in the forest for fourteen years
on hearing the genuine sentiments of his brother righteous rama was astonished he said to the inhabitants from towns and villages
neither bharata nor i can in any way annul anything which was sold pledged or bought by my father during his lifetime
as far as living in the forest is concerned it is reprehensible to keep a subsitute for me and it shall not be done kaikeyi has acted rightfully and my father has taken the proper decision
i know bharata as a man of forbearance and one who honours elders everything will turn out well for this great soul wedded to truth
on returning from the forest i shall become the supreme lord of this earth along with this virtuous brother
the king dasaratha was solicited by kaikeyi and i shall abide therefore you also release the lord of the earth our father from the charge of falsehood      thus ends the hundredeleventh sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
the great sages assembled there were amazed at witnessing the meeting of the two brothers rama and bharata of umparalleled briliance
the hosts of sages siddhas and devarshis watching invisible the two kakutstha brothers extoled them
on hearing their dialogue we are deeply drawn towards them these two sons of king dasaratha who was fortunate to have these practioners of righteousness and whose strength is dharma
thereafter hosts of rishis desiring the speedy destruction of tenheaded ravana said these words to bharata the best of kings
o bharata born in an illustrious race highly sagacious and a man of virtuous conduct and great renown accept ramas proposal if you have any regard for your father
we always desire that rama should discharge his debt to his father dasaratha who by redeeming himself of his obligation to kaikeyi had ascended heaven
then the great rishis gandharvas and royal sages having said this returned to their respective abodes
of pleasing appearance rama gladdened by the auspicious statements of the sages paid them homage with a cheerful countenance
before bharata with his limbs trembling and with palms folded in reverence was ready to depart he said to rama
o rama keeping in view the code of kings and tradition of our family it behoves you to consider my supplication and that of my mother
i do not venture to protect this kingdom all by myself and keep the inhabitants of the towns and villages who are loyal to you pleased
all our relatives warriors friends and wellwishers long to see you like farmers yearn for the raincloud
o sagacious rama accept this kingdom and ensure its stability you are powerful enough to govern this world so accept this kingdom and restore its stability
having said this bharata fell at the feet of his brother and speaking sweetly he profusely entreated rama
rama took his in his arms bharata who had a darkblue complexion whose eyes were like petals of lotus and whose voice was the voice of an amorous swan
o child this wisdom of yours is both inborn and imbibed through training with this you are perfectly capable of protecting the earth
after due consultation with ministers friends counsellors and prudent persons accomplish all tasks however formidable they may appear
the moon might lose its splendour snow might abandon the himavat mountain the ocean might overstep its shores but i shall not forsake the promise made to my father
dear brother whether out of affection or greed your mother has done this for your sake it should not agitate your mind you should conduct yourself as one should towards ones mother
on hearing this bharata replied to the son of kausalya who looked like the sun or the new moon in brilliance
o noble one place your feet on these sandals decorated with gold they will secure the prosperity and safety of the entire world
rama the best of men one with great brilliance put on and then put off the sandals and presented them to the magnanimous bharata
bharata bowed before the sandals and said to rama o tormentorr of enemies o hero wearing matted locks and bark garments living on fruits and roots placing the responsibility of ruling the kingdom on your sandals and looking forward to your arrival i shall reside outside the city for fourteen years
o best of the raghus if i do not behold you on the day after completion of fourteen years i shall enter the blazing fire
be it so assured rama and then affectionately embracing both bharata and satrughna said to bharata
look after your mother o chief of the raghus do not be angry with her swear in my name and in the name of sita so saying eyes filled with tears rama took leave of his brother
the valiant and righteous bharata worshipped the welldecorated sandals and after circumambulating rama reverentially placed them atop the best of elephants
inflexibly fixed in his own code of righteouness like the himavat mountain rama the enhancer of the progeny of the raghu dynasty paid respect due to the preceptors ministers and subjects in accordance with their rank blessed his younger brothers bharata and satrughna and sent them forth
his mothers were unable to bid him farewell their throats were choked with tears of sorrow but rama himself paid obeisance to them and entered his hut in tears     thus ends the hundredtwelfth sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
then bharata accompanied by satrughna placing the sandals on his head in delight boarded the chariot
vasishta vamadeva jabali of rigorous penance and all the ministers honoured for their counsel proceeded ahead
all of them circumambulated the mighty mountain chitrakuta and proceeded east towards the charming river mandakini
beholding a thousand varieties of beautiful minerals bharata with his army proceeded alongside the mountain
not far from chitrakuta mountain bharata beheld a hermitage where sage bharadwaja resided
on approaching the hermitage of sage bharadwaja bharata alighted from the chariot and prostrated at his feet
then bhardwaja asked bharata in delight my son have you accomplished your task did you meet rama
having been thus addressed by wise bharadwaja bharata devoted to righteousness replied
entreated by me and by preceptor vasistha the highly pleased rama with his firmness of mind replied to vasistha
in sooth i shall honour the words of promise given by my father and live in the forest for fourteen years as promised
on hearing him vasistha a great intellectual and highly eloquent one replied to rama skilled in words of deep significance
o extremely sagacious one bestow with pleasure your sandals decked with gold for security and safety of ayodhya
thus addressed by vasistha rama stood facing eastward wearing these sandals and bestowed them on me for the sake of ruling the kingdom
i am now returning to ayodhya with these auspicious sandals permitted by the magnanimous rama
hearing the auspicious words of the magnanimous bharata sage bharadwaja said to him in words still more auspicious
o best of men foremost among men of excellent character and dispositon it is not surprising that all noble qualities come to reside in you naturally like water poured flowing downward
with you as his son endowed with qualities of righteousness and devotion to duty your mightyarmed father dasaratha is not dead he lives through you
hearing the words of the magnanimous bharadwaja bharata paid his respect folding his palms and clasping the feet of the sage and sought his permission to leave
then illustrious bharata circumambulated the sage several times in homage before he set out for ayodhya with his counsellors
the vast army of bharata with all its carriages carts horses and elephants following him again turned back towards ayodhya
thereafter all of them crossed the divine river yamuna wreathed in waves and beheld the ganga of sacred waters once again
bharata along with his kins and his army crossed the ganga with its overflowing wonderful waters and entered the beautiful city of sringiberapura and from there he proceeded until he beheld the city of ayodhya
on seeing the city of ayodhya bereft of his father and brothers bharata consumed with grief said to the charioteer
o charioteer look ayodhya is in shapeless shambles it is silent and cheerless it is dull and desolate it shines no more     thus ends the hundredthirteenth sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
bharata the renowned lord of ayodhya travelled on the chariot that produced a deep soothing sound and entered ayodhya soon
the city looked like rohini the beloved consort of the moon the star which was majesticlly radiating flaming brilliance and now tormented by the exalted rahu which has eclipsed the moon shines alone
it appeared like a lean mountainstream with scant hot and turbid waters with scorched aquatic birds and with small and large fishes and crocodiles dead due to the heat of the sun
warriors slain in the great battle the city appeared desolate
the midst of the herd despairs and no longer grazes the new grass
with the melodious humming of intoxicated bees and suddenly shrivelling ravaged by the fastspreading forest fire
ayodhya with its markets and shops closed and its merchants in a daze looked like the sky covered with clouds obscuring the moon and stars
a dale
illustrious bharata son of dasaratha seated in his chariot addressed the charioteer as he drove the most excellent of chariots saying
how is it that in ayodhya the deep and allpervasive songs and sounds of musical instruments of the former days are not heard now
the breeze no longer carries the intoxicating odour of spirituous liquor the pervading fragrance of flower garlands and agaru incense
after ramas the exile the clatter of excellent carriages the pleasing neighing of horses and trumpeting of elephants in rut and the rattle of chariots are no longer heard now
since rama has departed the young men in distress do not enjoy expensive incense of agaru and sandalwood paste and garlands of fresh flowers
this city is stricken with grief on account of ramas departure men do not go out on pleasure jaunts wearing garlands of variegated flowers festivities are not celebrated
certainly splendour has left along with my brother like the night when the rain pours down during the waning of the moon ayodhya shines not
when will my brother return to ayodhya like a carnival and cause delight to every one like summer clouds
the highways of ayodhya thronged with groups of elegantly attired young men or adults with their majestic gait do not shine
thus mourning in several ways bharata entered his fathers palace now bereft of the king like a cave without the lion
after keeping his mothers in ayodhya the griefstricken bharata who was firm in his vows said to the elders
i take leave of all of you i am going to nandigrama where i shall keep company with grief on account of ramas absence
king dasaratha has gone to heaven my elder brother and guru is in the forest i shall await his return for ruling the kingdom since he alone is the illustrious king of ayodhya
hearing the auspicious words of the magnanimous bharata the counsellors priests including vasistha replied
o bharata the words you have uttered out of devotion to your brother which befit you alone are highly praiseworthy
you are always attached to your relations firmly established in the welfare of your brothers and are pursuing a noble path who would not approve of this
on hearing the pleasing words of the counsellors which were in conformity with his desire bharata said to his charioteer harness my chariot
with a cheerful countenance illustrious bharata paid obeisance to all his mothers and acompanied by satrughna ascended the chariot
highly pleased bharata and satrughna ascended the chariot and surrounded by counsellors and priests set out speedily
preceded by preceptors like vasistha and other brahmins all of them proceeded eastward in the direction of nandigrama
when bharata left the army with hordes of elephants horses and chariots and inhabitants of ayodhya followed him unbidden
righteous bharata who was deeply attached to his brother proceeded speedily towards nandigrama on the chariot bearing the sandals of rama on his head
bharata entered nandigrama quickly alighted from the chariot and then addressing the preceptors said
my brother gave me this kingdom as a trust he gave me the sandals decorated with gold for securing the prosperity and security of the kingdom
then bharata placed the sandals held in trust on his head and overcome with grief he addressed the concourse of subjects
hold the royal paresol now this is the accepted symbol of the exalted feet of my brother these sandals shall establish righteousness in the kingdom
this kingdom has been given me by my brother out of affection as a trust i shall safeguard it until ramas return
i myself shall see soon ramas feet reunited with these sandals
the burden of this kingdom has been cast on me on reunion with rama i shall hand it over to my brother my guru and shall be engaged in his service
restoring the sacred sandals the kingdom and this city of ayodhya held as a trust by me i shall be cleansed of the sin
after rama is coronated and the people are delighted and pleased the renown and pleasure for me will be fourfold what is obtained from ruling the kingdom
thus lamenting in desolation and grief the illustrious bharata lived in nandigrama along with his counsellors and started ruling the kingdom
bharata the warrior and lord wore bark garments and matted locks and lived the life of an ascetic in nandigrama along with his army
bharata who was attached to his brother and ever obedient to him fulfilled his vow he coronated the sandals and lived at nandigrama longing for the return of rama
bharata reported everything relating to the kingdom to the sandals first waving the chamaras a fan made of yak tail himself he held the royal parasol over them
after the coronation of the sandals of his esteemed brother rama illustrious bharata ruled the kingdom subordianating himself to them
whenever an issue however small arose bharata kept the sandals informed whenever a valuable gift was presented he offered it to the sandals before he accepted it      thus ends the hundredfifteenth sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
after bharta had departed rama who was living in the penancegrove of ascetics observed that the ascetics were filled with apprehensions and were eager to leave that forest
rama observed that the sages who earlier sought to stay with him near his hermitage under his protection on chitrakuta were filled with anxiety now
those sages glancing at rama with suspicious eyes knitting their eyebrows and murmering among themselves conversed secretly
having observed their anxiety rama apprehending somethig in his mind approached the chief of the hermitage with folded palms and said
o revered sire have you seen any change in my conduct for what reason are the sages looking perturbed
have the sages found my younger brother lakshmana doing something unbecoming of him through inadvertence
has sita devoted in her service to me and engaged in serving you failed to follow the conduct befitting a woman
hearing those words an ascetic old in age and austerities as though trembling said to rama who is compassionate to all beings
o dear child how can goodnatured sita who is always engaged in performing auspicious deeds especially towards ascetics be associated with violation of duty
there is apprehension for ascetics from the demons on acount of your presence here that is why they are conversing with one another about the likely fallout
o dear child khara one of the brothers of ravana is dwelling in nearby janasthana he is impudent reportedly winner of battles cruel sinful a maneater and haughty he has uprooted all the ascetics from janasthana he will not tolerate even you
o dear child ever since you started residing in this hermitage rakshasas have been tormenting the ascetics
they appear in various distorted forms now rapacious now fearful now deformed
those wicked rakshasas employ forbidden and dirty means against ascetics and kill them by suddenly appearing in front of them
these debased rakshasas concealing themselves in various ashram sites take delight in harassing and killing the ascetics
when sacrifices are about to start they throw away the sacrificial ladels and vessels containing sacrificial materials and sprinkle water on sacrificial fire they also break down the earthen vessels used in the sacrifice
now all these sages are urging me to abandon this hermitage infested by these wicked rakshasas and move to another region
o rama those vile creatures resort to physical violence against ascetics we have therefore resolved to quit this ashram
not very far from here stands an ancient ashram in a lovely forest abounding in roots and fruits and i with my companions will seek shelter there
dear child khara will also misbehave with you as usual therefore if you so decide you may come along with us
o rama even though you are always vigilant and capable in all possible ways to defend youself a doubt arises in our mind it is perilous for you to live here with your wife
it was not possible for prince rama to hold back by mere words that ascetic who was saying like this and was anxious to quit the hermitage
the leader of the group quit the hermitage along with his companions after paying respect to rama convincing him and taking leave of him
rama followed the sages for some distance to bid them farewell he paid obeisance to the chief of the group and having grasped the instruction of the highly pleased sages he with their consent returned to his holy hermitage
lord rama did not leave that hermitage deserted by the sages even for a moment those who had adopted the traditions of the sages and had acquired many virtues followed rama     thus ends the hundredsixteenth sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
when the ascetics had departed rama thought over the matter well and did not like to reside there for many reasons
it is here that bharata mothers along with citizens of ayodhya have visited me that memory soaked with grief is chasing me
due to the encampment of the army of the magnanimous bharata here this place has been filled with the dung of horses and elephants and made exceedingly dirty
we shall therefore go to some other place having resolved thus rama accompanied by sita and lakshmana set forth
having reached the hermitage of the revered sage atri illustrious rama prostrated before him and atri also received him as his son
that sage atri himself extended to rama the hospitality befitting him in all possible ways and treated lakshmana and highly virtuous sita with kind words
conversant in the ways of righteousness and eagaged in the welfate of all beings sage atri called out his aged wife who is revered by all and spoke kind words to her
atri who was excellent among the sages said to his ascetic wife who was highly virtuous and an adherent of righteousness welcome sita thereafter he related to rama a story about his asetic wife who follows the ways of righteousness
o blameless one rama once this world was consecutively ravaged by drought for ten years it was the virtuous anasuya who created roots and fruits and caused ganga to flow she was engaged in severe mortifications and selfimposed religious observances she practised severe asceticism for ten thousand years bathed in her vows solicited on behalf of the gods she removed all impediments and converted ten nights into one she is like a your mother to you
she is renowned throughout this world for her deeds as anasuya one who is free from anger aged illustrious she is free frm anger worthy of adoration by all beings let sita approach her
hearing those words of the sage rama said be it so and said to righteous sita these choice words
o princess you have heard the message of the sage without delay approach the ascetic anasuya for your welfare
having heard the words of rama intended for her welfare sita daughter of the king of mithila approached the consort of atri devi anasuya knower of righteousness and reverently circumambulated her
highly chaste and fortunate anasuya was very old and feeble her skin was wrinkled and her hair turned grey due to old age her body was constantly trembling like a plantain tree in a stormy wind pronouncing her name to such anasuya sita made obeisance to her with utmost concentration
sita offered her obeisance to the blameless ascetic anasuya folding her palms and enquired of her wellbeing in delight
anasuya was delighted to see the glorious sita who was always engaged in righteous acts and said in kind words you are fortunate you are observing your rightful duty
o noble sita by the grace of heaven you are following rama forsaking your kinsmen and wealth and confining yourself to the forest
one who is devoted to her husband whether he be in the city or in the forest whether he is sinful or virtuous will attain the most prosperous worlds
for a woman of noble nature her husband whether he be licentious or of bad character or devoid of riches is her supreme lord
o sita on reflection i know of none who is a better friend than the husband he like an imperishable penance once acquired is never lost
those wicked women whose minds are overpowered by carnal desires ranging at will as lords of their husbands do not understand about vice and virtue
o sita those women under the control of unworthy acts are dislodged from the path of righteousness and get infamy
women like you who are endowed with virtues and can distinguish between good and bad in this world like those who perform virtuous deeds will move about in heaven
when anasuya thus addressed vaidehi who is free from any malice she worshipped anasuya and started speaking in a gentle tone
it is no wonder that a noble lady like you should instruct me this way it is known to me that a husband is a guru to his wife
o noble lady even if my husband is devoid of good conduct he should be obeyed without showing any hesitation
what to speak of a husband if he is worthy of applause for his virtues is compassionate a subduer of the senses righteous and ever affectionate like a mother and a father
mighty rama shows the same behaviour and treatment towards the other consorts of the king as he does towards his own mother kausalya
heroic rama is affectionate towards king dasaratha and is conversant with righteousness renouncing the sense of selfrespect he honours all the women on whom his father had cast his glance even once just as his own mother
when departing for this frightful and desolate forest the great advice imparted by my motherinlaw is firmly fixed in my mind
when i have been taught by my mother earlier at the time of bestowal of my hand to rama in the presence of the sacrificial fire as witness is etched in my mind
o righteous one anasuya after listening to your words the instructions given by my motherinlaw and my mother are renewed remembered again for a woman no other penance is laid down in scriptures except service to her husband
having served her husband faithfully savitri is honoured in heaven you also by following the same path of serving your husband shall reach the heaven
rohini the very best among all women and the goddess of heaven is never seen in the sky separated from the moon even for a moment
execellent women such as these firm in their vows to their husband are highly revered in the world of gods through their own meritorious deeds
thereafter hearing sitas words anasuya affectionately kissed her forehead and said this in order to make her happy
o sita of pure conduct i have great ascetic power obtained through practising various austerities with its strength i shall give what you want for your enjoyment
o sita i am glad to hear your befitting and pleasing words tell me what appropriate thing you desire and i shall give you
on hearing her words sita was surprised with a gentle smile she said to anasuya who was endowed with ascetic power i think you have already granted me the boons
when sita said so anasuya who knew her righteous duty was immensely pleased and replied what a joy i shall make the words you have spoken come true
o princess of videha o sita i bestow on you this best garland of the gods raiment jewellery fragrant unguents and precious ointment for anointing your body with all this will beautify your limbs it is convenient to use and will never fade
o daughter of janaka you will enhance the glory of your husband by anointing your body with this divine fragrant unguent to your body like lakshmi enhancing the glory of eternal visnu
that princess from mithila accepted the incomparable gifts of love the raiment fragrant unguents jewellery and also the garland
illustrious sita accepted the gifts of love and with palms folded in reverence sat beside her an ascetic
anasuya who was firm in her vows commenced to ask sita this way about a certain tale that was close to her heart
o sita i have heard that you have been won by the illustrious rama in the swayamvara at least that is the story which reached my ears
o daughter of mithila i would like to hear the story in detail you should tell me the whole story as you experienced it
listen said sita thus addressed and began relating the story to anasuya a performer of austerities
there is a king in mithila janaka by name he is heroic and is conversant with righteousness engaged in the duties of a kshatriya he is rules the earth with justice
when he was ploughing the circular plot of land for performing a sacrifice it is said i emerged from the earth by breaking it and therefore i became his dauhghter
engaged in sowing fistfuls of seeds king janaka found me covered with dust and was astonished
as he had no children he on his own accord lifted me up and placing me on his lap saying this is my daughter he began showering lots of love on me
o king she is an incomparable divine being by right she is your daughter these were the words janaka heard from out of the sky
thereafter my father and the righteous lord of mithila was delighted in possessing me when a noble thought struck his mind
bestowed as the choicest one of meritorious acts on the chief queen i was brought up by her by nature affectionate with the love of a mother
when my father saw i had attained the marriageable age he was immersed in sorrow like an indigent man who had lost all his wealth
even though he was an indra on earth as a father of an unmarried girl he would be humiliated by men who are his equal or inferior in this world
having perceived that the humiliation is not very far king janaka was plunged in a sea of sorrow like one who cannot reach the shore without a float
the ruler of the earth knew that i was not born from a womans womb and could not find a suitable husband for me after deep reflection
after constantly pondering over the matter the wise king arrived at the decision to perform a swayamvara for his daughter
magnanimous varuna out of his affection had given him on the occasion of a great sacrifice an excellent bow with inexhaustible arrows and a pair of quivers
because of its weight no human could move that bow despite great effort nor were the kings capable of bending it even in their dreams
my truthful father after having acquired the bow invited all the princes and placed the great bow before them in the assembly where he declared
beholding the mighty bow resembling a mountain in weight the kings unable to lift it paid their homage and left
after a long time resplendent rama whose prowess was truth arrived along with his brother lakshman and sage viswamitra in order to witness the sacrifice
having accepted the honour extended by my father righteous viswamitra spoke to him about those two brothers rama and lakshmana
both these sons of king dasaratha wish to see the bow show the divine bow to prince rama
at the words of that ascetic my father brought out the bow mighty and valiant rama bent it and strung it and drew it in the twinkling of an eye
when rama was stringing the bow with force it was broken into two in the middle and fell down with a dreadful sound like that of thunder
then my father steadfast in truth held a vessel of pure water and declared his decision to offer me to rama
then rama did not accept the offer of my father straightaway before he knew the opinion of his father dasaratha king of ayodhya
thereafter my fatherinlaw the aged king dasaratha was invited and my father offered me to rama known for his sagacity
my father on his own accord bestowed urmila my younger sister of chaste and of pleasing appearance as wife to lakshmana
in this way my father bestowed me on rama in that swayamvara and i remain devoted to my husband who is the foremost among the valiant in treading the path of righteousness     thus ends the one hundredeighteenth sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
then righteous anasuya having heard the great story of sita kissed her on the forehead and embraced her with both the arms
you have related wonderfully and sweetly your swayamvara with each word and each syllable uttered clearly i have heard everything as it happened o sweetspeaking sita i have greatly enjoyed your story
the resplendent sun has set the auspcious night is drawing near the birds who forage far and wide for food during the day return to their nests to rest for the night you can hear them twittering
the sages also are returning in groups with waterpitchers filled with water and their bark robes soaked with water after their ceremonial bath
the ascetics have duly offered oblations to the fire in agnihotra sacrifices and the smoke tawny like the pigeons body emanates wafted by the wind
the trees with sparse leaves all over have grown dense the quarters in the distant region are no longer discernible by the senses
the night rangers have started moving everywhere and the deer in the penance grove are beginning to sleep around the sacred altars
o sita adorned with stars the night has commenced you can see the moon rising in the sky spreading his mantle of light
with my permission you may go now and be a companion of rama i am thoroughly contented with your story told so sweetly
o sita adorn yourself in my presence dear child permit me the pleasure of adorning you with these divine ornaments
sita adorned looked like the daughter of a god she bowed at the feet of anasuya in reverence and set out to meet rama
rama the most eloquent among men saw sita adorned and rejoiced at the gifts of love given by the ascetic anasuya
sita the princess of mithila related everything to rama and showed him the gifts of love given by ascetic anasuya raiment jewellery and garlands
rama the great charioteer and lakshmana were exceedingly gratified to see the honour conferred on sita rare among mortals
thereafter the descendant of raghu whose countenance resembled the moon having received the hospitality of the accomplished ascetics passed that holy night in delight
night over the two best men rama and lakshmana after their ablution took leave of the ascetics inhabiting the forest who offered morning oblations to the fire
the righteous ascetics dwelling in the forest informed both rama and lakshmana that part of the forest infested by demons
o rama this great forest is haunted by carnivorous demons who can assume any form and by blooddrinking wild animals
o rama in this great forest demons will devour the ascetics if they find them impure or intoxicated or indolent prevent them
o rama this is the one path in the forest used by the ascetics to gather fruits you can safely cross the otherwise impassable forest through this path
the ascetics offered their blessings to rama the tormentor of enemies thereafter accompanied by his wife and lakshmana he entered the great forest like the sun entering the mass of clouds         thus ends the hundrednineteenth sarga in ayodhyakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki

sri rama is like visnu in prowess the moon in pleasing appearance the allconsuming fire in anger the earth in patience kubera in chartiy and the sun in steadfastness
with a desire to promote the welfare of the people king dasaratha decided to install sri rama his eldest and affectionate son as heir apparent who was bestowed with all excellent qualities and true prowess beloved of the people he was ever intent in the welfare of the people
thereafter having seen the preparations for installation of rama queen kaikeyi who had been promised earlier with boons by dasaratha demanded of him the exile of rama and enthronement of bharata
dasaratha true to his word and restrained by the bond of duty sent his beloved son rama to the forest
mighty sri rama inorder to please kaikeyi and obey the word of command of his father went to the forest and help the king to keep his promise to kaikeyi
lakshmana beloved brother to rama is drawn towards him endowed with modesty he is an enhancer of the joy of his mother sumitra displaying his fraternal love he followed rama who was departing to the forest
born in the race of janaka and daughterinlaw of dasaratha sita beloved spouse of rama is like his vital breath always desired the wellbeing of rama she followed him like rohini the moon endowed with all virtues she is the foremost woman
the citizens and dasaratha followed rama for a long distance rama of righteous nature having approached guha king of nishadas at shrungiberapura sent back charioteer sumantra and rama along with sita and lakshmana crossed river ganga
moving from one forest to another and crossing deep and wide rivers with plenty of waters reached the chitrakuta mountain by the command of sage bharadwaja they raised a hut made of leaves in the forest located in chitrakuta mountain and dwelt there happily resembling devas and gandharvas
when rama had set out to chitrakuta king dasaratha stricken by the grief over the separation from his son and mourning over him departed to heavens
after dasaratha had passed away mighty bharata did not desire to rule the kingdom against the orders by vasishta and other brahmins
the brave bharata who had conquered envy and hatred went to the forest in order to worship ramas feet
bharata reached rama so pleasing venerable truthful and chivalrous worshipped him with reverence and implored bharata addressing rama said you are knower of righteousness you alone should be the king meaning that when the elder brother is alive the younger brother is prohibited from ruling the kingdom
although a source of universal delight although exceedingly generous and of cheerful countenance highly renowned and capable rama refused to accept the kingdom in accordance with the command of his father
having handed over his sandals to bharata as symbol of authority for ruling the kingdom rama persuaded him again and again to return to the capital
disaaponted in his mission to take rama back bharata worshipped the sandals of rama and ruled the kingdom from nandigrama awaiting his return
when bharata departed sri rama a man of good fortune and steadfast in vows one who had conquered under control perceiving that the citizens from ayodhya would arrive there entered the dandaka forest with single minded determination so that there would not be breach of his promise
having entered the dense forest dandaka rama slew the demon viradha and saw the sages sarabhanga sutikshna and agastya with his brother
as directed by sage agastya rama received with extreme delight a bow a sword and quivers with inexhaustible arrows given by indra to agastya to be passed on to rama
while rama was dwelling in the forest in the hermitage of sage sarabhanga all the ascetics along with others sages inhabiting the forest approached rama requesting for the destruction of the asuras and rakshasas seizing upon their lives
rama promised those ascetics who resembled flaming fire in lustre living in dandakaranya inhabited by rakshasas to slay them
during his stay there a demon called surpanakha living in janasthana resting place for the army of ravana in dandakaranya and capable of assuming any form at will was rendered deformed by lakshmana
thereafter rama killed in the fight all the rakshasas khara trisira and dushana with their followers in a battle who were instigated by surpanakhas words
during his stay in that forest rama killed fourteen thousand rakshasas who were inhabitants of janasthana
having heard the slaughter of fellow rakshasa ravana became violent with anger and sought the help of a rakshasa named maricha
maricha repeatedly dissuaded him saying o ravana it is not proper for you to enter into hostility with the mighty and powerful rama
disregarding his words ravana incited by fate left for the hermitage of rama along with maricha
he with the help of deceitful maricha drew the princes rama and lakshmana far away from their hermitage abducted sita the wife of rama and slaughtered vulture jatayu
having seen and heard from the eagle jatayu struck down by ravana that sita had been abducted rama bewailed choked with tears his senses dulled by distress
then he performed in the midst of tears the funeral rites of the vulture jatayu wandering in search of sita he beheld a rakshasa named kabandha who was dreadful in deformed in appearance
mightyarmed rama having killed kabandha consigned his body to flames while leaving for heavens he informed him saying o raghava there is a female ascetic in sabara community performing religious duties and proficient in practising austerities you may visit her
rama son of dasaratha destroyer of enemies and possessing great splendour approached sabari who duly worshipped him
on the bank of pampa he met a monkey named hanuman on whose advice he made friendship with sugriva
mighty rama related to sugriva all that had happened right from the beginning more importantly sitas abduction and also to hanuman
hearing everything that story from rama sugriva was very pleased and made a pact with rama in the presence of agni as witness
thereafter sugriva king of monkeys filled with sorrow narrated to rama out of friendship the entire account of his hostilities with vali
then rama vowed to slay vali the monkey sugriva described about valis prowess to rama
doubtful of the prowess sugriva of rama sugriva inorder to get convinced showed him the huge dead body of dundubhi resembling a big mountain
the strongarmed rama who was endowed with great strength looked at the skeleton and smiled within himself for a while he kicked off the skeleton with the great toe of his foot completely to a full distance of ten yojanas eighty miles
again inorder to create confidence in sugriva he released a single mighty shaft which penetrated seven palmyra trees a mountain and the rasatala
pleased with ramas action and convinced of his prowess he left thereafter with rama he left for kishkindha which was like a cave
on entering the city of kishkindha sugriva the best of monkeys of reddish yellow hue roared with a great voice there upon vali the lord of monkeys came out of the cave
after convincing his wife tara who was dissuading from this vali entered into a combat with sugriva there rama killed vali with a single shaft
after he killed vali in the combat in compliance with the words of sugriva rama installed sugriva as king
the best of monkeys sugriva gathered his monkey forces and despatched them in various directions in search of janakas daughter sita
at the suggestion of the vulture sampathi mighty hanuman leapt over the saltocean extending over a hundred yojanas
hanuman arrived at the city of lanka ruled by ravana and found sita in the ashoka garden meditating on rama
hanuman delivered ramas ring to sita as a token of recognition related the whole story and consoled her he then crushed the arch of the outer gate of the garden before leaving
after killing five commanders seven sons of the counsellors stamping out valiant akshayakumara the son of ravana hanuman got himself captured to be taken as captive
the heroic hanuman came to know that he could be released from the entanglements of the weapon granted to him through a boon by brahma he allowed himself to be restrained by the rakshasas with the ropes for the sake of achieving his other objective of seeing ravana thereafter he burnt the whole of lanka except the place where sita was and returned to deliver the good news to rama
reaching rama the great hanuman gifted with boundless intellect circumambulated him and infact informed him that he had seen sita
thereafter rama reached the shore of the ocean together with sugriva and saw the ocean agitated with shafts burning like the sun
samudra lord of rivers afraid of ramas anger and having appeared in his own form and on his advice got a bridge built with the help of nala
rama entered the city of lanka by means of that bridge killed ravana in the battle and recovered sita thereafter he felt greatly embarassed for accepting his wife who had stayed in an others
rama spoke harsh words about sita in the assembly sita incapable of enduring such words entered fire
with the of testimony of the firegod rama was exceedingly pleased to know that sita was sinless all the gods adored him
all the animate and inanimate beings gods and sages in the three worlds were very pleased at this noble deed of the great rama
after coronating the rakshasa chief vibhishana in the city of lanka rama free from distress exceedingly rejoiced after having accomplished his objective
having obtained a boon from the devatas who had come to see him rama revived all monkeys fallen in the battle and set out for ayodhya accompanied by friends in the pushpaka aerial car
rama who was a delight of all whose strength lies in truth went to the hermitage of bharadwaja as promised and despatched hanuman to bharata as his messenger
again accompanied by sugriva and recalling earlier incidents and after both of them discussed with each other rama departed to nandigrama riding that pushpaka chariot
at nandigrama sinless rama arrived met his brothers they shed their matted locks with sita restored he regained his kingdom
the entire world rejoiced with happiness with their desire fulfilled they were content all people were following the path of righteousness there was no fear of sufferings or agonies diseases or famine
during the period of ramas rule no where would men witness the death of their sons or women widowed they would ever remain chaste and devoted to their husbands
there in the kingdom of rama was no fear of fire water wind disease hunger and also theft
all the cities and villages were affluent with wealth and food grains people lived happily as though they lived in kritayuga
highly renowned rama having satisfied the gods with the performance of a hundred of aswamedhas and many suvarnakas bestowing hundreds of thousands of cows and immense wealth on the brahmins will return to brahmaloka
rama will establish hundredfold royal dynasties and employ the four castes to do their respective duties in this world

on hearing the words of narada the distinguished and righteous sage valmiki proficient in composing slokas worshipped him along with his disciples
the divine sage narada after having been worshipped by valmiki in a befitting manner sought his leave and went to heaven
after narada had gone to devaloka sage valmiki reached the bank of river tamasa which is not very far from the ganges for morning ablutions
the eminent sage valmiki reached the bank of tamasa and seen a descent into the river with pellucid waters spoke to the disciple standing by the side
o bharadwaja behold the beautiful and pleasant waters of this river this holy spot is as clear and pure as the mind of a virtuous man
o dear one put down the pitcher on the ground give me my garment i shall take a dip in tamasa the holiest of places
asked thus by the nobleminded master valmiki bharadwaja ever obedient to his spiritual master gave the sage the bark garment
valmiki who had his senses under his command received the barkgarment from the hands of his disciple and wandered about in that extensive forest looking all around
sage valmiki espied a pair of melodious kraunchas flying about in each others in separable company there in its vicinity
a sinful and cruelhearted hunter struck down the male bird of the pair in his very presence
the female companion saw the male bird struck down by the hunter and rolling on the earth drenched in blood separated from her winged comparion with coppercrested head intoxicated with her love the female companion lifted a piteous wail
then having seen the bird struck down by the fowler the pious sage valmiki was filled with compassion
having heard the wailing of the female bird the sage valmiki moved to pity at this irreligious act uttered the following words
o fowler since you have killed one of the pair of infatuated kraunchas you will be permanently deprived of your position
brooding over his utterances he reflected what is this that i uttered in reaction to the grief of this bird
very wise and learned he valmiki preeminent among sages pondered over it for a while and spoke these words to his disciple
occasioned by the griefstricken state of the bird and composed in rhymed lines each of equal number of syllables tuned to the accompaniment of stringed instruments let it be known as a sloka and not by any other name
his disciple delighted by the excellent verse composed by the sage committed it to memory which left his spiritual preceptor pleased
after having performed his ablution at that holy spot according to the prescribed ritual the sage valmiki returned to his hermitage pondering over the matter
then saint bharadwaja his disciple humble and learned in scriptures followed him with a pitcher full of water
valmiki who knows dharma entered the hermitage along with his disciple and sat in meditation and composed other stories
at that moment the effulgent fourfaced brahma creator and lord of the world himself desirous of seeing him valmiki the best among sages arrived
greatly surprised to see him valmiki purified by austerities and disciplined in speech immediately got up and with folded palms stood before him
bowing with reverence as enjoined by tradition and having enquired of his well being valmiki worshipped the immutable brahma by falling at his feet and welcoming him with a seat and water to wash his feet with
lord brahma sat down on a highly worshipful seat and showed a seat for the ascetic valmiki to be seated
having been ordered by brahma he also sat down on a seat although seated in the presence of the lord of the worlds he was absorbed in the thought of events leading to the death of the krauncha
the hunter killed the sweetvoiced krauncha without any cause that sinfulminded one with hostile feeling of capturing it had perpetrated this cruel act he thought
griefstricken valmiki having become introspective and lamenting the plight of the female krauncha again and again recited this sloka
thereafter lord brahma smilingly addressed valmiki the preeminent among sages saying you have indeed composed a slokathere is no doubt about it

having spoken these words lord brahma vanished at this he and his disciples were astonished
thereafter the disciples of valmiki chanted this sloka again and again in delight they were greatly astonished and spoke about it often
this sloka of four lines each consisting of equal number of syllables was recited by the maharshi constant recitation by others elicited admiration from the listeners

it was from the family of mighty monarchs with ikshvaku as its founder and the kings born in that race the celebrated epic known as the ramayanam arose
i shall propagate this ramayanam incorporating the merits of dharma artha and kama and complete in all respects it deserves to be heard right from the start without prejudice

the charioteer tells the king in privacy that he has heard the advice given by the offciating priests
o king the divine sanatkumara had narrated a story about your posterity in the presence of sages
kasyapa has a famous son named vibhandaka it was prophesied that he would have a son named rsyasringa
grown up in the forest and always moving with his father that sage knows none other than his father
o eminent king sage rsyasringa celebrated in the three worlds who practises a twofold brahmacharya life life of celebacy described by brahmins as vratitva and prajapatya
worshipping the firegod and attending on his renowned father he will spend a long time living in this manner practising vratitva mode of brahmacharya
at this time a powerful king romapada mighty and celebrated would be living in the country of anga
because of violation of code of conduct by the king a terrible dreadful drought frightening all living beings will set in the kingdom
with drought prevailing the griefstricken king would summon all those grown old with learning and tell them
those brahmins versed in the vedas said to o king bring here rsyasringa son of the sage vibhandaka by all means
o monarch on having brought rsyasringa here honour him and offer him your daughter santa with due reverence
on hearing their words the king in a thoughtful mood said how can the mighty sage be brought here
thereafter the confident king having decided in consultation with his ministers to bring him rsyasringa sent the priest with the counsellors on this mission
on hearing the kings words distressed and frightened by rishis power they appealed to the king faces bent down we will not go
after thinking about the means to be employed to bring the rishi to the court they told him they would bring the sage if they are not to blame in case anything untoward happens
thus with the help of courtesans of the king of anga when the son of the sage rsyasringa was brought rains followed the king offered his daughter santa in marriage to the sage
risyasringa your soninlaw would help you to obtain sons thus said sanathkumara which i have related to you
thereupon dasaratha pleased with him said to sumantra describe in detail the means by which rsyasringa was brought to the court of romapada      thus ends the ninth sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana of the first epic composed by sage valmiki
thus prompted by king dasaratha sumantra said i shall relate to you the manner in which rsyasringa was brought to the court listen to me along with your ministers
the priest accompanied by ministers said to romapada we have thought over a plan which will never fail
rsyasringa residing in the forest is engrossed in the study of the vedas he is not acquainted with women and sensual pleasures
by means of such things that can cause sensual pleasures and overpower the minds of men we shall be able to bring him to the town let it be decided quickly said the ministers
beautiful and welladorned courtesans may be sent there they will allure him by various means and honourably bring him here
the king having listened to these words conveyed his approval saying let it be done that way the priests and ministers acted accordingly
having heard this beautiful courtesans entered the great forest and remaining at a place not far from the hermitage made efforts to steal a sight of this son of a sage rsyasringa this forest dweller this controller of the senses
he rsyasringa was always content and never stirred out of his fathers hermitage absorbed in penance he had never seen a woman or a man nor any of the creatures born in towns or cities right from his birth
one day this son of vibhandaka rsyasringa accidentally came to the place where he saw the beautiful women
those wonderfully attired women singing with sweet voices approached the son of the sage rsyasringa and said
o brahman who are you how are you subsisting we wish to know why you are roaming alone in this dreadful forest could you tell us
he had never seen such charming women in the forest he developed affection towards them and a desire arose in him to speak about his father
my father is vibhandaka i am his own son my name is rsyasringa i am known the world over by this name associated with my karma
o auspiciouslooking women our hermitage is nearby i will extend to you due hospitality
after listening to the words of the sages son rsyasringa all the beautiful women with a desire to see the hermitage accompanied him
thereafter the son of ascetic respectfully received the the strangers saying accept our offerings here is water for washing feet and here are roots and fruits
the anxious courtesans received the offerings and afraid of the ascetics return made up their minds to withdraw immediately
o brahmin these are excellent fruits may prosperity be to you accept them and eat them without delay
then all the courtesans embracing him with joy offered plentiful sweetmeats and various items of food
the lustrous rsyasringa who had never tasted any food other than what was offered by the permanent forestdwellers mistook them for fruits
the ladies apprehensive of the arrival of his father took leave of him on the pretext of observance of evening rites
when they all departed kasyapas son the brahmin roamed rsyasringa with a restless mind charged with sorrow
on the following day the sage armed with the power of penance came to the place where he had seen those enticing welladorned courtesans
all of them were rejoiced on seeing the brahmin approaching them came nearer to him and said
o handsome one come to our hermitage a special sumptuous hospitality will be extended to you they said
having heard their words pleasing to the mind he agreed to go with them and the women took him away
as the illustrious sage was being brought to anga the god of rain parjanya suddenly inundated the earth which looked cherful with rain
the king romapada went out to welcome the ascetic the brahmin who brought along with him rains to his country he humbly bowed down his head and prostrated before him
he gave that indra among the brahmins offerings righteously with unstinted devotion and asked for his favour that he should not incur the wrath of the sage his father vibhandaka for having brought him to anga

on hearing his words and deeply thinking over the matter the prudent romapada agreed to send santas husband rsyasringa capable of blessing him with a son
the king relieved of his suffering was highly delighted he would take the brahmin with him and perform the sacrificial ritual
king dasaratha lord of the people and knower of dharma and truth desirous of performing the sacrifice would ask rsyasringa with folded palms for granting a boon to perform a sacrifice in order to obtain children and to attain heaven the king will get those desires fulfilled through that chief brahmin
four sons of immense prowess would be born to him bringing glory and fame to their dynasty they would be renowned in all the worlds
in early times of kritayuga this story was narrated by the holy and competent sanatkumara the great one among the devatas
greatest among men o king along with vehicles and retinue you may go and bring him rsyasringa personally with due respect
having heard the charioteers words and having obtained the consent of vasishta he along with his queens and courtiers departed to the place where the brahmin rsyasringa resided
crossing forests and rivers slowly the king reached the place where that foremost of ascetics lived
he reached the spot and saw the son of the ascetic the best of brahmins glowing like fire seated next to romapada
then the king romapada delighted at heart out of friendship with the king dasaratha offered special hospitality with respectful salutations in accordance with propriety

then king dasaratha took leave of his friend and set out he despatched swiftfooted messengers to the citizens with the command
let the entire city be welldecorated perfumed sprinkled with water and cleaned with flags hoisted
the people of the city having heard the kings arrival were overjoyed they did everything as by the king

after a long time at the advent of charming spring a desire arose in the mind of the king dasaratha to perform the sacrifice

you are an affectionate friend and most reverential spiritual guide to me the burden of performing the sacrifice which has since commenced shall be borne by you

in accordance with the ascetics order righteous sumantra himself quickly set out to escort janaka and other kings
all the workers reported to the wise sage vasishta about the tasks completed for the sacrifice
then well pleased the best among brahmins vasishta said to them all nobody should be offered any thing with disregard anything given with contempt undoubtedly results in the destruction of the donor
meanwhile kings from several countries to travelling nights and days arrived bringing with them various kinds of precious gifts

brahmins having tasted the delicious food cooked in prescribed manner praised saying ah we are fully satisfied prosperity to you such were the words heard by king dasaratha
while brahmins were being served with food by welldressed men some others wearing pendents studded with shining jewels assisted them
in the interval between ceremonies eloquent and sagacious brahmins were engaged in various disputations desirous of victory
every day in that sacrifice brahmins skilful in rituals persuaded by sage vasishta performed all their duties as per tradition
here in this sacrificial pavillion there was none who was not versed in six vedangas not true to vows not learned in many sastras nor adept in discussions on sastras
when the time came to erect sacrificial posts six posts each made of bilva and khadira wood and many made of parni wood along one of sleshmataka and two of devadaru wood with a distance of two outstretched hands between them were erected
all these posts were prepared by knowers of sastras and by those wellversed in the performance of sacrifices they were decorated with gold to add elegance to the sacrifice

decorated with flowers and sandal paste and covered with cloths stood the bright sacrificial posts shining like seven sages in the sky
the sacrificial fireplace was constructed with bricks with standard measurement by brahmins who were experts in the art of measuring land with a string or single strand
that sacrificial altar of the lion among kings dasaratha erected by welltrained brahmins was in the shape of the golden winged garuda it had three ranges and thrice as many fireplaces ie eighteen in number
animals serpents and birds were kept ready after the sastras intended for sacrifice for those respective deities
when the time came to sacrifice the animals the chief priests in accordance with tradition tied up the horse and all the aquatic animals to the sacrificial posts
three hundred animals and the jewel of the horses from the stables belonging to king dasaratha were bound to the sacrificial posts

hota adhvaryu and udgata arranged mahishi parivritti vavaata and another woman known as palakali to touch keep the company of the sacrificial horse
the official priest highly knowledgeable in scriptures and having restrained senses removed the marrow from the horse and cooked it according to tradition
the king at appropriate time and in agreement with the scriptures inhaled the odour of the smoke from the burnt marrow and absolved himself of his sins

the king best among men and upholder of his dynasty having concluded the sacrifice according to law offered this entire earth as gift to priests
but all the priests said to the king purged of his sins o lord of men you alone are capable of protecting this earth
o ruler of the earth we are constantly engaged in the study of the vedas we are not capable of ruling the earth and we cannot do anything with its possession give some other charity in lieu of that
o best of men give us gems or gold or cows or whichever is readily available we have no use with this earth
lord of men the king having been thus addressed by brahmins who were wellversed in the vedas bestowed on them ten hundred thousand cows a hundred crore of gold coins and four times as much in silver coins
all the priests collectively offered that wealth to sage rsyasringa and vasishta endowed with prudence
then those highly pleased brahmins having distributed that wealth with equity again said to the king
thereafter with earnestness king dasaratha bestowed a crore of gold coins to brahmins who had come to see the sacrifice
dasaratha then gave his excellent bracelet to a poor brahmin who solicited alms
when the brahmins were pleased king dasaratha who was fond of brahmins bowed to them with his eyes filled with delight
brahmins uttered blessings upon the generous king when he prostrated before them according to procedure
sacrifice destroys sins it leads to heaven it is incapable of being done by other monarchs king dasaratha was very much pleased after performing this great sacrifice
king dasaratha then addressing rsyasringa said o adherent of vows you can help the continuity of my race
rsyasringa the best of brahmins addressing the king said o king let it be four sons perpetuating your race will be born to you     thus ends the fourteenth sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
rsyasringa a highly intellectual and knowledgeable one in the vedas pondered for a while revived his memory and said to the king
i shall perform putriyeshti to help you beget sons this is to be done in accordance with tradition for fulfilment of desires through mantras as declared in a portion of the vedas atharva siras
to help dasaratha beget sons brilliant rsyasringa commenced putriyeshti a sacrifice for begetting children by pouring oblations into sacrificial fire and chanting mantras in accordance with traditions
all the celestial deities etc along with gandharvas according to tradition gathered at the sacrifice to receive their share of offerings
all devatas assembled there as per tradition and thus addressed lord brahma the creator of the worlds
o lord a rakshasa by name ravana who had obtained prowess through your grace is oppressing us we are unable to punish him
pleased with his penance lord you had granted him a boon by honour that boon and daily endure all his cruelty
the evilminded ravana is inflicting pains on the three worlds he hates the guardians of the earth and intends to assault indra lord of the celestials
because of your boon he has become unassailable and puffed with pride deties sages yakshas gandharvas demons and brahmins
the sun does not scorch him and the wind does not blow by him even the ocean with its incessantly moving waves becomes still in his presence
his dreamful appearance of that rakshasa strikes terror into us o lord do find some means to kill him
after listening to the words of the devatas and reflecting over the matter brahma said oh the means of destruction of that wicked rakshasa has struck my mind
when he asked gandharvas yakshas gods demons or rakshasas should never be able to kill him i said so be it
the rakshasa did not include man monkey and bear because of his disdain for men as such he is fit to be destroyed by a man and not by any other means
having heard these pleasing words uttered by brahma all the devatas and maharshis were overwhelmed with joy
at this juncture visnu the lord of the world highly effulgent and bearing conch discus and mace in his hands and in yellow apparel arrived
lord visnu stayed there with a composed mind after meeting brahma then thus spoke the devatas prostrated before visnu and paying him homage with hymns
o visnu we pray for the welfare of all the worlds the sovereign of ayodhya king dasaratha is a righteous virtuous and generous king equal with rishis in lusture pray form into four and incarnate in the of four sons of his three wives resembling hri modesty shree auspiciousness kirti fame
o visnu assuring human form kill ravana in the battle he has become a source of torment to the worlds and is invincible by gods
that stupid rakshasa ravana with his haughty prowess is terrorising the gods gandharvas siddhas and great rishis
it is reported that a cruel rakshasa with his haughty prowess has tortured rishis gandharvas and apsaras sporting in nandana groves
we siddhas gandharvas and yakshas along with ascetics have hence come here to devise ways of his death we take refuge in you
o tormentor of enemies o visnu you are the supreme refuge for all of us resolve to be born in the world of men for the destruction of enemies of the gods rakshasas
visnu the lord of the celestials foremost among the gods and bowed by all in the worlds addressed the assembled devatas who were guided by the law of righteousness and were led by the grand sire brahma
lord visnu supreme soul having given boon to devatas in this manner reflected as to the place where he should take birth as a man in this world of men
thereafter the lord with eyes like the lotus petal was pleased to transform himself into four forms and to choose king dasaratha as his father
then along with gandharvas groups of apsaras rishis rudras and devatas sang in praise of the lord slayer of madhu with hymns of celestial beauty
therefore uproot that mighty ravana possessing frightful prowess inflamed pride limitless insolence causing agony to the three worlds a source of vexation to ascetics and a dreadful enemy of indra
kill ravana the cause of distress in the worlds kill his forces and relatives them return to heaven protected by indra after freeing from distress faults and sins     thus ends the fifteenth sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
although omniscient lord narayana knew the means to be employed when he was requested by the best of devatas he spoke to them softly
what strategies should be adopted in the matter of destruction of that evilminded ravana who is a thorn to the sages
when the devatas were thus addressed by the imperishable visnu they replied him saying you may assume the form of a human being and slay ravana in the battle
o destroyer of foes lord brahma was very pleased with ravanas intense penance over a long time
pleased with the rakshasa brahma granted a boon to the effect that except from men there was for him no fear of death from any other living beings ravana ignored men while seeking the boon
having obtained the boon from brahma ravana greed and arrogant went on bringing destruction to the three worlds he carried away women by violence o destroyer of foes his death is possible by men only
having heard the words of devatas selfpossessed visnu chose king dasaratha as his father
at that time the brilliant king dasaratha destroyer of enemies who had no sons was performing a sacrifice for sons
after visnu had decided to incarnate and he was worshipped by devatas and maharshis he disappeared bidding farewell to brahma
during the sacrifice there emerged from the sacrificial fire a mighty being with unmatched splendour his prowess and strength he wore a black and crimson garment he had a red face his voice was similar to the sounds of a drum he had whiskers of soft and shining tawny hair resembling the mane of a lion he had fine hair on his head he was endowed with auspicious signs and adorned with splendid divine ornaments his height resembled a mountain peak he walked with the strides of a ferocious tiger similar to the sun in radiance he looked like the crest of a blazing fire this divine being held like his beloved wife both hands a large vessel made of gold purified in fire covered with a silver lid and filled with payasam a preparation of rice in milk and sugar it looked as though it was created by magic
having seen king dasaratha he said o king you know i have been sent by prjapati brahma and i am here
with folded palms the king replied o revered lord welcome to you what can i do for you
thereafter the one who came from prajapati answered o king you have obtained this payasam today in return for the worship offered to the devatas
o lion among kings receive this payasam prepared by gods conferring progeny bestowing affluence and improving health
o king you are performing this sacrifice for the sake of sons give this to your worthy consorts to consume it they will bear you sons
dasaratha was pleased to receive respectfully the golden vessel filled with the payasam prepared and bestowed by devatas
overwhelmed with great joy he walked around that wonderful being of pleasant countenance again and again and saluated him respectfully
dasaratha who received the payasam prepared by devatas was highly pleased like a poor man who received wealth
then that effulgent figure of wonderful form having given the bowl of payasam vanished from there
the inner apartment brightened with rays of happiness shone like the autumnal sky in the glow of the moon
he entered the inner apartment and addressing queen kausalya said receive this payasam which has the power to give you sons
then dasaratha gave half the portion of payasam to kausalya half of the remaining half to sumitra half of the remaining portion oneeighth of original to kaikeyi for the sake of a son on further thinking he gave the remaining oneeighth portion to sumitra in this manner the king divided and distributed the payasam among his wives separately
the virtuous wives of the king were exceedingly delighted and felt honoured after receiving the payasam
then the excellent consorts of the king who glowed like fire and the sun having consumed the choicest payasam became pregnant in a short time
the king now regained his composure of mind on seeing his pregnant wives he looked delighted like visnu worshipped by indra and hosts of siddhas and rishis     thus ends the sixteenth sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
when visnu had decided to be born as the son of that great king dasaratha the selfborn lord brahma addressed all devatas
create strong and powerful beings capable of assuming forms at free will to extend support to visnu who is true to his word heroic and benevolent
incarnate as monkeys in the womb of chiefs of apsarasas and gandharvas create sons who have the knowledge of deceitful tricks who are brave who match wind in speed who are endowed with intellect and statecraft who are determined who are knowledgeable in various means of achieving victory who are supernatural bodies who possess capability of employing and resisting weapons who resemble those who subsist on amrita immortals and are equal to visnu in prowess
earlier jambavan the foremost among bears was suddenly emerged out of my face while i was yawning
instructed by brahma in that manner all of them gave birth to sons in the form of monkeys
distinguished rishis siddhas vidhyadharas uragas charanas procreated in the form of monkeys heroic sons who became forestdwellers
indra gave birth to vali chief of monkeys resembling mahendra mountain and having a mighty body sun great among those producing heat begot sugriva
brihaspati begot the intelligent monkey tara who had none to surpass him among the monkey chiefs
kubera begot glorious gandhamadana and viswakarma begot a great monkey nala
neela the prosperous son of agni the firegod who equalled him in glow surpassed other monkeys in energy renown and prowess
aswini devatas endowed with wealth and beauty procreated mainda and dwivida who were highly esteemed for their beauty
varuna begot the monkey warrior sushena and parjanya sarabha of great strength
vayu the windgod begot a son named hanuman mighty and graceful having a body as hard as a diamond and speed equal to garudas
thousands of warriors possessing immeasurable strength and courage and capable of assuming any form at will were created to kill ravana
endowed with bodies similar to the meru and mandara mountains and having great strength bears monkeys monkeys with cowtails quickly came into being
the sons of devatas retained characteristics like beauty form and prowess of their procreator gods
some monkeys with acknowledged valour were born to female monkeys with tails similarly some other monkeys were born to female bears and female kinnaras
the devatas rishis gandharvas garudas yakshas kimpurushas siddhas vidyadharas uragas and many others were immensely pleased thousands of gigantic monkeys wandering in forests were procreated from principal apsarasas vidhyadaris nagas and gandharvas
they were endowed with the powers to assume any form at will they possessed enormous strength and power to freely wander in forests they were like lions and tigers in pride and prowess
they all could strike with rocks use nails and teeth and trees as weapons they were skilled in the use of all kinds of weapons
they could shake mountains and uproot deeprooted trees with their speed they could cause disturbance to samudra the lord of the rivers
they could cause cleavage to this earth with their feet cross the mighty ocean with one leap and enter the sky and even seize the clouds
they could capture wild elephants sojourning in the forest and make the flying birds drop down screaming
a crore of monkeys capable of assuming any form at will great monkeys and commanders of monkey forces were created
those monkey commanders created heroic monkeys among the chief monkey clans who later proved the best among clanleaders
thousands of monkeys dwelt on the plateaus on the top of mountains abounding in bears some others inhabited various hills and forests
all those leaders nala neela hanuman and others dwelt near those two brothers sugriva the offspring of surya and vali the son of indra
endowed with the might of garuda and wellversed in warfare all of them moving around tormented ferouious lions tigers and mighty serpents
mighty armed leader vali endowed with immense prowess protected with his strong arms all those bears gopuchhascowtailed and monkeys
born in many forms wih various characteristics relating to the body and tribe they pervaded this earth with its mountains forests and seas
in order to assist rama this earth was filled with commanders of those who led the monkey forces resembling masses of clouds and mountains they loan endowed with immense strength and fearful forms and countenances     thus ends the seventeenth sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
completed by the magnanimous king dasaratha the aswamedha and putreshti sacrifices the devatas received their share of havis and returned to their respective abodes
having completed the prescribed vows in respect of aswamedha king dasaratha together with his queens returned to the city of ayodhya accompanied by his attendants army and chariots
having been honoured by the king dasaratha in a be fitting manner the highly pleased lords of the earth kings made obeisance to the best of sages vasishta and returned to their own countries
when the army of the kings left the city ayodhya for their own the armed forces shone bright and cheerfl
after the departure of the rulers the exalted king dasaratha preceded by the foremost of brahmins entered the city of ayodhya
having been duly honoured by king dasaratha sage rsyasringa with his wife santa accompanied by the wise king romapada and his followers set out for his country
when they guests all departed in this manner dasaratha with his desire fulfilled his thought centred on begetting sons lived happily
six seasons one year passed after the completion of the sacrifice in the twelfth month of chaitra on the ninth day of the bright fortnight with aditi as presiding deity when the star punarvasu was in the ascendent and the five planets sun mars saturn jupiter and venus were exalted in their own house in karkata lagna when brihaspati was in conjunction with the moon kausalya gave birth to a son a facet of visnu lord of the entire universe who received obeisance from all the worlds and was adorned with all auspicious signs the venerable one to perpetuate the ikshvaku race

kausalya glowed with the undiminished lustre of her son just as aditi with her son indra the foremost among the gods and the wielder of thunder
as an incarnation of the fourth part of visnu imbued with all virtues and armed with truth bharata was born to kaikeyi
sumitra gave birth to lakshmana and satrughna who were heroic skilled in the use of all weapons and endowed with the facets of visnu
bharata endowed with pure intellect was born in meena lagna when pushya was in the ascendant lakshmana and satrughna were born in karkata lagna with the star aslesha
four worthy sons were successively born to the noble king dasaratha endowed with all virtuous resembling purvabhadra and uttarabhadra stars in brightness
the gandharvas sang melodiously groups of apsaras danced celestial kettledrums were sounded flowers were showered from the sky men througed to ayodhya to witness the festivities
the highways were crowded with men thronged by actors and dancers the voices of singers performers on different instruments eulogists and genealogists reverberated
the king distributed deserving gifts to priests euologists and genealogists he gave brahmins in charity thousands of cows and other valuables
after a lapse of eleven days the naming ceremony was performed highly delighted preceptor vasishta named kausalyas son rama kaikeyis son bharata one son of sumitra lakshmana and the other satrughna
brahmins as well as inhabitants of the city and rural areas were feasted dasaratha bestowed on brahmins unlimited and abundant jewels in charity the rites at the time of birth and all other rites associated with the newborn were duly performed
among them rama like the exalted flag became dear to his father like brahma he was highly respected by all living beings
all the sons of dasaratha became wellversed in the vedas they were heroic endowed with knowledge and virtues and were devoted to the welfare of the people
among them the highly lustrous and truly mighty rama was stainless in character he was auspicious to the entire world like the moon
accepted as skilled in mounting elephants riding horses driving chariots and also in archery he was always emgaged in the service of his parents
right from his very childhood lakshmana an enhancer of fortune always remained very attached to his eldest brother rama the delight of the world
lakshmana possessed of fortune was the dearest to his brother than his own body as though he was his life without
rama the greatest among men would not sleep without lakshmanas company he would not partake even the choicest food minus to him
whenever raghava rama went hunting into the forest riding the horse lakshmana used to follow him holding bow and arrows in his hand
in a similar manner satrughna younger brother of lakshmana became dearer than his own life to bharata similarly bharata also was dear to satrughna
with his very fortunate sons dasaratha was highly pleased like brahma was with the gods
all his sons were enriched with knowledge and endowed with all virtues they were modest renowned omniscient and farsighted dasaratha rejoiced at the sight of those glorious sons with such faculties and looked like brahma lord of the worlds
they like tigers among men were fond of the study of the vedas and were always engaged in the service of their parents they were also proficient in the science of archery
then the virtuous king dasaratha deliberated with his priests and kinsmen about the marriage of his sons
while the nobleminded king was thus deliberating in the midst of his counsellors there arrived the effulgent ascetic viswamitra
desirous of seeing the king dasaratha he accosted the doorkeepers saying inform the king quickly about the arrival of viswamitra the son of gadhi born in the line of kusika
on hearing those words of viswamitra all of them prompted by fear because of left for the royal apartment with excited minds and hurried steps
having reached the royal hall they reported to the king dasaratha descendant of the ikshvakus about the arrival of sage viswamitra
having heard their words dasaratha in great joy went forth together with his preceptors to receive him like indra receiving brahma
seeing viswamitra shining with the power of his penance fulfilled the king with a cheerful countenance made offerings with due respect
viswamitra received the offerings as ordained in the scriptures and enquired from the king about the welfare and prosperity of his kingdom
the exceedingly virtuous sage viswamitra enquired from the king about the treasury welfare of his subjects living in cities and villages and the well being of his friends and relatives
are the tributary kings submissive to you have you conquered your enemies are the rites for propitiating gods and the services to humanity performed rightly
the foremost of ascetis viswamitra approached vasishta and all other distinguised sages following the protocal and enquired about their welfare
all of them with gladdened hearts entered the royal palace and sat down in accordance with their position after having been duly honoured by the king
then the munificent king very much at viswamitras arrival pleased offered him a happy hospitality and spoke
o great sage welcome to you your arrival to me is like nectar to a human being rains to the parched land birth of a son to the childless through his worthy wife recovery of lost properity and festive joy in a great achievemnt
earlier you were rajarshi a warrior sage by your austerities you have obtained the brilliance that lends radiance even to the sun and the moon you have gained the status of a brahmrshi in several ways you are worthy of my worship
o brahman your arrival has caused surprise to me it has conferred great purity on me o lord by your very presence here i feel i haved acquired the merits of a pilgrimage
be pleased to tell me the purpose of your visit i desire to be given the privilege of doing service to achieve your object
o viswamitra you need not hesitatate to tell me what ought to be performed i shall accomplish that act in every possible special way you are a god to me
o brahmin i have attained this high foutune today my great merit has been realised as a result of your arrival
on hearing the words spoken in such an humble manner by the prudent king words pleasing to the mind and to the ears the great rishi of celebrated virtues and fame of sterling qualities experienced deep delight     thus ends the eighteenth sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
having heard these wonderful words of dasaratha the lion among kings the brilliant viswamitra with hair on end replied
o tiger among kings having been born on earth in an illustrious lineage and initiated by vasishta this way of speaking befits you it cannot be any other way
o tiger among kings i shall unfold the purpose conceived in my mind take a decision and be truthful to your promise
o best among men for the successful completion of a sacrifice i took up a selfimposed religious observance two rakshasas capable of assuming forms at will are creating impediments to that sacrifice
when my sacrifice generally speaking is nearing completion the powerful and welltrained maricha and subahu who are raining streams of blood and flesh upon the altar
the solemn vow for observance of religious rites being thus interrupted i left that country as an exerted and discouraged man
o king my mind does not permit me to vent my wrath the nature of sacrifice is such that i refrain from cursing them
o tiger among kings it is befitting of you to entrust your eldest son rama to me who is valiant young having sidelocks of hair and true to his prowess
protected by me and by his own divine power rama is capable of destroying even those demons causing impediments to the sacrifice
i will confer upon him without doubt a lot of blessings for his wellbeing by which he will attain fame in all the three worlds
both of them maricha and subahu will not be able to withstand rama in any way rama and rama alone is capable of destroying them
proud of their strength the two wicked demons have been noosed by yama the god of death o tiger among kings they are no match for the magnanimous rama
o king it is not proper for you to hesitate because of your paternal affection you need to know that both the rakshasas will perish this i assure you
i know rama who is a great soul true to his prowess and also vasishta of great lustre and these other sages who have been steadfast in asceticism also know
o king of kings if you are seeking the benefits of righteousness great everlasting fame in this world it is fit and proper to give rama to me
o kakustha if your counsellors and all other sages headed by vasishta give their consent then only you may relieve rama
you should spare your dear son the lotuseyed rama impartial and detached for ten nights
o dasaratha descendant of raghu act in such a manner that the time for my sacrifice is not delayed do not indulge in grief prosperity to you
after speaking these words charged with dharma and artha the great sage resplendent viswamitra fell silent
having listened to those auspicious words of viswamitra the king among kings dasaratha experienced intense grief out of fear he became despondent
the great king felt shaken off his throne after listening to the words of the sage viswamitra which broke his heart and terribly upset his mind     thus ends the nineteenth sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
on hearing viswamitra words the tiger among kings dasaratha lost his senses for a moment and on regaining his consciousness spoke this way
my lotuseyed son rama is less than sixteen i do not think he has ability to fight with the rakshasas in a battle
here is the whole akshauhini army of which i am the lord and sustainer accompanied by the akshauhini i shall engage those rakshsasas in the battle
these servants of mine are warriors valiant powerful and courageous skilled in the use of weapons and fit to engage multitude of rakshasas in battle it is not proper to take rama with you
wielding bow in hand i will protect the sacrifice as long as my life sustains i will engage the rakshasas in the battle
i shall go there protect the sacrifice and see that it is conducted without obstacles it is not proper to take rama with you
rama is still a child he is not learned in the science of warfarehe does not know the strength and weakness of enemies he has not acquired as yet the strength of using weapons and is not proficient in warfare you know certainly those rakshasas are deceitful in battle and hence he is not qualified to oppose them in the battle succesfully
separated from rama i do not like to live even for a moment o tiger among ascetics it is not proper to take rama with you
o sage of great vows o brahman if at all you intend to take rama with you take me also along with my army
o scion of of kusika family sixty thousand years have passed since i was born rama was born to me after a great deal of suffering it is not proper to take him with you
my love for rama among all my four sons is supremeit is not proper for you to take rama the eldest son whose prime qualification is his virtue
o best of sages how powerful are those rakshsas whose sons are they who are they and how huge is their body who are protecting them
o brahman how to rebuff those deceitful warriors either through rama or through my army or through me
o venerable one how to fight those wickednatured ones in the battle and stay aginst them for rakshasas are proud of their prowess having heard the words of dasaratha viswamitra said
ravana king of rakshasas is the brother of kubera and son of ascetic visravana he is said to possess great prowess
although endowed with great strength ravana by himself never created impediments to the sacrifice but two rakshasas by name maricha and subahu are incited by him to cause obstacles
informed in this manner by sage viswamitra king dasaratha addressed the sage saying i am not competent enough to stand before those evilminded rakshasas in the batlle
you are the knower of righteousness extend your favour to my little son and also to me for i am so who is unfortunate you are verily my spiritual preceptor and god
gods danavas gandharvas yakshas birds and great serpents cannot withstand ravana in battle what are men to him they are no match to him
that rakshasa pulls out warriors prowess in the battle o foremost of ascetics either with forces or with my sons it is not possible for me to engage him or his forces in battle
o brahman although my son resembles the celestials he is not experienced in warfare on no account shall i spare him
further the sons of sunda and upasunda by name maricha and subahu are causing obstacles to your sacrifice they resemble the god of death yama i shall never part with my son
maricha and subahu not only possess prowess but also are experienced in warfare together with my group of friends i can combat with one of the two
having heard the statements of the king the son of kusika viswamitra who was like indra among the ascetics was seized by great anger as though fire in the form of maharshi blazed like the sacrificial fire into which oblations of clarified butter have been poured  i ph e ne ehb mity rmadra vmkya iky bak viassargathus ends the twentieth sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
out of affection towards his son his king dasarathas plea to viswamitra was full of contradiction and on hearing the king enraged viswamitra replied
o king if this act of yours is appropriate to you i will go back to the places where from i came o scion of the race of kakutstha you have proved false to your promise live happily with your relatives
at the sight of the wise sage viswamitra seized of wrath the entire earth shook and devatas were gripped in fear
great vasishta an adherent of ascetic practices and steadfast to duty seeing that the entire world frightened addressed the king saying
born in the line of ikshvaku you are a veritable the second god of righteousness firm adherent of vows auspicious and virtuous it is not right on your part to abandon your promise
o dasaratha you are reputed in the three worlds as righteousminded do your own duty do not follow an unjust act which is unworthy of respect
o dasaratha a promise made and not kept amounts to destruction of merits earned through previous pieties therefore send rama with him
trained or not in the use of arms as long as rama is protected by viswamitra just as nectar is protected by the flaming firegod rakshasas will not be able to compete with him
this viswamitra is an embodiment of righteousness and unsurpassed among the powerful none can excel him in intellect in this world he is the supreme refuge in austerity
this viswamitra knows the use of various kinds of weapons which no one knows among the animate and the inanimate in the three worlds nor will any one even know in future
no gods nor sages nor asuras in rakshasas nor kinnaras nor mighty serpents nor gandharvas nor the best of yakshas will be able to know
all these weapons were given to viswamitra by bhrisasvas highly virtuous sons while he was ruling the kingdom
grandsons daughters sons of prajapati they these weapons are in diverse forms highly energetic and full of glory they bring victory
jaya and suprabha of slender waists are the two daughters of daksha they gave birth to one hundred effulgent sons known as astras and shastras
formerly jaya for the destruction of the army of asuras gave birth to fifty sons by virtue of a boon they possess immeasurable power of changing forms at will
suprabha gave birth to another fifty sons named samharas who are unassailable invincible and more powerful
viswamitra is well conversant with these weapons being virtuous he is capable of creating new weapons also
such is the prowess of viswamitra who is a highly effulgent and highly renowned sage o king in sending rama you need not entertain any doubt
son of kusika even though capable of repressing those rakhsasas by himself it is for the welfare of your son that he is here requesting you to spare him
satisfied in his mind at the words of the sage vasishta the full one among the raghus dasaratha one with wide reputation his frame shining gave his cheerful consent to the son of kusika for ramas departure     thus ends the twentyfirst sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
vasishta having said thus king dasaratha with cheerful countenance summoned rama and lakshmana
rama was given farewell by his parents with recitation of mantras for securing prosperity and averting evils priest vasishta sanctified him with mantras dasaratha kissed his son on the forehead and delivered him to the care of viswamitra with a heart full of cheer
at the sight of the lotuseyed rama accompanying viswamitra the wind blew pollenfree with a gentle touch
the departure of glorious viswamitra was greeted with incessant showers of flowers the beating of celestial drums and the blowing of conches
viswamitra walked in the forefront behind him was rama bow in hand while in the archer sumitras son lakshmana with side locks of hair followed
rama and lakshmana equipped with bows and quivers resembled three hooded serpents warriors of no less prowess they illuminated the ten quarters and followed the high souled viswamitra like twin aswanikumaras following the grandsire brahma
then bows in hand wellattired their fingers encased in mongrel skin for protection against the bowstring armed with scimitars resplendent young handsome the two brothers rama and lakshmana shone unblemished as they followed sage viswamitra spreading radiance they looked like sons of the god of fire skanda and visakhu following the incomprehensible siva
then bows in hand wellattired their fingers encased in mongrel skin for protection against the bowstring armed with scimitars resplendent young handsome the two brothers rama and lakshmana shone unblemished as they followed sage viswamitra spreading radiance they looked like sons of the god of fire skanda and visakhu following the incomprehensible siva
after crossing a distance of over half a yojana on the southern bank of sarayu viswamitra addressed rama sweet in a gentle voice
o child take this water in your hands let there be no delay you will receive from me a collection of mantras and also bala and atibala
if you receive these mantras you will experience neither fatigue nor fever nor will there be a change in your appearance whether you are asleep or agitated rakshasas cannot harm you
o rama there is none in this world equal to the might of your hands nor does such a person exist in the three worlds
o sinless one there is none in this world equal to you in good fortune kindness wisdom in taking a decsion or giving a reply
with these two kinds of knowledge secured there will be none equal to you at present or in fututre bala and atibala are mother to all kinds of knowledge
o rama best among men scion in the line of raghu on your way you will not feel hunger or thirst if you recite bala and atibala
o rama born in the line kakutstha and one who is righteous these two radiant sciences are daughters of the grandsire brahma if you pursue these two sciences you will get unequalled fame you are a fit person to confer these two sciences
you possess all these qualities in great measure there is no doubt that if these two sciences mantras are nourished with austerities they will assume multiple forms and benefit you
thereafter rama touched the water and was sanctified with a cheerful face he received those two sciences from the maharshi who had perceived the supreme soul
rama the highly heroic after acquiring knowledge of the two sciences and having rendered all services to preceptor viswamitra appeared resplendent like the sungod in autumn there the three of them spent the night comfortably on the bank of sarayu
the night was spent as though with comfort by the two eminent sons of dasaratha who shared the unaccustomed bed of grass they were kept in good humour by the words of kusikas son     thus ends the twentysecond sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
when the night turned into daybreak the eminent ascetic viswamitra addressing the descendants of kakutstha rama and lakshmana who were lying on a bed of leaves said
o beloved son of kausalya o rama the day dawns o best among men awake oblations to gods and other sacred rites are required to be performed
on hearing the very affectionate call of viswamitra both the brave princes had their bath and offered oblations to sungod standing in the water and recited the holy name of the lord
on performing the morning rites the two highly powerful and and energetic princes stood before viswamitra who was richly endowed with asceticism they prostrated before him and stood ready for their onward journey
thereafter having gone a little further both the heroic brothers looked at the confluence of holy sarayu with divine ganga divided into three branches
there they saw a sacred hermitage of anchorites of great vitality performing severe austerities for thousands of years
exceedingly delighted to see the sacred hermitage the two princes enquired from the illustrious sage viswamitra
o worshipful one whose sacred hermitage is this who lives here indeed we are curious to know
on having heard their words the foremost of sages gently smiled and said o rama listen who this hermitage belonged to in the past
kandarpa the god of love once lived here in human form he is called kama by the learned the wicked kama on his way with the maruts god of wind insulted siva the god of gods while he was absorbed in austere meditation along with his newly wedded consort on seeing kama lord siva roared at him menacingly
o descendant of raghu burnt down by his fierce third eye all the limbs of the body of that evilminded kama were consumed
having been completely burnt down by lord siva kamas body was destroyed mighty angry siva reduced kama to a disembodied being
o descendant of the raghus from that time onwards he was known as ananga one without form the beautiful place where he gave up his body is known as angadesa
this holy hermitage belongs to kama these ascetics are his disciples they are always righteous and are free from sin
o auspiciouslooking rama we will stay here tonight at the confluence of both these sacred rivers sarayu and ganga and cross over ganga tomorrow
o best of men after morning ablutions offering oblations to the sacred fire all of us sanctified will enter this pious hermitage
as they were conversing thus the ascetics with their far reaching spiritual vision beyond the veil of time recognised them and were immensely pleased
after extending hospitality to the son of kusika viswamitra with respectful offerings and water for washing feet they played the host to rama and lakshmana
having received due hospitality they delighted them ascetics with their talk the rishis with composed minds recited their evening prayer as usual
the ascetics who resided there faithful to their vows took them in there they staed happily in kamas hermitage
foremost among the ascetics the son of kusika viswamitra delighted the charming princes with enchanting tales      thus ends the twentythird sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
thereafter the destroyers of foes rama and lakshmana offering their morning oblations on that bright dawn arrived at the bank of the river ganga with viswamitra ahead of them
all the highminded ascetics and strict followers of vows secured an auspicious boat for them and addressed viswamitra saying
with the princes ahead of you board the boat tread the safe path let there be no loss of time
be it so said viswamitra and paid respect to all those sages and accompanied by them rama and lakshmana crossed the river flowing towards the sea
as they reached the midstream rama and his younger brother heard a sound greatly augmented by the speed of the river
rama enquired of viswamitra the best of sages what is this tumultuous sound bursting out of the waters
at the words of rama filled with curiosity the righteous viswamitra narrated the true nature of that sound
o tiger among men rama brahma created out of his mind a lake on mount kailas and so that lake is called manasa sarovara
this river which flows from manasa sarovara is therefore known as sarayu it surrounds ayodhya this sacred river flows from that lake of brahma
when ganga approaches this river sarayu there is a clash of waters and this great noise is produced rama offer respectful salutations here with a calm mind
deeply religious in nature they both made obeisance to the two rivers and reached the southern bank and advanced with quick steps
he who was a descendent of ikshvaku and son of the best of kings dasaratha having seen that untrodden and dreadful forest asked the foremost of the ascetics
what a wonder this inaccessible forest echoes with the shrill chirpings of crickets it is filled with ferocious beasts and birds producing fearful sounds
it resounds with the frightful shricks of various kinds of birds lions tigers boars and elephants prowl about
this forest jampacked with dhava ashvakarna kakubha bilva tinduka patala and badari trees how frightening this forest could be
viswamitra the great sage radiating energy addressing rama said o child of kakusthsa dynasty i shall tell you whose dreadful forest this is listen
o best among men formerly these two large and prosperous cities called malada and karusha built by celestial architects existed
o rama in ancient times after killing vritrasura indra was overpowered by the sin of slaying a brahmin and was affected by impurity and hunger
devas and rishis endowed with the wealth of asceticism bathed indra with the consecrated waters brought from all rivers from the pitchers and got him cleansed of impurities
with the hunger and the taint and impurity from the body of mahendra removed at this place the devas rejoiced
cleansed of his impurities and his hunger gone indra once again became pure allpowerful indra highly pleased gave an excellent boon to that region
indra blessed the place saying having absorbed impurities of my body let these places be extremely fertile and prosperous and let this be renowned throughout this world as malada and karusha
having seen the honour bestowed on that land by the wise indra the gods said to him well done well done
o destroyers of enemies these prosperous townships malada and karusha looked cheerful with bumper crops and wealth for a long time
then after a lapse of several years o gentle one a terrible yakshini by name tataka wife of intelligent sunda capable of assuming different forms at will possessed of the strength of a thousand elephants and mother of a rakshasa known as maricha armed with the power of indra took possession of this place
the arms of maricha are round and strong he is highly energetic he has a large face and a huge body in appearance he is gigantic and possesses a dreadful form that rakshasa always threatened the inhabitants
o rama that wicked than tataka carried on her depredations at regular intervals in these locations malada and karusha
tataka lives at a distance of one and a half yojanas from here obstructing the path since tataka dwells in this forest no one comes here because of fears
by the strength of your arms slay this one of wicked deeds comply with my orders and make this country safe and habitable
o rama none dare approach this country ravaged by such dreadful intolerable yakshini
you have been told the manner in which this fierce forest is entirely ruined by that cruel yakshini tell now she has not left this place     thus ends the twentyfourth sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
on hearing the excellent words of viswamitra a sage with unimaginable faculty rama the tiger among men rama replied in a gentle voice
o best of ascetics i have heard the yakshas possess little prowess how can a woman who is by gender weak possess the strength of a thousand elephants
viswamitra said listen how she acquired the prowess and strength by virtue of a boon she received
in the past there was a powerful and great yaksha by name suketu he had no children so he performed an intense penance following virtuous practices
rama the grandsire brahma was highly gratified and granted to the king of yakshas the gem of a daughter by name known astataka
the illustrious grandsire brahma granted her the strength of a thousand elephants but did not bestow a son on the yaksha
as she grew up glowing with youth and beauty she was given in marriage to sunda son of jharjha
after some time that yakshini gave birth to an unassailable son by name maricha because of a curse he became a rakshasa though born of yaksha parentage
o rama when sunda died tataka along with her son wanted to attack agastya the best of sages
roaring she rushed with excitement to devour him the venerable rishi agastya saw her approaching him and cursed maricha to assume form of a demoness
mighty angry agastya cursed tataka saying abandon this form of a great yakshini and assume the terrible figure of a rakshasi a cannibal with distorted appearance and a hideous countenance
enraged at the curse senseless tataka with anger has been ravaging this sacred land when agastya walked
o rama for the welfare of cows and brahmins slay this yakshini who is wicked extremely cruel and possessing vile prowess
o son of raghus dynasty she is maligned by the curse and so not a single man in the three worlds except you is competent to slay this yakshini
o best among men you need not hate killing a woman you are a prince you should serve the interest of the four orders of the society
whether cruel or kind sinful or wrong whatever contributes to the protection of the subjects should be done by the righteous king
this is the eternal law binding those who are appointed to bear the burden of a kingdom o kakutstha kill her she knows no dharma
o prince it is heard that in the past indra slew manthara virochanas daughter who intended to destroy the earth
o rama in olden times the mother of kavya and the wife of sage bhrigu determined to make this world devoid of indra was destroyed by visnu
o prince by these magnanimous persons and by great men several unrighteous women were killed for the common good     thus ends the twentyfifth sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
after listening to the manly command of ascetic viswamitra rama of the lineage of raghu the son of the foremost of men and firm in determination replied with folded palms
in ayodhya in the presence of elders and spiritual masters of dasarathas court i have been ordered by my magnanimous father to act according to your instructions and his words cannot be disobeyed
as per the words of my father and the command of viswamitra who has the knowledge of the brahman i shall execute the welcome act of killing tataka
for the welfare of cows and brahmins and also for the good of this country i am ready to perform such acts as commanded by you of boundless energy
rama the destroyer of enemies having said so clinched the middle of the bow with his fist and filled the ten quarters with the resounding twanging of the bowstring
the dwellers of the tataka forest were terrified by the sound of the bow tataka was might angry and amazed
hearing that sound the demoness thought for a while and senseless with anger rushed in the direction where the sound had come from
filled with wrath rama saw tataka disfigured with a distorted face and gigantic in size turning to lakshmana he said
o lakshmana behold the sight of the dreadful hideous body of this yakshini will break timid hearts
see she is unassailable because of the strength gained through black magic i shall cut off her ears and the tip of her nose and make her turn away
by virtue of being a woman she is protected i am not inclined to slay her but take away her prowess and power of motion
while rama was still speaking tataka incensed with fury rushed with her uplifted arms towards him roaring
brahmarshi viswamitra threatened her with hunkara menacing sound uttering auspices to the raghavas rama and lakshmana be aupicousness and success victorious
tataka raising a cloud of frightening dust left the descendants of raghu bewildered quite for a moment
then invoking the power of magic she showered extensive rain of boulders on both the descendants of raghu rama was enraged at this
rama retaliated that mighty rain of rocks with a volley of arrows while she was advancing towards him he cut off her hands
when she was tired and roaring in a nearby place with her hands chopped off lakshmana cut off her ears and the tip of her nose in indignation
capable of assuming forms at will that yakshini intending to delude the princes through her power of magic vanished from the sight she then assumed various forms and released a rain of rocks and started moving about frightfully
on seeing them hit and thrown about by a rain of stones from all sides the auspicious son of gadhi viswamitra spoke these words
o rama she does not deserve any more compassion this yakshini who is sinful wicked and obstructor of sacrifice will regain her strength by her magical powers
kill her for dusk is fast approaching during evening the strength of rakshasas tends to increase and they become unassailable
addressed thus by viswamitra rama attacked her exhibiting his skill in targetting her by the sound and prevented with arrows the yakshini from showering stones
prevented by a multitude of arrows she with her magical powers advanced towards rama and lakshmanaroaring
her chest pierced with an arrow she rushing menacingly towards them like a thunderbolt fell down dead
having seen the slain yakshini of terrible appearance indra and other celestials worshipped rama exclaiming well done well done
then exceedingly pleased the thousandeyed indra and all other delighted celestials said to viswamitra
o ascetic kausika may prosperity be to you all devatas have been gratified by this act of rama and have expressed their love for rama
o brahmarshi you may offer to rama the sons of prajapati brishasva who are the weapons bestowed with the power that comes from truth and ascetic energy
o brahmarshi following you with firmness of mind rama is worthy to receive the weapons he who is a prince has to accomplish many such great tasks for the benefit of the celestials
having said these words the celestials were pleased they honoured viswamitra and returned to their abodes from where they had come and then dusk set in
then the best of ascetics viswamitra rejoiced over the death of tataka kissed the forehead of rama fondly and spoke these words
o auspiciouslooking rama tonight we shall stay here tomorrow morning we proceed to my hermitage
having heard the words of viswamitra rama rejoiced and rested happily that night in the tataka forest
freed from the curse from that day that forest looked charming and shone like chitraratha kuberas garden
rama having killed the daughter of yaksha was praised by multitudes of devatas and siddhas he stayed in the same forest with the sage at the first glimpse of dawn he was awakened by the sage viswamitra     thus ends the twentysixth sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
the night over illustrious viswamitra called rama with a sweet smile
o prince of great renown i am extremely pleased may you prosper out of great love and affection for you i shall make over all the weapons
with the help of these celestial weapons you will vanquish even gods and demons serpents together with gandharvas if they challenge you to a battle as enemies and take them as captives i shall confer on you all such weapons may you prosper

o mightyarmed prince i shall grant mahaastra vaidyadhara and and an excellent scimitar known as nandana
rama i shall grant two much favoured weapons namely gandharvaastras manava astra which induce and suppress sleep and sauraastra as well

o rama mightyarmed prince receive these mighty and highly exalted astras capable of assuming at once any form at will
viswamitra the greatest ascetic after the purification ritual stood with his face turned east and happily conferred on rama collection of the unique mantras
the sage offered rama the complete collection of those weapons which even the celestials find it difficult to acquire
while the sagacious ascetic viswamitra was muttering the mystic terms of these venerable astras addressing their respective deities all these weapons with their mystic power attended on rama
the munificient presiding deities of the weapons with folded palms addressed these words to rama saying here we are at you disposal
rama received the astras he felt with his hands and commanded them saying live in my mind serve me whenever i remember you
thereafter the cheerful rama bowed to the mighty ascetic viswamitra and commenced his journey     thus ends the twentyseventh sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
after performing the purificatory rites rama received the weapons with a cheerful face in the way rama said to viswamitra
o venerable one having received these weaponsi have become unassailable even by the celestials o best of ascetics may i know the way to withdraw these weapons
to these words spoken by rama maharshi viswamitra who was patient practitioner of vows and pure taught the withdrawl mantra
o rama the descendant of raghu receive from me the effulgent weapons who are the sons of bhrusasva and who are capable of changing forms at will they are satyavanta satyakirti dhrishta rabhasa pratiharatara paranmukha turned back wards avanmukha turned downwards lakshaksha vishama drudhanabha and sunabha dasaksha satavaktra dasasheersha and satodara padamanabha and mahanabha dundunabha and sunabhaka jyotisha krusanam both nairasya and vimala yogandhara haridradaitya prasamana sarchirmali dhri mali vrtiimanta also ruchira pitrusaumanasa bothvidhuta makara karaveera kara dhana dhanya kama roopa kamaruchi moha also avarana jrumbhaka sarvanabha also santhana and varuna you are worthy of receiving these weapons may you prosper
o rama the descendant of raghu receive from me the effulgent weapons who are the sons of bhrusasva and who are capable of changing forms at will they are satyavanta satyakirti dhrishta rabhasa pratiharatara paranmukha turned back wards avanmukha turned downwards lakshaksha vishama drudhanabha and sunabha dasaksha satavaktra dasasheersha and satodara padamanabha and mahanabha dundunabha and sunabhaka jyotisha krusanam both nairasya and vimala yogandhara haridradaitya prasamana sarchirmali dhri mali vrtiimanta also ruchira pitrusaumanasa bothvidhuta makara karaveera kara dhana dhanya kama roopa kamaruchi moha also avarana jrumbhaka sarvanabha also santhana and varuna you are worthy of receiving these weapons may you prosper
certainly said rama and with a delighted heart received the astras some of the astra devatas were coat black some like smoke some resembled rays of sun or moon assuming corporal forms with shining divine bodies those weapons the their bodies bent down and palms folder they spoke to rama in a gentle voice o tiger among men here we are what can we do for you
rama spoke to them astra devatas saying reside in my mind and render assistance in times of need now you can go according to your will
thereafter those devatas having said be it so circumambulated rama took leave of him and returned to their respective abodes from where they had come
after having acquired the knowledge of the weapons rama addressed maharshi viswamitra in gentle and soft words while walking along with him
from this side of the mountain not faroff from here stand shining and goodlooking trees resembling clouds it is replete scattered with animals pleasing to the mind and extremely beautiful it is adorned with various kinds of birds singing sweetly what could be this i am very curious to know
o best of acetics i think we have come out of that awesome horripilating forest because of the pleasant feeling experienced in this region whose hermitage is this o revered one tell me
o great ascetic o venerable brahmana from where do those slayers of brahmanas doers of cruel acts wickedminded and sinful persons come from and cause obstacles to your sacrifice where is that sacrificial place required to be protected by me where are these rakshasas required to be slain o best of ascetics i would like to hear from you      thus ends the twentyeighth sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
the highly lustrous viswamitra heard the words of rama of immeasurable prowess on his ramas query about the forest viswamitra explains
o mightyarmed rama lord visnu the foremost among the gods and master the great ascetic lived here carrying out yogic practices and penance for innumerable years constituting hundreds of yugas
o rama this was the hermitage of glorious vamana the great sage her performed his ascetic pratices here hence it is known as siddhashrama
during the period visnu in the incarnation of vamana was observing austerities at this hermitage king bali son of virochana having vanquished indra and maruts and devatas ruled this kingdom and became famous in all the three worlds for his prowess and generosity
while bali was performing the sacrifice to confirm his position as lord of the three worlds the devas got together with agni in the forefront and approached lord visnu at this hermitage saying
o visnu son of virochana is performing a great sacrifice before its completion our purpose ought to be achieved
he is granting the seekers whatever wherever and in whichever maner they coming from here and there approach him for favour
o visnu perform this supreme auspicious act assuming the form of a dwarf through the power of illusion for the welfare of the devatas
o rama in the mean time revered kasyapa resplendent like the god of fire radiating lustre with aditi who had completed a thousand divine years of austerities pleased with her penance the conferer of boons lord madhusudana visnu and she said to visnu
you are all ascetism a mass of tapas and an embodiment of tapas your soul is tapas o purushottama i am beholding you after a rigorous penance
o lord i am beholding this entire universe in your body you are beginningless and indescribable i take refuge in you
addressing kasyapa whose sins had been washed clean lord visnu pleased with his penance said be prosperous you are dear to me worthy of a boon ask
having heard those words of vishnu kasyapa son of maricha replied o bestower of boons o great practitioner of austerities be pleased to grant a boon for aditi devatas and for myself
o sinless lord be born son to aditi and to me o destroyer of asuras be the younger brother to indra you can help these sorrowstricken devatas
o lord of the celestials with my penance accomplished here this place will be known as siddhaashrama by your grace o lord arise from here
then the resplendent visnu born from the womb of aditi and assuming the form of vamana approached the son of virochana bali
thereafter visnu soul of the universe who restores respect for the righeous and renders the welfare of all living beings having begged from bali and been granted three places to put his footsteps on occupied the three worlds and by restraining bali with his energy gave it back to mahendra in this manner the highly lustrous visnu gave possession of the three worlds to mahendra
this asrama which relieves fatigue previously under the possession of vamana has come under my occoupation for my devotion to him
o tiger among men wicked rakshasas who prowl about the asram and cause obstacles ought to be killed here only
o rama now lets go to the unparalleled siddhashrama o child this asrama is the same to you as it is to me treat this as your own
while enetering the hermitage the great ascetic appeared resplendent in the company of rama and lakshmana like the moon in conjunction with punarvasu star emerging out of the mist
at the sight of viswamitra all the ascetics inmates of siddhashrama jumped out instantly and offered him their worship
they extended hospitality to both the princes in the same way they offered their worship to the sagacious viswamitra
the two princes of the lineage of raghu destroyers of foes rested a while and then said to viswamitra a tiger amon sages
o foremost of ascetics get initialed today you will prosper and this asram will attain its fulfilment your words shall come true
saying this viswamitra the great saint effulgent and self trained engaged himself in the initiation ceremony
the two princes spent the right comfortably and woke up at daybreak they performed morning in accordance with the prescribed rule ablutions said their prayers and paid their respects to viswamitra seated at the kindled firesacrifice     thus ends the twentyninth sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
thus spoke the two princes to viswamitra they were conscious of place and time to speak and capable of conquering enemies
o adorable brahmarshi we want to know around what time the rakshasas will make their appearance so that the sacrifice can be protected let not that moment pass
the sages of the asrama were very pleased they extolled the princes of kakustha dynasty who were eager to fight the rakshasas
o sons of raghus lineage protect the sacrifice for six nights from today with the ceremoney initiated the sage would observe silence said the inmates
at these words of the sages the illustrious princes got ready to protect the tapovana for six days and six nights without sleep
the two mighty heroic archers rama and lakshmana destroyers of enemies attended upon the sacrifice in order to protect sage viswamitra
time passed when the sixth day arrived rama cautioned lakshmana to be vigilant
while he was fracing up for a fight the fire on the sacrificial altar with the officiating priests and spiritual guides suddenly brightened
the altar with viswamitra and the officiating priests kusa grass ladles and square vessels bundles of sticks and flowers used in the sacrificfial fire got brightened up
while the sacrifice was being performed in accordance with mantras a great sound causing fear emerged from the sky
like the clouds in the rainy season the two rakshasas maricha and subahu covering the sky through their power of illusion came running to the sacrificial place
maricha and subahu of fearful appearance arrived with their followers and rained streams of blood on the sacrificial altar
flames rose on the sacrificial altar drenched by the stream of blood immediately rama rushed forward and beheld them in the sky
having seen them maricha and subahu suddenly advancing the lotuseyed rama gazed at lakshmana and said
o lakshmana behold by manavaastra i shall chase like clouds scattered by winds those wicked rakshasas who eat human flesh
the inflamed rama hurled the highly powerful and effulgent manavaastra on the chest of maricha
smitten by that powerful manavaastra maricha was thrown to a full distance of hundred yojanas into the surging high seas
having seen maricha beaten by the power of that coolarrowed astra thrown to a distance reeling and lying unconscious rama spoke to lakshmana
o lakshmana behold this manavaastra associated with righteousness employing a cool arrow which carries him away by making him unconscious and yet not taking his life
i shall slay these merciless wicked doors of sinful acts destroyers of sacrifices and blood rakshasas
then rama took hold of the celestial marvellous agneya weapon and hurled it into the chest of subahu struck subahuhe fell down on the ground
illustrious and highly generous rama killed the remaining rakshasas with the vayavya weapon to the delight of the ascetics
having killed the rakshasas obstructors of sacrifices rama was worshipped by the hermits like indra was honoured in the past when he was victorious
thereafter when the sacrifice was completed maharshi viswamitra beholding all the directions bereft of evils said to rama
there with their purpose fulfilled the heroes rama and lakshmana full of joy in their hearts spent the night
as the night dawned both the brothers performed the morning rites and approached viswamitra and other rishis
sweettongued they visited with folded hands the best of ascetics viswamitra who was shining like a flaming fire and addressed him thus in sweet and generous words
o tiger among ascetics we two are at your service command whatever you want and we shall execute it
addressed thus by both of them viswamitra ahead of all the sages spoke to rama
o foremost of men janaka king of mithila is performing a great religious sacrifice we shall go there
o tiger among men come along with us you ought to see there the wonderful jewel of a bow
o best among men this bow of immeasurable energy dreadful and highly lustrous was bestowed on king janaka by devatas in a sacrificial assembly in the past
neither devas nor gandharvas nor asuras nor human are capable of stringing the bow by any means
mighty princes and kings have failed to string it in their attempt to know its strength
o best of men o descendent of kakustha there you will see the bow that belongs to the magnanimous king of mithila and the wonderful sacrifice at that place
o best among men that excellent bow strong in the middle was offered by king of mithila devarata as well as by all devatas as fruit of the sacrifice
o rama that bow is worshipped in the kings palace as principal deity with various kinds of perfumes sandal paste incense and fragrant agaru
having spoken thus viswamitra the best of ascetics commenced the onward journey along with the kakutshas and rishis taking leave of the deities of the forest
o ascetics of the forest may you be safe my purpose has been achieved in this siddhaashrama from here i shall go to the himavanta mountain situated on the northern bank of jahnavi said viswamitra
thereafter circumambulating the supreme siddhasrama with reverence they viswamitra and the princes commenced their journey in the northern direction
as viswamitra the best of ascetics set out on his journey expounders of the vedas followed him nearly in one hundred carriages
birds and beasts living in siddhaashrama also followed the illustrious maharshi viswamitra over a long distance until he sent them back
the sages travelled a long distance and halted on the bank of sona at sunset
the sages who possessed great splendour bathed and offered oblations to fire at sunset and sat in front of viswamitra
rama together with lakshmana having offered respectful salutations to the sages sat in front of the sagacious viswamitra
thereafter highly lustrous rama the best among men filled with curiosity enquired of the great sage viswamitra
o worshipful one what could be the reason for this region shining with luxuriant groves i wish to hear from you you can tell me all about this region may it be safe for you
a sage of excellent vows and rigid austerities viswamitra urged by the words of rama described in the midst of rishis the entire story relating to that region     thus ends the thirtyfirst sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
there was a great ascetic named kusa born to brahma as ascetic indefatigable in vows knowldegeable in dharma and a respector of the virtuous
that great soul kusa married the princess of vidarbha born in a noble family and a match for him he begot four virtuous sons who resembled him they were kusamba kusanabha adhurtarajas and vasu
kusa addressed his four brilliant sons who were highly enthusiastic pious truthful and were wedded to duties of the warrior race
o my sons govern with righteousness so that you will acquire immense merit hearing the words of the rishi the four sons who were the best among men and revered in the world constructed four cities as their abodes
the brilliant kushamba and the righteous kushanabha constructed the cities of kaushanbi and mahodaya as their capital respectively
o rama king adhurtarajasa constructed dharmaranya the best of cities and king vasu the city of girivrajam
o rama this place where we are called vasumati belongs to the magnanimous king vasu this is surrounded by five great shining mountains
the delightful and renowned river sumagadhi known as sona flowing in the country of magadha looks beautiful like a garland amidst five great mountains
rama this magadhi river of great vasu flows from the east surrounded by fertile crops fields like a garland
o scion of the raghu family the virtuous rajarshi kusanabha begot one hundred beautiful daughters through a nymph named ghritachi
those welladorned beautiful young maidens in the pleasuregarden looked like lightnings in the rainy season bedecked with fine ornaments they were singing dancing playing on instruments and moving in all directions in great delight
with beautiful limbs of unparalleled beauty on earth they shone in the pleasuregarden like stars in the midst of clouds
at the sight of the maidens embellished with all virtues and youth and beauty the allpervading windgod addressed them these words
i request you all to be my wives you will leave this feeling of mortality and attain a long life
youth is always unstable especially in human beings if you marry me you will be ever youthful like devatas
at the works of the untiringly blowing windgod the lunged maidens laughed and said
o best among devatas you move within all living beings we feel your impact why do you insult us
o best among devatas we are daughters of kusanabha we are capable of pulling you down from your position we are safeguarding our ascetic merit as virgins we could curse you to save our ascetic merit of kusnabha
o wicked one do not dishonour our father who always speaks the truth he will choose the bridegrooms righteously do not invite death father may be the cause of your death
our father is our lord our father is god to us whomsoever our father offers us shall become our husband
having heard the words of those maidens the most powerful and venerable windgod became furious he entered all the limbs of their bodies twisted and distorted them
their bodies disfigured and shattered by the windgod the maidens with tears flowing from their eyes entered the palace and fell down on the ground agitated and overtaken by shame
the king saw his extremely beautiful beloved daughters distressed and shattered and spoke these words with bewilderment
o daughters what has happened who has dishonoured virtue say it at once who has made you hunchbacked standing roud me why are you dumb the king heaved a sigh and entered into a state of samadhi      thus ends the thirtysecond sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
on hearing the words of sagacious kusanabha his hundred daughters touched his feet with their heads and said
o king the allpervading windgod having taken recourse to foul means intended to outrage our modesty without and moral compunction
we have our father who is dear to us hence we do not have freedom to choose you may ask our father if he is willing to give us in marriage
as all of us were speaking thus the sinful windgod disregarding our words repeatedly assaulted us
the deeply religious and highly powerful king having heard those words of his one hundred exceptional daughters replied
o daughters you have done a great act of forgiveness of which only the tolerant are capable by taking a united stand you have protected the honour of my dynasty
whether for women or men forgiveness is an ornament it is difficult even for gods for you daughters to show it without any difference of opinion is especially hard
forbearance is charity forbearance is sacrifice forbearance is truth forbearance is glory and forbearance is virtue o daughters the universe is supported by forbearance
o rama after sending away his daughters the king endowed with the power of the celestials and wellversed in the art of counselling consulted his ministers about a suitable person for marriage of his daughters at proper time and place
at that time a great and virtuous ascetic named chuli living in celebacy was performing austerities in pursuit of the knowledge of brahman
when he was performing austerities a nymph named somada daughter of urmila used to serve him prosperity to you
somada rendered her services with devotion and humility there she lived a religious life in the might time her spiritual guide was satisfied with her services
when her services came to a fruition with the passage of time maharshi chuli spoke to her i am pleased with you what favour shall i do for you may you be prosperous
having perceived that the sage was satisfied the gandharva who was skilled in speech said exceedingly delighted to the sage in a sweet voice
bestowed with the great asceticism and brilliance of a brahmin you look like brahma o righteous one i desire a son endowed with the ascetic virtues of a brahmin
i am without a husband my sire i am not a wife to any one since i have taken refuge in you you are competent to bestow on me a son with the power of your penance
pleased with her brahmarshi chuli gave her an excellent son to be wellknown as brahmadatta born through the will of his mind
then king brahmadatta son of somada lived in the city of kampilya with great prosperity like indra in heaven
o rama then the highly righteous king kusanabha decided to give his hundred daughters to brahmadatta
the lord of the earth highly powerful king kusanabha invited brahmadatta and gave his hundred daughters in marriage to him with a heart highly pleased
o son of raghus dynasty that king brahmadatta resembling indra received the hands of those maidens in due order
thereafter with the mere touch of his hand the hundred daughters were cured of their hump back and freed from anguish they assumed great beauty
king kusanabha having seen his daughters released from disfigurement caused by the windgod was immensely pleased he experienced waves of delight
then the king along with his queens performed the marriage of his daughters in the assembly of priests and sent them with brahmadatta to his kingdom
somada the gandharvi was exeedingly delighted with her daughtersinlaw and praised her son for his right action     thus ends the thirtythird sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
o son of raghus dynasty rama brahmadatta got married and left for his kingdom now a putreshti was performed by king kusanabha in order to beget a son
then while putreshti was on kusa the highly generous son of brahma said to king kusanabha
o son a highly virtuous son named gadhi similar to you will be born because of him you will obtain everlasting fame throughtout this world
o rama so saying to king kusanabha kusa left through space for the eternal brahmaloka
after some time a supremely righteous son by name gadhi was born to the sagacious kusanabha
o son of raghus dynasty the highly virtuous gadhi is my father i am known as kausika being born in the family of kusa
o raghava adherent of best religious practices is my elder sister well known by name satyavati she was bestowed in marriage to richika
following her husband my highly generous sister reached heaven with her human body and down assuming the form of a sacred river flowed kausiki
conferring the benefit of the other world and worldly pleasures on men my sister kausiki who is divine and beautiful having sacred waters took resort in himavat mountain and started flowing from there
o son of the raghus from then onwards with affection towards my sister kausiki i am living happily in the vicinity of himavat mountains
satyavati is sacred firmly established in truth and righteousness she is chaste holy and best among rivers she is known as river kausiki
rama for the sake of observance of austerity i have come to siddhaashrama leaving her behind having reached here i have fulfilled my desire through your valour
o mightyarmed rama since you asked me i narrated this my origin the history of my family and the history of this place
o son of the kakusthas while telling my stories midnight has passed by go to sleep now prosperity to you let there be no obstacles on our way
o son of the raghus the trees stand motionless with the beasts and birds calm all directions are pervaded with darkness
evening has gradually disappeared the sky is littered with stars and planets gleaming points of light as though they are the eyes of the skies
o lord the moon with his cool rays dispelling the darkness of the earth and delighting the minds of all living beings in this world is rising higher and higher
all nocturnal creatures groups of yakshas and rakshasas and dreadful eaters of human flesh are moving here and there
having spoken thus the highly lustrous great ascetic rested all sages praised him saying wellsaid wellsaid
this is the family of the kusas venerable always devoted to dharma foremost of men great like lord brahma
highly illustrious viswamitra you are similar to brahma among the rivers kausiki is the best refurbishing the image of your dynasty
in this way adored by the best of ascetics the auspicious son of kusika went to sleep like the lustrous sun setting
rama as well as lakshmana with a sense of wonder went to sleep full of admiration for the great ascetic     thus ends the thirtyfourth sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
viswamitra lay on the bank of sona with the ascetics for the rest of the night getting up at daybreak he said
rama the night makes way for the dawn it is time for morning rituals arise arise may the day bring good news get ready for the onward journey
on hearing his words rama performed morning oblations and getting ready for the onward journey spoke
o knower of brahman clean waters of this river are adorned with sandbanks this sona is deep which way shall we cross this river
having been addressed by rama thus viswamitra said we shall take the way the ascetics have gone before
with these words of the wise viswamitra the ascetics moved forward surveying various forests
after travelling a long distance for half a day they saw jahnavi the best among rivers haunted or worshipped by ascetics
on seeing the river ganga with swans and cranes floating on the surface of the sacred waters all the sages including the sons of the raghus rama and lakshmana were delighted
the birds had made the bank of the river their home they rama and lakshmana took a dip and offered traditional oblations to ancestors thereafter they lighted the sacrificial fire and made customary offerings to the fire and partook of the nectarlike remains with cheerful hearts they stood round the illustrious viswamitra and entered the sacred bank of jahnavi
then rama said to viswamitra o venerable one i wish to know why ganga flowing in three directions occupy purified the three worlds before entering the sea the lord of rivers
prompted by ramas words maharshi viswamitra started narrating the account of the birth and progress of river ganga
o rama the great mountain named himavan is a treasuretrove of ores he is the king of mountains he had two daughters unrivalled in beauty in this world
o rama himavans beloved of beautiful waist wellknown by the name of manorama is the daughter of mount meru she is the mother to both the daughters
o son of the raghus this ganga was born to manorama as himavans eldest daughter a second one born to him was wellknown by the name of uma
thereupon all the devatas desirous of deriving some advantage proposed that the eldest daughter of the king of mountains ganga flowing in three directions be given to them
in order to do good to the three worlds himavan rooted in dharma gifted his eldest daughter ganga who sanctifies the whole world by flowing at her free will
the devatas having received ganga committed to the welfare of the three worlds went back to their abodes with a sense of fulfilment in their mind
o delight of the raghus the other daughter of the mountain himavan was a maiden whose wealth was tapas she pursued a vow and observed severe austerities
himavan the best of mountains gave his daughter uma associated with severe austerities and venerated by the whole world in marriage to the unrivalled rudra
o son of the raghus ganga the holiest of rivers and uma devi are two daughters of the king of the mountains himavan they are worshipped by the entire world
o child with a marvellous gait i have related to you about ganga flowing across the three worlds ganga who reached the heaven first and all that
the divine ganga daughter of himavan beautiful and sinless carrying a large volume of water ascended the heavens     thus ends the thirtyfifth sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
while viswamitra preeminent ascetic among the sages was telling the story of ganga to the heroic rama and lakshmana they extolled it and enquired
o brahman sage this excellent story set in righteousness has been narrated by you since you are conversant with the details you can befittingly tell the story in detail pertaining to the eldest daughter of king of the mountains and the events that happened in the celestial and mortal worlds
why does ganga the purifier of the worlds overflow the three paths worlds o knower of dharma what deed made tripathaga flowing in three directions ganga wellknown in the three worlds as the best holiest of all rivers
having heard the words of the son of the kakusthas viswamitra vested with the wealth of asceticism revealed the complete story in detail in the presence of the sages
o rama in ancient times great ascetic the blueneck lord siva got married to goddess uma charmed with her beauty he indulged in sexual enjoyment with intense passion
o rama tormentor of enemies while lord siva was thus absorbed in sexual enjoyment a hundred celestial years passed but no son was born to them
then the devatas led by brahma were exceedingly alarmed who will be able to bear the power of the offspring if it is born here and now they reflected
all devatas approached siva and paying their obeisance said o god of the gods engaged in the welfare of all o mahadeva accept our salutations be king which you can be if you will
o best among the gods the worlds cannot contain your energy the son born of your energy you may engage yourself in penance in the company of uma in conformity with the vedas retain your energy in your body for the welfare of the three worlds
mahadeva ruler of the all the worlds having heard the words of devatas said be it so further
together with uma i will preserve the semen in my body thereby the devatas and also the earth will have peace
who will contain this exceptional vital fluid of mine if shaken from its own place o best of devatas tell me
thus questioned all the devatas replied to the bearer of the flag with bull as its symbol siva saying the earth will contain the disturbed vital fluid
thus replied by the devatas the god of the gods released his vital fluid on earth it pervaded the entire earth including mountains and forests
then the devatas said to the firegod enter this energy creative power related to rudra followed by the windgod
that energy pervaded by fire was transformed into the white mountain it turned the forest of reeds saravana blazing like the fire or the sun from that fire was born the glorious kartikeya
thereafter highly pleased with the event the devatas along with the saints worshipped siva and goddess uma with deep devotion
rama thereafter uma daughter of the mountain himavan with her eyes red with anger cursed all of them
from today onwards your wives will become childless cursed uma the devatas were cursed this even the earth
o earth you will assume many forms and become wife of many masters o evilminded one you did not want me to bear a son having been fouled as a result of my anger you will not have the pleasure of having a son cursed uma
the god of the gods mahesvara seeing all the devatas humiliated began to depart in the westerly direction presided over by varuna
mahesvara along with goddess uma went north of the himavat mountain and performed penance on a peak
o rama this story of the daughter of the mountain has been narrated to you now listen with lakshmana the tale of the birth of ganga     thus ends the thirtysixth sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
in olden days when iswara was engaged in austerities the devatas together with the ascetics approached lord brahma for an army general
then led by indra and the firegod all devatas approached lord brahma the grandsire saluted him with folded hands and spoke
o lord in ancient times your lordship gave us an army general at the time of creation he is engrossed in great penance along with uma
o knower of law and order o grandsire verily you are our supreme refuge committed to the welfare of the worlds tell us what we should do in this matter now that we cannot procreate a general on account of umas curse
hearing the words of the devatas brahma the grandsire of all the worlds consoled the devatas with sweet words saying
ganga keeps flowing in the celestial regions through ganga the firegod will beget a son who will be capable of destroying enemies he will become the army general of the gods
ganga the eldest daughter of the king of the mountains will tend that son of agni this will be totally acceptable to uma no doubt
o son of the raghus having heard brahmas words all the devatas considered themselves successful in their mission they saluted him with folded hands and offered their worship
all the devatas went to mount kailasa adorned with minerals and urged the firegod for a son
o lustrous firegod accomplish this divine work o god possessed of mighty energy release the vital fluid of iswara in ganga daughter of the king of mountains
the firegod gave his consent the devatas approached ganga and said o goddess bear the energy of siva inyour world since this cause is dear to the gods
hearing the words of the firegod ganga assumed a divine form beholding her glory the god of fire pervaded her from all sides
o rama then the firegod discharged the vital fluid of iswara preserved in his body which pervaded all sides of ganga and all her streams were filled with the fluid
ganga addressing the firegod standing ahead of all the devatas said o god of fire i am incapable of holding your everincreasing splendour the fiery fluid is burning me my consciousness is overwhelmed
thereafter the firegod who is the partaker of oblations offered to all deities said to ganga place this embryo on this slope of mountain himavan
o glorious sinless one rama hearing the words of the firegod ganga then expelled that resplendent embryo from her streams
the embryo that emerged from ganga reached the earth it resembled the lustre of molten gold it furned into gold auspicious bright and pure
there copper and iron were produced from its acidity zinc and lead from its residue various minerals were formed when that embryo reached the earth
when the embryo was placed in ganga it spread on all sides of the forest on the mountain irradiated with lustre the forest appeared golden
o tiger among men o scion of the raghus then onwards gold which is effulgent like fire became wellknown as jatarupa pure form the grass shrubs creepers and trees of that forest looked golden
thereafter kumara was born out of gangas womb the gods together with indra arranged six nymphs stars to act as nurses to suckle kumara as their own offspring
those krittikas having decided among themselves and having made an agreement with the gods saying this boy shall become a son to all of us fed the newborn with their milk breast milk
thereafter all the gods said this son shall become renowned in the three worlds as karttikeya son of krittikas there is no doubt
hearing the words of the gods the krittikas bathed the baby that descended from the womb of ganga resembling flaming fire and shining with great beauty
o scion of the kakusthas karttikeya lustrous like flaming fire was very fortunate descended from the womb of the ganga he is named skanda by the gods
then excellent milk surged in the breasts of krittikas assuming six mouths he sucked the milk
drinking milk just for a day and with a body still tender he could vanquish hosts of demons by his inborn prowess so capable be was
with the firegod in the forefront all the gods assembled and installed karttikeya shining on unsurpassed brilliant as commander of the gods forces
o rama this story of ganga and that of the birth of kumara who was fortunate and auspicious has been related to you in detail
o son of the kakusthas whosoever reveres kartikeya on this earth with devotion and faith shall have a long life sons and grandsons and after death will reach the world of skanda     thus ends the thirtyseventh sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
viswamitra an offspring of kusika having related the story of karthikeya to the son of the kakusthas rama said again
in olden days there lived a brave and righteous king named sagara who was ruler of ayodhya he was childless and desired to have children
o rama the daughter of the king of vidarbha by name kesini was sagaras eldest wife who was righteous and truthful
the daughter of arishtanemi named sumati was the second wife of sagara and none surpassed her in charm on earth
the king sagara accompanied by his wives reached himavat mountain and engaged himself in severe austerities on a peak called bhriguprasravana
when sagara completed a hundred years in austerities highly pleased by his performance ascetic bhrugu the best among the truthful granted him a boon
o sinless one you will get a very great progeny o best among men you will acquire unparalleled fame in this world
o child one wife will beget a son who will perpetuate your race and the other sixty thousand sons said bhrugu
thereafter both the daughters of the king were exceedingly delighted having propitiated that magnanimous asectic both of them with folded hands in supplication said
o knower of brahman which of us will beget one and who many sons o brahmarshi we wish to hear let your words come true
hearing their words highly virtuous bhrugu made an excellent statement saying in this matter you may exercise your free will
what would you wish one son who perpetuates the race or many possessed of mighty strength endowed with fame and perseverance asked bhrugu
o rama delight of the descendants of raghus on hearing the words of the ascetic in the presence of king sagara kesini chose the boon to have a son who perpetuates the race
then sumati the other wife sister of suparna garuda obtained the boon of sixty thousand sons endowed with fame and great perseverance
o son of the raghus the king along with his wives having circumambulated saint bhrugu bowed his head in reverence saluted him with folded hands and returned to his capital
after lapse of some time the eldest wife kesini gave birth to a son wellknown by name asamanjasa
o best among men sumati gave birth to a gourdlike foetus and when it burst open sixty thousand sons emerged
nurses placed all of them in pots filled with clarified butter and fostered them they attained adolescence after a long time
then after a long time sagaras sixty thousand sons attained beauty and youth
o best among men delight of the raghus in the mean time sagaras eldest son asamanjasa used to seize hold of children and throw them into the waters of river sarayu and while they were drowning he was laughing
thus this son inclined towards evil and formenting the good citizens was banished of the king from the capital for his indulgence in malevolent acts
asamanjasas son was anshuman he was valiant beloved and courteous to every one in the world
o best among men after a long time a thought came to the mind of sagara to definitely perform a sacrifice
o rama having determined to perform a sacrifice he sagara versed in the vedas started the initiatory rites for the sacrifice in the company of high priests      thus ends the thirtyeighth sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
immensely pleased with the words of viswamitra to the ascetic flaming bright like fire rama spoke towards the end of the narration
o brahman i wish to listen in detail as to how my ancestors made preparations for the sacrifice prosperity to you
viswamitra addressing the son of the kakusthas rama with a smile said o rama hear in detail the story of the magnanimous king sagara
sankaras fatherinlaw named himavan is the greatest mountain himavan and vindhya came close and began looking at one another because both are of extreme height and in between them there was no obstruction
o best of men the sacrifice took place in the region in between these two mountains o tiger among men the region was appropriate for conducting sacrificial acts
o child o son of the kakutsthas the great charioteer anshuman who can fight with eleven thousand charioteers wielding a strong bow followed the sacrificial horse in order to protect it in compliance with sagaras wish
on the concluding day of the fortnight full moon day while the sacrifice was being performed vasava indra assuming the form of rakshasa had stolen away sagaras sacrificial horse
o son of the kakutsthas when the magnanimous king sagaras sacrificial horse was stolen away all the high priests addressing the performer of the sacrifice said
o kakutstha on this auspicious fullmoon day the sacrificial horse has been stolen away suddenly and forcibly slay the thief and bring back the horse
this flaw in sacrifice will be inauspicious for all of us hence o king do everything which will ensure flawlessness to this sacrifice
having heard the words of the officiating priests the king sagara addressed his sixty thousand sons in the sacrificial assembly saying
o best among men o sons i do not the hand of rakshasas in this as this great sacrifice is consecrated by mantras to prevent any interruption and is presided over by eminent priests
therefore my sons go and search this entire earth surrounded by oceans may you be safe
o sons acquiring yojana by yojana the length and breadth of the earth search for the thief of the horse excavate the earth till the time the horse is found this is my command
having been initiated into the sacrifice i along with my grandson anshuman and other spiritual preceptors will stay here till such time the horse is found may you be safe
o rama thus commanded by sagara the highly powerful princes with cheeful hearts departed in obedience to their fathers command in quest of the horse on earth
o tiger among men each one of them occupying one yojana in length and breadth of ground dug up the earth with their nails that were sharp as diamonds
o son of the raghus rama dreadful sounds emanated while the earth was being broken open by ploughs and lances similar to thunderbolt
o descendant of raghu when the earth was being churned an irrepressible sound of serpents demons and rakshasas of all creatures emerged
o descendant of the raghus the heroic sons of sagara excavated sixty thousand yojanas of earth reaching the nether world one of the several regions below the earth
o foremost among men rama the princes while thus excavating jambu dweepa in this way filled with mountains moved around everywhere
then the gods together with the gandharvas asuras and serpents in bewildered minds approached lord brahma
with highly agitated minds and meloncholic faces all of them approached magnanimous brahma and having propitiated him said
o venerable one the entire earth is being excavated by the sons of sagara many great beings living in the lower worlds are being killed
this one is the destroyer of our sacrifice he has stolen away our horse saying so the sons of sagara are slaying all living beings      thus ends the thirtyninth sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
having heard the devatas extremely frightened and deprived of their sensual perception by the prowess of fate the adorable grandsire brahma replied
this whole earth belongs to sagacious vasudeva he always supports the earth assuming the form of kapila the princes will be burnt by the fire of his wrath
the excavation of this earth and the destruction of the short lived sons of sagara is predestined since eternity
o destroyer of enemies rama on hearing the words of the grandsire brahma the thirtythree gods exceedingly delighted returned the way they had come
a sound like the resembling of thunder emanated while the earth was being riven by the noble sons of sagara
afterwards all the sons of sagara having riven the earth approached their father and circumamulating him said
the entire earth was ransacked mighty devatas demons rakshasas pisachas uragas and kinnaras were killed yet we could neither see the horse nor the thief of the horse reflect over this matter and direct us prosperity to you
o rama incensed to fury at the words of his sons magnanimous king sagara replied
rive the earth again and excavate capture the one who has stolen the horse and return after having accomplished the purpose safety to you
receiving the command of their father the magnanimous sagara his sixty thousand sons ran towards rasatala nether world
then while they were excavating the region they beheld the elephant of the quarter named virupaksha equal in size to a mountain supporting the earth
o descendant of raghu the mighty elephant virupaksha was holding on its head the entire earth with its mountains and forests
o descendant of kakustha when that mighty elephant shakes its head for rest from weariness on certain sacred days earthquake occurs
o rama having circumabulated and honoured that mighty elephant the protector of the quarter they reached the rasatala by riving the earth
subsequently having dug the eastern region they went on to southern and dug it too in the southern region they beheld a mighty elephant magnanimous mahapadma resembling a great mountain to their astonishment they saw that elephant holding the earth on its head
thereafter illustrious sagaras sixty thousand sons having circumabulated the elephant of the western region dug up that region
possessed of great strength they beheld also in the western quarter a great elephant of the quarter named saumanasa resembling a mountain
having paid homage and enquiring as to his wellbeing they arrived at the northern region by digging the earth
o rama in the northern region they beheld an auspicious elephant named bhadra who was white like snow was holding that quater
then all sixty thousand sons having touched the elephant and circumambulated it penetrated the earth
subsequently the sons of sagara having gone towards the celebrated northeastern region began to dig with wrath
great sons of sagara terribly swiftfooted and exceedingly powerful beheld the eternal visnu in sage kapila and not far away from him the horse grazing o descendant of raghu they all experienced unparalleled joy
they recognised that best of horses their eyes were red with anger armed with spades ploughshares and every kind of tree and stone and furious with wrath they rushed towards kapila shouting wait wait
o wickedminded one you have stolen our sacrificial horse know that those of us who have come here are the sons of sagara
o descendant of raghu kapila having heard their words overwhelmed with great wrath uttered the sound hm
o delight of the raghus king sagara realising that his sons had left long ago said to his grandson anshuman resplendent with his own lustre
you are valiant you have acquired knowledge in various fields you are illustrious like your ancestors pursue the track taken by your uncles and by the thief who ran away with the horse
creatures in the depths of the earth are powerful and mighty carry with you a bow and weapons to counter their attack
honour those who deserve it kill those who cause obstacles to sacrifice come back with your mission accomplishing and ensure the successful completion of my sacrifice
having been throughly instructed by the highsouled sagara in this way anshuman left with rapid strides carrying a scimitar and a bow
o best among men directed by the king sagara anshuman followed the path taken by his noble uncles into the depths of the earth
exceedingly valiant ashuman beheld the elephant of the quarter worshipped by daityas danavas rakshasas pisachas birds and serpents
having circumambulated the elephant he anshuman enquired about his wellbeing the where abouts of his uncles and also about the one who had stolen the sacrificial horse
having listened to the words of anshuman the elephant of the quarter replied o anshuman son of asamanjasa having fulfilled your objective you will go back soon with the horse
having listened to the words of the elephant anshuman started enquring the well being of each of the guardians elephants of the quarters successively with due respect
all those elephants of the quarters were knowers of the essence of words and proficient in the right use of words treating him kindly the elephants encouraged him saying you will go back with the horse
hearing their words with a quick pace where he reached the place his uncles sons of sagara were reduced to heaps of ashes
then the son of asamanjasa overwhelmed with sorrow and deeply distressed at their destruction bewailed with great grief
possessed by grief and tears anshuman that tiger among men beheld the sacrificial horse grazing nearby
with the intention of performing traditional funeral rites with water for the deceased princes highly lustrous anshuman looked around for water but could not see any reservoir of water in the neighbourhood
o rama with his keen eyes he anshuman marked suparna the maternal uncle of his uncles lord of the eagles garuda bestowed with the swiftness of the wind
highly powerful garuda son of vinata addressing anshuman said o tiger among men do not grieve this act of assasination is meant for the welfare of the three worlds
your valiant uncles have been burnt by kapila of boundless power o sagcious one performing traditional rites with ordinary water is not proper
o best among men o mightyarmed one perform the traditional rites of your uncles with water from river ganga the eldest daughter of himavat
ganga the purifier of the three worlds will sanctify your uncles reduced to heaps of ashes these heaps when inundated by waters of ganga beloved of the worlds will take all the sixty thousand sons to heaven
o highly fortunate one o best among men go back with that horse o hero it behoves of you to complete the sacrifice undertaken by your grandfather
exceedingly powerful and highly renowned anshuman on hearing the words of garuda returned quickly to the capital with the horse
o descendant of the raghus rama having reached the king who had been initiated into the ceremony anshuman communicated faithfully to him all that had happened he also reported the words suparna had said
the king heard was stunned to hear the awful words of anshuman yet he performed the sacrifice in accordance with traditional scriptures and kalpa the vedanga
the great lord of the earth king sagara after performing the sacrifice reached his capital but he could not devise any means to bring ganga down to the earth
the mighty king sagara over a long period of time without being able to devise means to bring ganga down to the earth ruled the kingdom for thirty thousand years and ascended to heaven      thus ends the fortyfirst sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
o rama when sagara died the subjects installed the highly virtuous anshuman as king
o descendnt of the raghus that anshuman became a very great monarch he had a great son dilipa who became famous
o delight of the raghus having vested the kingdom with dilipa anshuman performed rigid penance on the sacred peak of the himavat mountain
o rama highly renowned anshuman having lived for thirtytwo thousand years in the tapovana turned an ascetic and attained heaven without accomplishing his objective
when exceedingly brilliant dilipa heard about the death of his grandfathers he was overtaken by grief but could not arrive at any conclusion with his intellect regarding means of bringing down the sacred river
how to bring about the descent of ganga how to perform funeral rites of the ancestors with ganga water how to liberate them thus dilipa was constantly engaged in such thoughts
as dilipa known for his knowledge of the soul constantly reflected righteously on this matter of ganga a highly virtuous son named bhagiratha was born to him
most brilliant king dilipa ruled the kingdom for thirty thousand years performing many sacrifices
o tiger among men king dilipa was unable to arrive at a conclusion regarding the salvation of his ancestorshe was affected by illness and died
the king dilipa performed the coronation of his son bhagiratha and reached the region of indra as a reward for virtuous acts done by him
o delight of the raghus righteous bhagiratha who was highly lustrous rajarshi was without sons he was desirous of progeny but did not beget children
o son of the raghus rama bhagiratha with a determination to bring down ganga entrusted the kingdom to his ministers and went to a sacred place known as gokarna there with arms uplifted surrounded by four fires partaking food once a month with his senses controlled carried out panchatapa for a number of years
o mightyarmed rama bhagiratha continued in that state for a thousand years amidst rigid austerities lord of all creatures brahma was highly pleased with that illustrious king
thereafter the grandsire arrived with the gods and spoke to the noble bhagiratha engaged in austerities
o distinguished one o mighty monarch o bhagiratha of excellent vows i am pleased with your welldisciplined austerities ask for a boon
brilliant glorious bhagiratha stood before the grandsire of all the worlds with folded palms and spoke
o lord if you are pleased with my austerities and if they are worthy of a reward grant me the boon whereby all the sons of sagara will receive from me funeral rites with the waters of ganga
the ashes of these eminent uncles of my grandfather immersed by the waters of ganga may ultimately go to heaven
o lord let the progeny be perpuated in our race of the ikshvakus let not that dynasty be terminated with me this is another boon i seek
to this the grandsire of all the worlds replied with a sweet voice full of good wishes and sweet words
o great charioteer bhagiratha your desire is great o perpetuator of dynasty of the ikshvakus let your wish be fulfilled prosperity to you
this hymavati ganga is himavats eldest daughter and only lord siva is capable to hold the force of her descent to earth therefore let siva be entreated
o king gangas descent cannot be sustained by earth o hero i do not see any other person to hold her than the wielder of the trident siva
the creator of the worlds having thus addressed the king and conversing with ganga went towards heaven along with devatas and maruts      thus ends the fortysecond sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
o rama when that god of the gods brahma departed bhagiratha pressing the earth with the tip of his big toe standing supported by the big toe penanced meditated upon siva for one year
after one full year was completed iswara who is worshipped by all in all the worlds said to king bhagiratha
o best of men i am pleased with your devotion i will hold ganga on my head the daughter of the king of mountains to reduce the force of her descent i shall do your wish
then ganga the eldest daughter of himavat who is adored by all the worlds assuming the form of a mighty river descended from the sky with unbearable speed on the auspicious head of siva
goddess ganga extremely difficult to contain thought that seizing siva with her flow she would enter the lower regions of the earth
then the threeeyed lord siva aware of her proud intentions applied his intelligence to conceal her
o rama that sacred river ganga descended on to the depths of the matted locks on the holy head of siva resembling the mount himavan
trapped in the matted locks she ganga could not come out with all her efforts she could not reach the earth
there the golden ganga wandered about for many years bhagiratha not finding ganga once again resorted to great penance
o son of the raghus rama siva was immensely pleased with the penace and thereafter released ganga drop by drop forming bindusara
as she ganga was released she branched out into seven streams three streams known as hladini pavani and nalini having auspicious waters and conferring prosperity flowed eastwards
auspicious suchakshu sita and a great river sindhu these three great rivers flowed westwards
the seventh stream among them followed bhagiratha the most brilliant rajarshi bhagiratha also mounting on divine chariot raced forward and ganga followed him
from the sky on to the head of shankara and thence ganga resorted to the earth there it flowed forward with a roaring sound
then the earth looked bright with the fallen and falling shoals of fish turtles and multitudes of other seaanimals
then devarshis gandharvas yakshas and hosts of siddhas looked on with astonishment at ganga falling from the sky and descending on the earth
then gods in a state of excitement in their aerial chariots as large as cities on horses and on big elephants were stationed there in the sky
gods with great lustre arrived to witness the most wonderful grand descent of ganga
the cloudless sky shone with the radiance of the ornaments of the gods alighting speedily to witness ganga it appeared as though the sky was filled with a hundred suns
the sky strewn with lightnings appeared as if it was inhabited by seaanimals serpents and fishes fickle
white foams of water were scattered in a thousand ways it appeared as if the sky was spread over with autumnal clouds flocks of swans
ganga was flowing now rapid now slow now wide now meandering now low now high
sometimes waves dashed against waves they rose repeatedly upwards and fell down on the ground
the waters of ganga descended on shankaras head and from there to the earth freed from all impurities the waters looked pure and clean
considering the waters fallen from the head of siva sacred devatas rishis and gandharvas and those living on earth touched it with reverence
those cursed to fall from heaven to earth were absolved of their sins after bathing there in the waters of ganga
cleansed of their sins by the sparkling waters they ascended through the sky once again to their own celestial worlds
people rejoiced at the sight of those shining waters they were happy to have a dip in ganga and their fatigue was gone
most brilliant rajarshi bhagiratha also mounting the divine chariot moved forward and ganga followed him
o rama besides acquatic beings rishis devatas daityas danavas rakshasas along with kinnaras serpents foremost of gandharvas yakshas and apsaras all followed the chariot of bhagiratha they were happy to follow ganga
ganga famous and foremost of rivers destroyer of all sins flowed in the direction king bhagiratha moved
then while ganga was flowing it inundated the sacrificial ground of the great sage jahnu jahnu who used to work wonders was performing a sacrifice
o descendant of the raghu dynasty sage jahnu who was performing the sacrifice observed her pride and grew furious and astonishingly drank the entire waters of ganga
devatas rishis and gandharvas stood amazed at this act they worshipped the magnanimous jahnu noblest among men the devatas entreated the illustrious jahnu to treat ganga as his daughter
the brilliant jahnu was pleased he released her through both his both ears hence ganga is called jahnavi daughter of jahnu
ganga best among rivers following the chariot of bhagiratha reached the ocean she entered the nether regions of the earth in order to fulfil his mission salvation of the sons of sagara
rajarshi bhagiratha having brought ganga with supreme efforts saw with a sad heart his grandfathers reduced to ashes
o best of the raghus thereafter the holy waters of ganga inundated those heaps of ashes and the sons of sagara purged of their sins reached heaven said viswamitra      thus ends the fortythird sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
thereupon that king followed by ganga reached the ocean and entered the lower regions of the earth where the sons of sagara were found reduced to ashes
after the ashes were inundated by the waters of ganga brahma lord of the world appeared before king bhagiratha and said
o tiger among men sixty thousand sons of illustrious sagara having been liberated had gone towards heaven like devatas
o king as long as the waters in the ocean exist in this world shall the sons of sagara live in heavens like gods
this ganga will become your eldest daughter and from now on she will be wellknown in this world as bhagirathi after your name
o king divine ganga will be called tripathaga as well as bhagirathi since she flows in the three worlds heaven earth and the lower world patala she will be known as tripathaga
o lord of men o king you may offer the waters of ganga here to all your ancestors and thereby fulfil your vow
o king by the highly renowned ancestors of yours the foremost among righteous ones even sagara this desire has not been fulfilled
o child similarly though anshuman possessed unparalleled prowess in this world his prayer to ganga his vow could not be fulfilled
o sinless one bhagiratha o distinguished one on the part of dilipa brilliant your father who had the virtuous of a rajarshi who was equal to a maharshi in splendour and to me in austerities and abiding to the duties of a kshatriya it was even not possible to bring ganga through prayer
o best among men you have fulfilled that vow you have achieved supreme renown and reverence in this world
o destroyer of enemies by bringing about the descent of ganga you have secured a great abode in dharma
o best among men o tiger among men take a dip in the eternally sacred waters purify yourself and acquire holiness

the illustrious rajarshi bhagiratha performed the rites of offering the sacred water of ganga in accordance with proper order and tradition for the sons of sagara purified with the ablutions entered his own city o best of the raghus his desire thus fulfilled he continued to rule the kingdom thereafter
o best of the raghus the world rejoiced having bhagiratha as king with his purpose achieved he was freed from all mental afflictions and sorrows and thereafter lived happily

o son of the kakusthas whosoever listens to this auspicious story relating to the descent of ganga with concentration all his desires will be achieved his sins will be destroyed and his longevity and fame will increase     thus ends the fortyfourth sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
on hearing the words of viswamitra rama along with lakshmana filled with astonishment said to him
o knower of the brahman this story narrated by you relating to the descent of the sacred ganga and the fullness of the ocean due to gangas fall is very wonderful
then rama along with lakshmana spent the whole night reflecting on the auspicious story narrated by viswamitra
thereafter the progeny of the raghus the destroyer of enemies rama addressed viswamitra in the clear early morning after viswamitra had completed his routine rites
o noble ascetic we have heard this great story worthy to be listened as we both lay pondering over the entire story narrated by you the glorious night passed off just like a moment
we will cross over ganga the best of rivers the sacred river that flows in three directionsthis boat of pious saints which is well laidout has come here swiftly having come to know that you o venerable one have arrived
hearing the words of noble rama he viswamitra accompanied by hosts of sages besides rama and lakshmana made arrangements to cross the river
having reached the northern bank they paid homage to the sages encamped on the bank of ganga and beheld the city of vishala
thereupon viswamitra the best of ascetics accompanied by rama and lakshmana soon proceeded towards the enchanting and splendid city of vishala comparable to heaven
thereafter great intellectual rama with folded palms enquired of eminent ascetic viswamitra about the excellent city of vishala
o distinguished ascetic which royal dynasty is ruling this city of vishala could you tell me great is my curiosity may you prosper
viswamitra preeminent among ascetics hearing the words of rama commenced to relate the history of the ancient city of vishala
o rama hear the auspicious legend of indra listen too what had happened to this country
o blessed rama in kritayuga the sons of diti were very strong and those of aditi were spirited and righteous
o best among men a thought came to those illustrious ones how can we be free from old age death and disease
o rama while the noble sons were reflecting over this matter an idea flashed across their minds to get nectar by churning the ocean of milk
thereupon having decided to churn the ocean mind those very powerful ones made vasuki the great snake as a rope and mandara mountain as the churning rodand started churning it
after a thousand years the hoods of the snake made as rope vomitted venom and started biting the rocks of the mandara mountain with their teeth
therefrom was produced halahala virulent venom resembling firethe entire universe consisting of devatas asuras and mortals was burnt down
the devatas sought refuge in the great god rudra who causes happiness the lord of all living beings save us save us the cried
thereupon hari the lord of celestial beings extolled by the devatas appeared bearing the conch and discus
hari smiling said to the tridentbearing rudra o chief of celestial beings you were born the earliest among the devatas therefore while churning the ocean whichever is produced first shall be offered to you considering it the first offering o lord accept this venom
visnu the highest among the devatas having the spoken vanished siva who had heard visnus words and seen the fear of the gods received that dreadful halahala treating it as nectar
lord of the gods venerable siva went away to his abode leaving behind the devatas o descendant of raghu then all the devatas and asuras resumed churning
o sinless one after the mountain mandara used as churning rod sank down to nether world patala the devatas along with the gandharvas invoked visnu
o mightyarmed visnu you are the ultimate refuge for all living beings specially for the devatas protect us you alone are fit to lift up the mandara mountain
having heard these words the controller of the sense organs visnu assumed the form of a tortoise reclined in the ocean supporting the mountain on its back
visnu the supreme being the soul of the universe standing amidst the devatas took hold of the peak of mountain with his hand and continued to churn the ocean
in this way thousand years rolled by in the beginining came out dhanvantari holding a staff and a water pot carried by ascetics and apsaras of high lustre
o best among men excellent women emerged out of the essence produced by churning of waters therefore they are known as apsarasas
o rama diti was afflicted with great grief when her sons were killed she addressed her husband kasyapa son of maricha saying
o adorable one your highly powerful sons devatas have killed mine through extensive austerities i am desirous of obtaining a mighty son capable of killing indra
i shall practise austerities you ought to grant me a son who would be the supreme ruler of the world and capable of killing indra you can say yes if you will
then marichas son exceedingly bright kasyapa on hearing the words of diti who was deeply grieved replied
o one vested with the wealth of austerities be it so prosperity to you remain chaste you will deliver a son who will kill indra in the battle
if you remain pure and clean on completion of a thousand years you will give birth to a son through me who will be the lord of the three worlds
highly brilliant kasyapa having thus spoken touched her gently with his palm stroked her body and said may good betide thee having said this kasyapa went away to perform austerities
o foremost among men after kasyapa had left diti exceedingly delighted at the prospect of having sons reached kushaplavana and practised intense mortifications
o foremost of men great treasure of virtues while she was practising austerities the thousandeyed indra began to serve her
the thousandeyed indra served her by providing fire kusha grass sticks for burning water fruits roots and all other things desired by her
indra attended on diti stroking her limbs gently from time to time to help her regain their suppleness and alleviate her fatigue
o son of the raghus ten years before completion of a thousand years diti highly pleased with the services rendered by indra addressed him saying
o best of the gods your illustrious father granted me a boon for a son i sought on completion of a thousand years of penance
o the best of the brave ten years is yet to go for completion of austerities you will have a brother may you prosper
o child ill create in him eagerness victory together with him you will gain victory over the three worlds relieved of sorrows enjoy youll with him
after speaking thus to indra goddess diti overpowered with sleep around midsday dropped off her feet towards her head
indra laughed he rejoiced at the sight of her ominous posture of sleeping with her feet towards her head and her hair falling on her feet
o rama with great courage indra entered her womb and severed her embryo into seven pieces
o rama that embryo being severed by vajra having a hundred edges cried at high pitch which awakened diti
highly powerful indra even while saying to the crying embryo do not weep do not weep severed it
do not kill do not kill said diti subsequently indra in deference to the words of his mother emerged out of the womb
armed with vajra indra addressed diti with folded palms saying o devi you have slept with your head towards your feet and your hair falling on your feet
i have seized the opportunity and severed into seven pieces the foetus who would have been a slayer of indra o devi shoudnt you forgive me     thus ends the fortysixth sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
deeply distressed diti having come to know that the embryo had been severed into seven pieces humbly spoke to the unassailable indra
o indra slayer of balasura because of my fault this embryo has been made into seven pieces and rendered useless in this matter you have not committed any fault
this disaster to the embryo has happened contrary to expectations hence i seek a favour from you let these seven pieces become seven guardians of marut regions regions of the wind
o son all these seven are my sons of celestial beautythey will become pesiding deities for vata skandha divisions of wind and let them be wellknown as maruts wandering in the universe
among them one will move about in brahmaloka another in indraloka and the third well known as vayu will move around in the sky
o best of devatas by your command the other four sons will remain celestial and will range about in four directions
the thousandeyed indra slayer of bala on hearing ditis words addressed her with folded palms saying
everything will no doubt happen the way you said your sons will wander about as celestial beings prosperity to you
o rama mother and sons having arrived at this conclusion in the tapovana ascended to heaven with their desire fulfilled this is what we have heard
o descendant of kakustha rama this is that country which was formerly inhabited by indra here indra attended on diti who achieved the fruit of her austerities
o tiger among men rama this highly virtuous and wellknown son named vishala was born to ikshvakus in alambusa where a city named vishala was built
o rama mighty hemachandra was vishalas son hemachandras successor was the celebrated suchandra

by the grace of the ikshvakus all the kings of vishala have been long lived and exalted valiant and deeply religious
o rama we shall spend the right happily here o best among men on the tomorrow we see janaka
having heard of the arrival of viswamitra the celebrated sumati most brilliant chief of kings proceeded to receive him
along with his spiritual preceptors and relatives he paid viswamitra great respect enquired his wellbeing and said
o sage no one is more blessed than me since you have favoured me with your arrival in my country     thus ends the fortyseventh sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
getting together they enquired one anothers health and then sumati spoke to the great ascetic viswamitra
o sage wish you well who are these two youths who seem to possess the prowess of celestial beings they walk with the gait of an elephant or a lion they are courageous like tiger or a bull their large eyes are like lotuspetals they are armed with scimitars bows and quivers they are young and handsome like aswinikumaras dropped from heaven casually whose sons are they how did they come here on foot with what purpose
o great ascetic they resemble each other in personality expression and gestures they adorn this land like sun and moon in the sky holding excellent weapons these heroes have trodden paths difficult to traverse for what purpose have they come i want to hear clearly
on hearing his words he viswamitra related all about their stay at siddhashrama and the slaying of rakshasas
after hearing viswamitra the king sumati got exceedingly delighted and extended hospitality in accordance with tradition to the highly valiant sons of dasaratha the distinguished guests worthy of honour
the descendants of raghu rama and lakshmana having received great honour from sumati stayed there one night and thereafter set out for mithila
all the ascetics having seen that auspicious city of janaka worshipfully admired mithila saying excellent excellent
at the sight of an old uninhabited beautiful and desolate hermitage in a grove near mithila the descendant of the raghus enquired of the foremost among the ascetics viswamitra
o venerable one i wish to know why this auspicios looking hermitage was deserted by ascetics to whom did this belong in the past
eloquent and brilliant viswamitra replied to the descendant of the raghus saying
o descendant of the raghus i shall tell all you about this hermitage cursed by the wrath of a great man
o best among men this hermitage resembling a celestial retreat and wellhonoured even by devatas once belonged to illustrious gautama
o highly renowned prince it was here in ancient times that gautama in the company of ahalya practised austerities for several years
the thousandeyed indra consort of sachi having found an opportunity during the absence of the ascetic assumed the guise of the ascetic gautama and said to ahalya
o most beautiful one those overtaken by passion would not await the completion of the menstrual period favourable for copulation o woman of fine waist i desire union with you
o delight of the raghus the evilintentioned ahalya inclined towards the king of the celestials and knowing him to be the thousandeyed indra in the guise of the ascetic consented for the union
o foremost of men with her hearts desire fulfilled ahalya said o chief of the celestials im satisfied o lord quit this place o lord of cthe gods protect yourself and also me from gautama in all respects
indra smilingly said to ahalya o one with lovely hips i am gratified i shall go away the way i have come
o rama he indra came out of the leafhut quickly after his union with her apprehensive of gautama
subsequently indra beheld the great ascetic gautama unassailable by devatas and danavas endowed with the power of ascetism drenched with sacrifical waters shining like flaming fire carrying sacrificial firewood and kusha grass and preeminent among sages entering that leaf hut
on seeing him the face of the lord of the gods indra turned pale with fear having seen the wicked indra with a thousandeyed in the guise of an ascetic the gentle sage gautama got enraged and said
o wicked natured one assuming my form you have done a forbidden act for that reason you shall be devoid of scrotum
cursed thus out of anger by eminent gautama the testicles of indra immediately dropped down on the earth
having thus cursed indra he also cursed ahalya you will be staying here for thousands of years without food and subsisting on air lying down in ashes doing penance without being seen by any living beings in this ashrama
when the son of dasaratha the unassailable rama enters this dreadful forest you will be cleansed of this sin
o wickednatured one by offering hospitality to rama without covetousness and passion you will happily live with me by regaining your present form
highly powerful gautama who had performed rigid austerities thus cursed the wicked ahalya and left this hermitage for the peaks of himavat mountain served by siddhas and charanas here he performed austeritiessaid viswamitra     thus ends the fortyeighth sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
deprived of testicles indra with a frightened face addressed hordes of rishis and charanas with agni in the forefront
i have accomplished the objective of the devatas by creating obstacles to gautamas austerities evoking in consequence the wrath of the magnanimous sage
by his gautamas wrath i have been deprived of my testicles she ahalya has been deserted by him he has lost his ascetic energy through the pronouncement of this great curse
for that reason o rishis charanas and great devatas it is your duty to restore my testicles for the benefit i have given you
hearing indra all the devatas accompanied by maruts lead by the firegod devatas approached and said
this ram which has received the share of your sacrificial offerings has testicles as indra has been deprived of his own take these testicles immediately and graft them on to indra
hearing the words of the firegod the pitrudevatas assembled uprooted the testicles of the ram and grafted them on to indra
o son of the kakutsthas from then on the pitrudevatas have been accepting rams without testicles as offerings in a sacrifice with rams testicles fitted on to indra
o son of the raghus illustrious gautamas power of ascetism was such that thenceforth indra possessed the testicles of a ram
most brilliant rama therefore enter the hermitage of the pious gautama and liberate this fortunate ahalya of divine appearance from the curse
in response to the words of viswamitra rama and lakshmana entered the hermitage viswamitra in front
rama beheld the highly fortunate ahalya shining brilliantly with the power of her asceticism she could not be seen even by men suras or asuras joined together she looked divine and illusory as if created with special efforts by brahma though not clearly visible she was shining bright like the light of the full moon muffled by mists in the sky and like the inviolable light of the sun reflected in the water
by the words of gautama she became invisible to the three worlds till the appearance of rama
with the expiry of the period of the curse the raghavas rama and lakshmana speared and she became perceptible when rama touched her feet
recalling the words of gautama she received them with water to wash their feet and offerings made with due devotion rama accepted her hospitality extended in accordance tradition
amidst sounds of celestial kettledrums devatas showered flowers gandharvas sang and apsarasa danced there was a great assemblage of divinities
on seeing ahalya her body purified by the power of penance at gautamas command the devatas worshipfully exclaimed excellent excellent
brilliant gautam the great ascetic along with ahalya worshipped rama according to tradition with delight and continued with his austerities
having received due hospitality from the great ascetic gautama rama also set out towards mithila     thus ends the fortyninth sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
rama accompanied by lakshmana with viswamitra ahead proceeded in northeasterly direction and reached the sacrificial ground
rama with lakshmana told the tiger among ascetics viswamitra that the preparations or the sacrifice by the illustrious king janaka were excellent
o illustrious sage thousands of brahmins living in different countries and versed in the study of the vedas have assembled here the shelters for ascetics are thronged with hundreds of carts o great ascetic let us choose a place where we can stay
great ascetic viswamitra hearing ramas words chose a nottoocrowded place near a watersource for encampment
when the king heard of the arrival of viswamitra he went forward with satananda the blemishless family priest walking ahead in order to welcome him with humility
eminent officiating priests speedily brought the offerings of worship and paid obeisance to viswamitra with prayers
viswamitra received illustrious king janakas worship and enquired about the welfare of the king and the conduct of the sacrifice
viswamitra duly enquired the wellbeing of the sages and the spiritual teachers priests in right order and thereafter the rest joined them in great delight
the king then folded his hands in supplication to the foremost of ascetics viswamitra saying o venerable one please be seated along with the eminent ascetics
in response to janakas words great sage viswamitra occupied his seat thereafter the family priests officiationg priests of the sacrifice counsellors and also the king occupied their seats according to their rank
thereafter the king looked on all sides and saw all of them seated according to their rank and addressed viswamitra saying
today my sacrifice has been rendered fruitful by the devatas i have reaped the fruit of my sacrifice today by your venerable presence
o preeminent among ascetics o brahmana you have come to my sacrificial mandap along with these ascetics blessed am i obliged am i
o brahmarshi learned men say only twelve days remain for completion of this acrifice thereafter o viswamitra you should see devatas claiming their shares
having said this the king janaka with a cheerful countenance and saluting with folded palms again asked that tiger among ascetics viswamitra
o sage viswamitra be blessed who are these two young men with the prowess of the celestials the gait of an elephant or a lion they resemble a tiger or a bull in courage they have large eyes like lotuspetals they are armed with scimitars bows and quivers with their approaching youth they resemble the aswinikumaras in beauty they look like gods who have descended on earth from heaven out of their free will whose sons are they how did they come here on foot and for what purpose
great ascetic these two young men with hair falling on their temples like the wings of a crow each of them resemble the other in personality expressions and gestures wielding excellent weapons they adorn this land like the moon and the sun deck the sky whose sons are they i wish truly to hear about these heroes
hearing the words of the magnanimous janaka viswamitra presented them to him saying that they were the illustrious sons of dasaratha
the great ascetic viswamitra who was highly powerful related to the distinguished janaka in full their undaunted journey to siddhashrama and the slaughter of rakshasas there the view of the city of vishala meeting with ahalya and gautama and the inquisitiveness about the great bow which brought them to mithila and then kept quiet      thus ends the fiftieth sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
satananda the eldest son of gautama a great sage who looked brilliant with the power of austerities was thrilled to hear the words of viswamitra the intellectual and experienced great astonishment on beholding rama
satananda saw the two princes comfortably seated nearby and said to viswamitra the foremost of the ascetics
o tiger among ascetics was my renowned mother who had been practising intense austerities for long shown to the prince rama
did my highly lustrous and celebrated mother offer homage to rama worthy of reverence by all living beings with things available in the forest
o highly powerful sage was rama told the old story about the misdeed of god indra to my mother
o son of kushika viswamitra be blessed o the best among the ascetics as a result of beholding rama was my mother united with my father
o son of kushika was rama honoured by my father was my most brilliant father honoured by illustrious rama when he arrived
o kushikas son did pious rama welcome my father with a tranquil mind when he arrived
great sage viswamitra equipped with the knowledge of words heard satananda who was proficient in speech and replied
o best of ascetics satananda all that is required to be done has been done and nothing was omitted ahalya was united with sage gautama like renuka with jamadagni
having heard viswamitra the highly brilliant satananda said to rama

highly lustrous viswamitra has performed deeds which defy all imagination by his austerities he became brahmarshi and possesses unparalleled radiance know him to be the supreme resort
rama son of kushika viswamitra who has performed great austerities is your protector therefore there is none on this earth more fortunate than you
i shall tell you about the power and achievement of the magnanimous son of kushika viswamitra listen
this righteousminded sage subduer of enemies knower of dharma knowledgeable in all branches of learning devoted to the welfare of his subjects ruled as a king for long
there was a king named kusa who was the son of brahma his son was kusanabha who was supremely righteous and strong
wellknown gadhi was the son of kusanabha highly lustrous and mighty ascetic viswamitra is the son of gadhi
highly lustrous viswamitra ruled the earth as a king he ruled over his kingdom for thousands of years
once that highly lustrous viswamitra having assembled his army of the magnitude of akshauhini went round the earth
rama while viswamitra was wandering about kingdoms cities rivers mountains and hermitages he gradually reached the ashram of vasishta that hermitage afounded in a variety of trees species of animals siddhas charanas devatas danavas gandharvas and kinnaras multitudes of birds and resting deer it was inhabited by brahmarshis and devarishis by sages who had attained perfection through austerities by those resembling fire in brightness by the magnanimous and the selfrestrained by those who had conquered anger and controlled their senses who was devoted to prayers and offerings of libations some of them subsisted on water some on air some lived on fallen leaves some on fruits and roots the hermitage looked bedecked with valakhilyas born from vala of brahma and vaikhanasas born from the nails of brahma
highly powerful viswamitra foremost among the conquerors thus saw the hermitage of vasishta which looked like another brahmaloka     thus ends the fiftyfirst sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
overwhelmed with joy the mighty heroic viswamitra upon seeing vasishta the greatest among ascetics was and offered respectful salutations
adorable vasishta received viswamitra with words of welcome and ordered a seat for him
with the sagacious viswamitra seated the great ascetic duly offered him fruits and roots
foremost among kings the brilliant viswamitra having received hospitality from vasishta enquired about his welbeing his austerities his firesacrifices his disciples and trees in his hermitage vasishta too informed him of the welfare of all
vasishta son of brahma the greatest among those who recite prayers and possess rich asceticism enquired of king viswamitra comfortably seated before him
o king is it all well with you o righteous one o heroic one are you ruling your subjects in accordance with the duties enjoined upon the king do you rule them in conformity with the code of moralit in order to make them happy
are your servants provided well with their requirements do they abide by your command o destroyer of foes have all your enemies been conquered
o tormentor of enemies o sinless one o tiger among men is it all well with your army treasury friends sons and grandsons
highly brilliant king viswamitra humbly informed vasishta that all was well
both the righteous personalities dwelt at length on various matters and interesting anecdotes with great delight and derived mutual pleasure
o descendent of raghu at the end of the conversation venerable vasishta smiling as it were said to viswamitra
o highy powerful viswamitra i wish to offer appropriate hospitality to you and to your incomparable army be pleased to accept it
please accept the honour i extend being a king you are a distinguished guest you deserve to be treated respectfully in all possible ways
to these words of vasishta the great intellectual viswamitra said you have spoken pleasing words this in itself is hospitality for me
o worshipful one o profoundly wise one you are worthy of homage you have excellently honoured me in all possible ways with whatever fruits and roots available in your hermitage with water for washing feet and for sipping you have permitted me darshan with your revered self i shall leave now my regards look upon me with eyes of friendship
as the king was addressing thus the righteous and generous vasishta repeatedly requested him to accept his hospitality
the son of gadhi said to vasishta o preeminent among sages be it so o venerable one they will be done
vasishta who was highly brilliant the greatest among those who meditate on brahman and free from sins was pleased thereafter he called the speckled cow kamadhenu
o sabala come on quick listen to my words i have decided to honour this royal saint and his army with excellent food make necessary arrangemets
o kamadhenu quickly entertain them for my sake with the food of six kinds of tastes varieties of rich dishes as desired by each
o sabala create at once all food items consisting of liquids and solids for drinking tasting and siping     thus ends the fiftysecond sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
o destroyer of foes rama addressed thus by vasishta the wishfulfilling sabala satisfied each ones desires
sugarcane honey and fried grain invigorating liquors in good containers excellent drinks and varieties of food were served
heaps of hot rice as high as mountains savoury food condiments and on abundance of curd various kinds of soups containers in their thousands completely filled with edibles with all six tastes and preparations made of jaggery were distributed
o rama vasistha entertained everybody in viswamitras army to their full satisfaction they were all wellfed and happy
king viswamitra along with ladies priests and brahmins including the royal sage were fully satisfied and delighted
having received the hospitality along with his counsellors ministers and attendants viswamitra filled with great delight said to vasishta
o brahman you are worthy of worship i was received with reverence and wellentertained by you o sage conversant with speech listen
i shall give you a hundred thousand cows in exchange for sabala o respectable one this cow is a gem a king along has a right on jewels o brahmin for that reason sabala rightfully belongs to me therefore give this cow
addressed the by viswamitra venerable and righteous vasishta who was of the earth ascetic replied
o king i shall not exchange sabala for a hundred thousand for even or a hundred crore cows or heaps of silver
o suppressor of enemies viswamitra it is not proper to separate this cow from me the relationship between sabala and me is permanent like the relationship between a righteous man and his fame
for havyam oblations to gods and kavyam oblations to ancestors for fulfilling the necessities of life maintenance of the sacred fire and offering oblations to all spirits of created beings and for offerings made to the firegod i depend on this cow
o royal saint swaha and vashat and various branches of learning are all dependent on this cow no doubt about it
this one is truly my whole possession it always gives me contentment o king for various reasons i will not give sabala to you
to there words of vasishta viswamitra who is skilful in conversation reacted with extreme excitement
i shall give fourteen thousand elephants with gold trappings around the neck and girth and with goads made of gold
i shall give you eight hundred chariots made of gold and decorated with small tinkling bells each chariot yoked with four white horses
o maharshi of auspicious vows i shall give you eleven thousand mighty horses of good breed born in good countries
i shall give one crore young cows of various colours give me sabala
o best of brahmins i shall offer you jewels or gold as much as you desire i shall give you everything give this sabala to me
to these words of sagacious viswamitra the adorable vasishta replied o king i shall not give sabala
this is verily my jewel my wealth my very life this is allinall for me
o king verily this sabala is useful for my darsa and purnamasa sacrifices for appropriate gifts and various rites
o king this cow is undoubtedly the source of all my actions why these useless words i will never give this wishfulfilling cow     thus ends the fiftythird sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
o rama when sage vasishta did not consent to part with the wishfulfilling cow viswamitra dragged sabala by force
o rama when she was being taken away by the powerful king the distressed sabala thus reflected choked with sorrow
i am being carried away by attendants of the king in this greatly distressed and pitiable condition have i been abandoned by the magnanimous vasishta
what harm have i done to the pious maharshi a compassionate soul why does he forsake me his auspicious one despite my innocence and devotion
o destroyer of enemies thus thinking and repeatedly sighing that cow shook off those attendants who were in hundreds and ran towards the feet of the illustrious vasishta with the speed of the wind
lowing and moaning standing before vasishta roaring like thunder and of kettledrum sabala said
o brahmas son o venerable one you have abandoned me for what reason the servants of the king are taking me away from you
addressed thus bramharshi said to sabala like to a sister whose heart is afflicted with sorrow
o sabala i am not forsaking you you have done me no harm this highly powerful king is forcibly carrying you away from me
i am no match for his strength especially he is a king being king he is a warrior powerful and lord of the earth
he has an entire akshauhini composed of horses chariots elephants and banners hence he is stonger
to these words of brahmarshi vasishta armed with immeasurable power sabala who knew the use of words replied with humility
o best of brahmins it is held that the strength of a kshatriya is no greater than a brahmins a brahmin possesses great strength his strength is divine it is greater than that of a kshatriya
your power is immeasurable even though highly valiant viswamitra is not greater than you in strength your power is unequalled
o highly fortunate one i am possessed of your brahminic power command me i will destroy the insolent and power of that wickedminded one
o rama to this glorious vasishta replied create an army capable of crushing the enemy power
hearing his words kamadhenu created an army o rama her lowing brought into being paplavas in hundreds who destroyed the entire army of viswamitra while he looked on helplessly
thereafter the king viswamitra having seen his army thus routed flew into a fury wideeyed with anger he sat in his chariot and destoyed the paplavas with various kinds of weapons
having seen hundreds of paplavas crushed by viswamitra once again she created out of anger sakas mixed with yavanas
sakas mixed with yavanas resembling golden filaments possessing brilliance and supreme bravery covered the earth
sakas and yavanas armed with swords and lances clad in yellow apparel looking like flaming fire destroyed the entire army
thereafter most brilliant viswamitra released weapons with these weapons the yavanas kambhojas and paplavas were scattered     thus ends the fiftyfourth sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
thereafter vasishta having seen the forces tortured and overpowered by the weapons of viswamitra said o kamadhenu create additional forces through your yogic power
from her lowing kambhojas bright like the sun from the udder paplavas weapons in hand from the vagina yavanas from the anus sakas from the roots of the hair mlecchas along with kiratas and haritas were born
o descendant of the raghus viswamitras army consisting of infantry elephants horses chariots has been entirely destroyed by them instantly
having seen the army destroyed by the powerful vasishta one hundred sons of viswamitra became extremely furious and armed with various kinds of weapons rushed towards vasishta the best among ascetics adorable sage vasishta reduced them to ashes with just a humkara the loud hum sound produced with the mouth
then one hundred sons of viswamitra together with their horses chariots and foot soldiers were reduced to ashes in a moment by the powerful vasishta
seeing his sons and army destroyed the illustrious viswamitra was filled with shame and anxiety
like the ocean without waves or the snake bereft of fangs or the sun eclipsed by rahu suddenly viswamitra looked cheerless and dull
having lost his sons and the army like a bird with wings clipped wretched with pride vanished and confidence shattered viswamitra fell into despondency
viswamitra having entrusted one of his remaining sons to rule the kingdom in accordance with the kshatriya tradition reached the forest
mighty ascetic viswamitra reached the slopes of the himavat mountain inhabited by kinnaras and uragas serpents and performed austerities in order to propitiate lord mahadeva
after some time lord of the gods bestower of boons maheswara with the symbol of the bull on the banner appeared before mighty viswamitra
o king what are you performing the penance for tell me what you want i am bestower of boons speak out you desire said lord siva
having heard this from the god viswamitra who performed the great austerities prostrated before mahadeva and said these words
o irreproachable one o mahadeva if you are pleased with me make me an expert in dhanurveda the science of archery with all it secrets angas branches upangas subdivisions and upanishads
o irreproachable one whatever weapons are known to devatas danavas maharshis gandharvas yakshas rakshasas be revealed to me
o lord of the gods by your favour let my desire be fulfilled lord mahadeva having said be it so vanished
rajarshi viswamitra endowed with supreme power became very haughty having obtained the weapons his insolence was greatly accentuated
like the sea during the full moon with his increased power blessed with the invincible strength of the weapons viswamitra thought the foremost of ascetics vasishta was already slain it shows the height of the kings ignorance and arrogance
thereafter king viswamitra having proceeded towards the hermitage of vasishta and released the weapons by the energy of which the entire forest of the ascetics was burnt down
on seeing the weapons discharged by the intelligent viswamitra saints in hundreds fled in all directions
the disciples of vasishta as well as animals and birds got terrified by the fear and fled in their thousands in all directions
the greatsoul vasishtas hermitage became deserted and silent in an instant like a barren field
even while vasistha was repeatedly assuring the saints saying do not fear i will now destroy viswamitra son of gadhi just as the sun dispels the morning mist they fled
the infuriated vasishta who was highly brilliant foremost among those who meditate said to viswamitra
o fool this hermitage has been developed over a long time why did you destroy it on account of your wickedness you will not live long
exceedingly furious vasishta quickly lifted up his staff which looked like the staff of yama the od of death like smokeless fire at the time of destruction of the worlds     thus ends the fiftyfifth sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
thus said vasishta mighty viswamitra lifted up agneya astra shaft of fire and discharging it said stay stay
venerable vasishta in fury lifted the brahmadanda which was like another rod of death and spoke these words
o wicked kshatriya o son of gadhi here i stand show me your strength and the pride of your arms i will destroy them now
o mean kshatriya where does your energy of a kshatriya stand in comparison with the great energy of brahma behold my brahmabala brahmans energy
the brahmadanda released by vasishta put down the dreadful agneya astra released by gadhis son just like the force of fire is extinguished by water
the incensed son of gadhi employed varuna raudra aindra pasupata and aishika weapons
o descendent of raghu viswamitra employed weapons like manava mohana gandharva swapana jrimbhana madana santapana vilapana shoshana darana vajra weapons brahma kala and varuna pasas the favourite painaka daita shushka ardra vajras danda paisacha krauncha weapons dharmachakra kalachakra vishnuchakras vayavya mathana hayasira weapons kanakala musala powers vaidyadhara kalatrishula kapala kankana weapons discharged against vasishta the best of ascetics all this became aweful
o descendent of raghu viswamitra employed weapons like manava mohana gandharva swapana jrimbhana madana santapana vilapana shoshana darana vajra weapons brahma kala and varuna pasas the favourite painaka daita shushka ardra vajras danda paisacha krauncha weapons dharmachakra kalachakra vishnuchakras vayavya mathana hayasira weapons kanakala musala powers vaidyadhara kalatrishula kapala kankana weapons discharged against vasishta the best of ascetics all this became aweful
vasishta son of brahma swallowed all those weapons with his staff when those weapons were humbled son of gadhi employed brahmastra
all the devatas with agni in the forefront divine rishis great uragas and gandharvas were agitated seeing the brahmastra raised when brahmastra was discharged the three worlds became distressed
o descendant of raghu vasishta who possessed the energy of brahma swallowed that very dreadful brahmastra entirely with the help of brahmadanda
while swallowing brahmastra the great vasishta looked fierce and terrible causing the three worlds to faint
from every pore of the great vasishtas body flames resembling rays of light with smoke emerged
the staff of brahma in vasishtas hand resembling smokeless fire at the end of the dissolution of the worlds inflamed like another rod of death
then hosts of saints praised vasishta the best among sages saying o brahmin your energy is infallible hold your energy by your enegy
o brahman great ascetic viswamitra was controlled by you o best of ascetics be pleased and let the worlds be delivered from distress
at this vasishta the most brilliant ascetic became quiet the humiliated viswamitra heaved a sigh and spoke these words
shame where is the might of a kshatriya the energy of a brahmin is the real energy the staff of brahma has singly destroyed all my weapons
now i have realised the reason with clear mind and senses i shall undertake intense penance which will earn me brahminhood     thus ends the fiftysixth sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
o descendant of raghu rama having created enmity between himself and the magnanimous vasishta viswamitra recollecting the disgrace and repeatedly sighing with a distressed heart went with his eldest wife towards southern quarter to perform rigorous penance subsisting on fruits and roots and his senses underfull control he performed the most rigid austerities
after some time four sons havishyanda madhushyanda drudhanetra and maharatha who later wer wedded to truth and duty were born
a thousand years passed the grandsire of the worlds brahma appeared he spoke to viswamitra the great ascetic these pleasant words
o son of kushika with your austerities you have won the worlds of the rajarshis on account of your austerities you are acknowledged a rajarshi
having said this the glorious brahma supreme lord of the worlds left for his abode in brahmaloka in heaven accompanied by the gods
on hearing this viswamitra hanging down his face a little with shame and anger and grief said
i have performed intense austerities yet rishis and devatas have recognised me only as a rajarshi i think my penance has yielded fruit
o descendant of kakustha rama this celebrated intellectual having decided in his mind once again performed greater austerities
at this time there lived a celebrated king renowned in the ikshvakus race named trisanku who was truthful and self restrained
o son of the raghus rama a thought arose in his mind to enter heaven with his physical body by performing a sacrifice
summoning vasishta he trisahnku communicated his intention but the great vasishta said it was not possible
refused by vasishta the king went south in order to fulfil his purpose and approached vasishtas sons
most brilliant trisanku approached the sons of vasishta in the place where they had been performing austerities for a long time there he saw the famous exceedingly effulgent sons of vasishta one hundred in number practising penance
the king having approached all the illustrious sons of his spiritual guide paid obeisance to them in order of seniority bowing down his face in humility and with folded palms he addressed all those distinguished sons of vasishta saying
o protectors of those who seek refuge in you protect me wish you well i have been refused by the great vasishta
i wish to perform a great sacrifice you are worthy enough to tender your consent i pay homage to all the sons of my spiritual guide oblige
you brahmins are established in austerity i bow to you i beg all of you to direct me with composed minds to direct me in order to attain heaven in physical form
o ascetocs after having been rejected by vasishta i do not see any way other than the sons of my spiritual guide to help me achieve my purpose
for all the descendants of ikshvakus the spiritual preceptor is the supreme resort for salvation learned spiritual preceptors have always liberated kings hence you are all gods to me only next to vasishta     thus ends the fiftyseventh sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
o rama to these words of king trisanku the hundred sons of the sage angrily reacted
o evilminded one having been refused by the guru true to his word how could you bypass him and approach us who are mere off shoots of the main
for all the kings of the ikshvakus race their chief priest is their guru it is not possible to bypass the spiritual preceptor who is true to his word preceptor
when an adorable sage like vasishta has already said it is not possible how can we help you conduct such a sacrifice
o best one among men you are childish return to your capital o monarch the most venerable vasishta is capable of conducting sacrifices performed by anybody in the three worlds how can we dishonour him
having heard the confused words uttered by the sages in a state of anger the king said again
o men endowed with the wealth of asceticism i was rejected by my guru and now by his sons i shall seek another way farewell to you
having seen his fierce intent the saints sons were infuriated they cursed him saying be a chandala
with this the highsouled sons of vasishta entered their hermitage and one night after the king became a chandala a lowcaste man
the king was tranformed into a darkcomplexioned dirty man with dishevelled hair his body was besmeared with ashes and on his robes lay wreath collected from the cemetery he had on him dark soiled clothes and ornaments made of iron
o rama seeing him in the form of a chandala all his counsellors inhabitants of the city including his followers fled away
o descendant of kakustha wandering alone burning with distress night and day the king went to viswamitra who was rich in asceticism
o rama on seeing the king reduced to a useless a chandala sage viswamitra was touched with pity
exceedingly energetic and deeply pious he looked at the king who was frightful in appearance and addressed him with compassion saying welfare to you
o mighty prince what brings your here for you are the heroic lord of ayodhya whose curse turned you into a chandala
in response to his words the king who had fallen into the state of a chandala yet proficient in expression spoke to one viswamitra expert in speech with folded hands
rejected by my guru and his sons what i achieved was disaster and what i could not was the fulfilment of my wish
o gentle sage it is my intention to enter heaven with my physical body i performed a hundred sacrifices but did not reap its fruit
o gentle sage i have never told a lie in spite of troubled circumstances i shall never dabble in falsehood i swear upon it by kshatriya morality
i have performed various sacirifices and ruled over my people guided by the law of righteousness i have pleased eminent elders with my conduct and character
o preeminent among sages i endeavour to do my duty i intend to perform a sacrifice my gurus do not appreciate this
i consider destiny to be allpowerful the effort of a man goes in vain everything is controlled by destiny it is the supreme resort
my merits have been destroyed by destiny deeply afflicted i crave a favour from you you are fit to grant it wish you well
i will not take refuge in anybody there is no other protector for me you are capable of averting my reverses in fate with human effort      thus ends the fiftyeighth sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
what the king said was proved by his chandala form which the son of kushika viswamitra heard and out of compassion spoke these sweet words
o descendant of ikshvakus o child welcome i know you as highly righteous o eminent among kings fear not i offer you refuge
o king i shall invite pious maharshis to assist you in the sacrifice which you will be able to perform with great relief
with the present physical body disfigured by the curse of your spiritual preceptor you shall go to heaven
o king since you have taken refuge in viswamitra who is the protector of those who resort to him i think heaven is already within your reach
most brilliant viswamitra having thus spoken ordered his deeply religious and highly learned sons to make preparations for the sacrifice
he summoned all his disciples and said children bring here hosts of rishis along with their disciples and friends officiating priests and persons wellversed in the srutis this is my order
if any one should speak with disrespect in response to my order you may report the matter to me in full
at his command the disciples set out in different directions and as a result expounders of the vedas began arriving from various countries
all the disciples on their return communicated to the sage shining in splendour what the expounders of the vedas had said
having heard your words all brahmins except mahodaya have arrived from all countries
o preeminent among ascetics here is what the hundred sons of vasishta spoke in anger
when a kshatriya acts as a priest for the sacrifice particularly for a chandala how can gods and sages partake the offerings
joining viswamitra in chanting the mantras during the yaga how will the great brahmins attain heaven after partaking the food offered by of chandala
o best among ascetics all the sons of vasishta along with mahodaya with their eyes reddened in anger spoke these harsh words
on hearing the words of the hundred sons of vasishta uttered in anger viswamitra preeminent among ascetics spoke furiously with eyes reddened in anger
i am blameless i have practised rigorous penance these wicked ones who have abused a sage like me will be reduced to ashes
caught by the noose of death this day they shall be brought to the abode of yama and for seven hundred births feed on corpses
reborn as the merciless race of mushtikas feeding on the flesh of dogs hideous and deformed they shall wander in these worlds
the wicked mahodaya who blamed a sage like me so faultless shall be reborn in the race of the nishadas vulnerable to abuse by all
as a consequence of my anger that mahodaya devoid of mercy and taking pleasure in depriving others of their life will pursue a wretched life for a long time
the most powerful sage viswamitra of fierce asceticism fell silent after after uttering this curse in the assembly of rishis     thus ends the fiftyninth sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
the most brilliant viswamitra having destroyed the sons of vasishta including mahodaya by his ascetic power said this in the midst of saints
this religious and generous king born in the ikshvaku race wellknown as trisanku sought my refuge to gain heaven with his physical body
join me in the performance of this sacrifice in a manner by which he trisanku attains heaven with his physical body
agreeing to these words of viswamitra all the rishis knowers of spiritual order and endowed with righteousness assembled there said
born in the line of kusika this sage is extremely cholerictempered whatever he says must be properly carried out there should be no resitation on this score the venerable sage is like fire he will curse us if angered
hence let the sacrifice be performed in such a manner that the descendant of the ikshvakus would attain heaven with his physical body through the spiritual power of viswamitra all of you commence the sacrifice
the maharshis having resolved performed their respective activities relating to the sacrifice the brilliant viswamitra acted as the chief officiating priest
the officiating priests proficient in chanting mantras performed in order of their respective ranks all the rites in accordance with the yojanakalpa adhering to codes and traditions
long after the mighty ascetic viswamitra invoked all the gods to partake their share of offerings
when the gods invited by him did not come to receive their share of offerings the great ascetic viswamitra seized with anger lifted the sacrificial ladle and said to trisanku
o king behold the prowess of my selfearned asceticism with my spiritual might i shall send you to heaven with your physical body o king go to heaven with physical body which is not possible for anybody to accomplish
by the power of what little fruit of austerities i have earned i shall send to heaven with your body
o descendant of kakustha rama when the sage had said these words the king with his physical body ascended to heaven in the presence of the sages
on ascending to heaven trisanku saw indra destroyer of paka along with hosts of gods indra said to him
o trisanku you are not fit to inhabit heaven go back you fool doomed by the curse of your spiritual preceptor fall on earth head down
thus spoken to by indra trisanku crying o viswamitra protect me protect me started falling down
having heard the wailing trisanku the enraged viswamitra shouted stay stay
standing in the midst of the ascetics that mighty sage who conjured up a constellation of seven new rishis stars looked like another creator brahma overcome by anger the illustrious sage created a new group of stars in the southern direction
having created a constellation of stars viswamitra out of anger said i will create another indra or this world will be without indra and commenced to create even gods
struck with wonder and fear hosts of rishis suras and asuras humbly addressed viswamitra
o glorious maharshi this king cursed by his spiritual preceptor is not worthy of going to heaven with his physical body
the son of kushika viswamitra the preeminent ascetic heard the gods and said these praiseworthy words
i wish you well having promised king trisanku ascent to heaven with his physical form i do not wish to go back on my word
let this heaven be an eternal abode for trisanku in his physical form all these stars created by me shall endure as long as the worlds survive o gods it behoves of you to accord consent to this
thus addressed all the gods replied to the preeminent ascetic o best among sages be blessed let thy will be donel those many celebrated stars shall stay on all sides outside the path of vaisvanara zodiac in the firmament amidst those stars trisanku shining brilliantly like an immortal shall stay on head down
these stars will follow this illustrious one trisanku the best of kings who gained his object as if he had attained heaven
in this manner extolled by all devatas and rishis mighty and righteous viswamitra said well let it be so
o best among men rama then at the conclusion of the sacrifice the great gods and saints went the way they had come     thus ends the sixtieth sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
o tiger among men rama thereafter great viswamitra seeing the departing sages of the forest said
o highsouled sages there is lake pushkara in the vast western region there in the forest fit for austerities we shall practise penance peacefully
with this the most powerful sage viswamitra reached pushkara where living on fruits and roots he carried out intense unsurpassable austerities
at this time ambarisha a wellknown king of ayodhya launched preparations for a sacrifice
while he was performing the sacrifice indra stole away the sacrificial animal the animal could not be traced hence the priest said to the king
o king the animal has been stolen away and because of your inability to enforce law it could not be traced o lord of men the king who fails to protect his dependents perishes by his own faults
o best of men you must pay a big price for this bring either the beast or a man immediately so that the sacrifice can be completed
o best of men rama hearing the words of the high priest the highly intellectual king searched for a human victim in exchange for thousands of cows
o dear rama the delight of raghu clan the king scoured countries villages cities forests sacred hermitages till he saw sage richika in the bhrigutunda mountain sitting with his sons and wie
the most brilliant kingambarisha bowing to sage richika a brahmarshi who looked extremely resplendent with penance propitiated him enquired about the welfare of all and finally said
o fortunate descendent of the bhrigu race if your son is sold as a sacrificial animal in exchange for a hundred thousand cows my purpose will be answered
i have roamed all countries but could not final the sacrificial animal shouldnt you spare one of your sons for a price
thus addressed the exceedingly brilliant richika said o best among men in no way shall i sell my first born
having heard richika the miserable mother of great sons addressed ambarisha the foremost of men saying
venerable descendant of the bhrugus sage richika said that the eldest son cannot be sold o king the youngest son sunaka is my beloved son you know o king for that reason i will not give my yougest son
o best among men generally the eldest sons are the favourites of their fathers the youngest their mothers for that reason i shall keep my youngest son
o rama the sage and his wife having spoken thus their middle son sunassepha said on his own
o king my father says his eldest son cannot be sold mother says that her youngest son cannot be spared from this i think middle son is already sold away therefore take me
o delight of the raghus rama having purchased sunassepha for a hundred thousands of cows the king refurned immensely pleased
o foremost of men o delight of the raghus rama the illustrious king ambarisha took sunassepha with him on the way at pushkara he took some rest at noon
while the king was resting at pushkara the famous sunassepha very much distressed happened to see his maternal uncle viswamitra in the company of other sages performing austerities
with his face discoloured due to thirst and fatigue he sunassepha immediately fell into the sages lap in a pitiable condition and said
o noble man o preeminent among ascetics i have no mother nor father nor friends nor relatives you should protect me according to dharma
o best among ascetics you are the protecor of everybody you are promoter of others welfare may the king fulfil his purpose may i live long and become immortal and attain heaven after performing great penance may i enjoy heaven
o virtuous one with a kind heart protect this orphan like a father who protects his son save me from this peril
having heard sunassepha mighty ascetic viswamitra consoled him in many ways and said to his sons
o sons of the sage this young boy has sought my protection o sons you may grant him his desire by merely offering your life
engaged in the observance of righteousness all of you have done virtuous deeds by becoming sacrificial animals for the king you may satisfy agni
then sunassepha will be protected the kings sacrifice will continue without hindrance the gods will be gratified my words also will come true
o best of men rama in response to the words of the sage madhuchanda and others said thus in a casual way with selfesteem
o lord protecting others son by abandoning one own is like partaking the flesh of a dog we consider it a prohibited act
on hearing the words of his sons viswamitra the eminent ascetic eyes reddened with anger began to speak
you have not only trangressed my words but also you are censurable according to dharma you have uttered such audacious and dreadrul words causing the hair to stand on end
all of you shall live on earth for a thousand years like the sons of vasishta feeding on the flesh of dogs
viswamitra the best of ascetics thus cursed his sons sunassepha now was filled with distress to relieve him of his pain he said
bedaubing your person with red sandal paste and adorned with red garlands you will be bound to a vaishnava sacrificial post with sacred ropes there invoke agni with these hymns
o son of sage chant thse two sacred mantras in the sacrifice of ambarishathere after you will achieve success long life
sunassepha memorized the two verses with concentration of mind and hastened towards amabarisha a lion among kings and said
endowed with great strength you are a lion among kings we shall go to the sacrificial assembly without delay o indra among monarchs take up initiatory rites and perform the sacrifice
at the words of the sages son the king eager with delight hastened towards the sacrificial ground
with the consent of the officiating priests the king invested sunasepha with the sacred symbols with kusa grass dressed him in red apparel and tied him to the sacrificial post as a sacrificial animal
thus bound the son of the sage praised the two devatas indra and upendra with moving words
o descendant of raghu rama indra gratified with the secret hymn granted sunassepha long life
o foremost of men o rama the king also obtained from the sacrifics innumerable rewards by the grace of indra several times greater than expected
o best among men the righteous and mighty ascetic viswamitra also continued his austerities at pushkara for a thousand years     thus ends the sixtysecond sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
all the gods wanted to bestow the fruits of austerties on the mighty ascetic viswamitra they approached him after a thousand years of penace and his final ritual bath
exceedingly effulgent brahma spoke to him you have become a rishi through the selfearned sacred deeds fare you well
brahma the lord of the gods having said this returned to heaven the brilliant viswamitra continues his austerities
o foremost of men after a long lapse of time a chief nymph called menaka came to bathe at pushkara
there the most brilliant son of kusika viswamitra saw menaka whose beauty was incomparable she looked like lightning in the clouds
on seeing her menaka viswamitra came under the influence of the god of love fell in love with her he said o apsara welcome to my hermitage stay here i am infatuated with you oblige me wish you well
o descendant of raghu while that woman of an exalted race lived in the hermitage of viswamitra ten years rolled by happily
as the period passed viswamitra the mighty ascetic was filled with grief anxiety and remorse
o delight of the raghus rama a sense of indignation filled the mind of the ascetic all this is the conspiracy of the gods to deprive me of my great austerities he thought
night and day deluded by lust i have wasted ten years a hindrance has been posed to my tapas
o rama viswamitra the best of ascetics sighed with repentance distressed with grief on seeing him the apsara started trembling in fear she stood before him with folded palms but with sweet words the son of kushika left her and proceeded towards the northern mountains
illustrious viswamitra took a vow of celibacy in order to control his senses and performed rigid austerities on reaching the bank of river kausiki
o rama while he was performing rigorous penance for a thousand years on the northern mountains the gods were gripped with fear lest he should exceed them
after consultations the gods and sages decided that this son of kushika viswamitra deserved the status of a maharshi
having heard the gods the grandsire of the worlds brahma addressed viswamitra whose wealth was his ascetism in these sweet words
o maharshi o child welcome pleased with your intense austerities o son of kushika i confer upon you the eminent rank of a great rishi maharshi
having heard the words brahman the lord of all the worlds viswamitra whose wealth was his asceticism was neither dejected nor delighted
then the mighty ascetic viswamitra bowed to brahma the grandsire of all the worlds with folded hands and replied
o adorable one if you have conferred the incomparable title of maharshi earned by my auspicious deeds i feel i have conquered the senses
then brahma said to him you have not conquered the senses yet o tiger among ascetics strive still having said this he went toward heaven
after the departure of the gods mighty ascetic viswamitra raised his arms up stood without support subsisting on air continuing with his austerities
viswamitra whose wealth was his penance carried on his rigid austerities for a thousand years amidst five fires in summer under the open sky in monsoon and immersed in ater night and day in winter
when the mighty asetic viswamitra was peforming penance the gods as well as indra got deeply perturbed
indra along with all the maruts spoke to the celestial nymph rambha words that augured well for them and not for kaushika viswamitra     thus ends the sixtythird sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
o rambha you must entice viswamitra by lust and passion this important work must be done by you in the interest of the gods
o rama to these words of the sagacious thousandeyed lord of the gods indra that apsara with folded hands bashfully replied
lord of the devatas this mighty ascetic viswamitra is a terrible person he will ceratinly release on his dreadful anger curse me o lord this is my apprehension you should excuse me
o rama having heard rambha trembling in fear and standing with folded palms indra spoke
o rambha have no fear feel safe carry out my order when the trees look so beautiful in spring i shall in captivating the form of a cuckoo stay by your side in the company of kamadeva cupid
o rambha displaying many romantic gestures and assuming a fascinating form distract the mighty ascetic kausika viswamitra
at these words of indra rambha assumed any form of excellent beauty and with a bright smile set out to allure viswamitra
excited by the charming warble of the cuckoo viswamitra opened his eyes
on hearing the sound of the incomparable song of the cuckoo along with the sight of rambha a doubt arose in the mind of the ascetic
son of kushika the eminent ascetic knew it was the work of indra seized with anger he cursed rambha
o luckless rambha since you have endeavoured to distract me from my desire to conquer wrath and passion you shall turn into a rock and remain so for ten thousand years
o rambha an effulgent brahmin endowed with the power of asceticism will liberate you from this state into which you have fallen on account of my anger
the brilliant viswamitra the great ascetic now experienced remorse for his inability to contain anger
this mighty curse of the great saint transformed rambha into a rock and sent kamadeva and indra to their heels
o rama highly powerful viswamitra was deprived of his ascetic merit due to his anger he had no peace of mind for his inability to control his senses
having been deprived of his ascetic merit he resolved not to lose his temper nor ever breathe a word
further i shall not even inhale for hundreds of years i shall conquer my senses and dry up this body
until brahminhood is obtained by my austerities i shall stay without breathing or eating for innumerable years while performing penance my limbs shall not undergo deterioration
o descendant of raghu in this way that eminent ascetic took an unprecedented vow to practise penance for a thousand years       thus ends the sixtyfourth sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
o rama thereafter the great ascetic viswamitra abandoning the north of the himavat mountain reached the eastern quarter and performed rigorous austerities
having observed a unique vow of silence for a thousand years o rama he practised unprecedented and extremely difficult austerities
after completion of a thousand years the great ascetic became a piece of wood in spite of many impediments he was unshaken anger did not enter into his mind o rama with firm determination he practised austerities
o best of raghus dynasty rama when the thousandyearold vow was over viswamitra the great practitioner of vows began to partake cooked rice at this moment indra assumed the guise of a brahmin and asked him for the rice he was going to eat
this mighty adorable ascetic having adopted a vow of silence decided to give all the cooked rice to the brahmin the brahmin finished all the rice viswamitra went without food but did not utter a single word to the brahmin thereafter the distinguished ascetic practised austerities for another period of thousand years his breath suspended
while his breath was suspended smoke emanated from his head which frightened the three worlds it appeared as though they were on fire
thereupon devatas along with gandharvas pannagas uragas and rakshasas stood bewildered by his ascetic energy their own glory was dimmed in his lustre afflicted with anguish they spoke to the grandsire brahma
o lord the great sage viswamitra was lured and angered in various ways but his austerities continued to grow
his penance was flawless if his wishes were not granted he will surely destroy by his austerities the three worlds with all movables and immovables
there is bewilderment everywhere it is dark all over the oceans are disturbed the mountains have cracked
o brahma the earth trembles the wind blows fiercely the people have ceased to believe in god we do not know the way out
the people of all the three worlds are agitated and confused in mind the sun too looks pale before the brilliance of the maharshi
o lord before this mighty venerable ascetic effulgent like fire decides to destroy the three worlds he should be appeased
all the three worlds are burning as though with the fire pralaya dissolution his desire may be granted even if he wants to rule the kingdom of the gods
thereafter with brahma in the forefront the gods spoke to viswamitra in pleasing words
welcome o brahmarshi we are immensely pleased with your austerities o kausika you have attained brahminhood by means of your intense penance
o brahmana i along with the maruts grant you long life may you prosper o gentle one now you may go happily
mighty ascetic viswamitra was delighted to hear the words of the grandsire and the gods bowing to all of them he thus spoke
if brahminhood and long life have been acquired by me by your grace omkara vashatkara and the vedas shall accept me as brahmarshi i shall acquire the right to interpret the vedas and to perform sacrifices
o gods let the son of brahma and eminent vasishta who is knowledgeable in the vedas worthy of brahmins and archery worthy of kshatriyas address me as brahmarshi if this supreme desire is granted o best of devatas all of you can go
thereupon pleased by the gods vasishta the best among ascetics lovingly said to viswamitra you are a brahmarshi let it be so
you are a brahmarshi no doubt you will achieve ascetic perfection said the gods and returned to their respective places from where they had come
virtuous viswamitra also having attained excellent brahminhood worshipped brahmrshi vasishta who was the best of those who recite hymns
this illustrious sage having fulfilled his desire wandered over the earth fixed in asceticism o rama thus he acquired brahminhood
o rama he is the foremost of ascetics an embodiment of asceticism always intent on virtue he is the ultimate repository of ascetic energy
having thus spoken the most brilliant and best among brahmins satananda became silent in the presence of rama and lakshmana janaka listened to the words of satananda and with folded palms said to the son of kushika viswamitra
o righteous one o preeminent among ascetics you have come to my sacrifice accompanied by the descendants of kakustha rama and lakshmana i am blessed by your presence and am highly favoured
o excellent ascetic o brahmana i am sanctified with your presence i have derived immense benefits from your visit
o powerful brahmarshi distinguished rama and i have heard your great austerities which were related in detail by satananda
many of your virtues have been heard by the members of the assembly present at the sacrifice your austerities are immeasurable your power is immense o son of kushika viswamitra your virtues cannot be measured
o lord i am never tired of listening to your marvellous deeds o excellent among ascetics the sun has set and it is time for evening prayers
o sage of great austerities come to me tomorrow at dawn o excellent ascetic welcome and allow me to leave
the day dawned bright and clear when the king janaka performed his daily routine rites and welcomed the great viswamitra with the two raghavas rama and lakshmana
the virtuous janaka paid respects to viswamitra and the highsouled rama and lakshmana in accordance with the sastras and spoke
welcome o venerable one o irreproachable one what can i do for you worthy of being commanded i seek your orders
at the words of the magnanimous janaka the virtuous sage wellversed in speech replied to the heroic king
dasarathas sons rama and lakshmana kshatriyas renowned in the world are eager to see that great bow in your possession
thus addressed by the mighty ascetic janaka replied i shall tell you how this bow came to be deposited here
o adorable one there was a famous king named devarata sixth in line from nimi this bow was kept with him in trust by the exalted lord shiva
earlier at the time of destruction of dakshas sacrifice rudra endowed with great prowess lifted this bow sportively and spoke to the gods
o gods in your anxiety to partake your share of the sacrifie you have failed to provide mine in the sacrificial offerings therefore i shall sever your jewelled heads and beautiful limbs with this bow
o eminent ascetic thereafter all the gods with agitated minds propitiated lord of the gods siva and he was pleased with them
o lord that gem of a bow belonging to siva was given to the great gods who in turn got it deposited in trust with our ancestor
thereupon while i was ploughing and cleaing the sacrificial ground sita a wellknown name was lifted up by the blade of the plough thus she was obtained by me
arisen from the earth and not from a mothers womb she grew up as my daughter i made a stipulation that this shall be the means to win this maiden as a gift this shall be given in marriage only to the prince whose prowess is fully tried
o eminent ascetic arisen from the earth and reared as my daughter she has been sought after in marriage by many princes
o worshipful one all those monarchs sought this maiden but i did not offer my daughter saying that the marriage offer could be made only through the tried and tested prowess of a suitor
o preeminent among ascetics thereafter many kings together came to mithila to test their prowess
the bow was brought and placed before those who were curious to test their strength but none was able to grasp or lift the bow
o great ascetic i knew those mighty kings had little strength so rejected them
o mighty ascetic thereafter all the kings doubting their own strength in stringing the bow were inflamed with anger and laid siege on mithila
those eminent kings felt humiliated inflamed with anger they tormented the city of mithila
o best among ascetics thus one year passed everywhere in the city all the means of living were exhausted i felt deeply sad over this situation
thereafter i propitiated the gods by my austerities highly pleased they gave me an army of four divisions chariots elephants horses and infantry
then those wicked kings who were exhausted were doubtful about their energy they were beaten and defeated they fled away along with their ministers in different directions
o sage you are a tiger among asceties you are faithful to your vows i shall show this effulgent bow to your rama and lakshmana
o sage if rama could lift and string this bow i shall give my daughter sita not born from a woman to him son of dasaratha      thus ends the sixtysixth sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
at the words of janaka great ascetic viswamitra said to the king let the bow be shown to rama
thereafter king janaka said to his feudatories let the divine bow adorned with flowers and sandalpaste be brought
commanded by king janaka the ministers went to the city put the bow in front of them and carried it as per the orders of the king
five thousand mighty stalwarts drew with great difficulty the eightwheeled cart on which the bow was placed in a box
the counsellors of the king brought the iron casket containing the bow and said these words to janaka comparable to a celestial
o indra among kings o lord of mithila here is the great bow worshipped by all kings which you intend to show to rama
having heard this the king with folded hands said to the great soul viswamitra sitting with the two princes rama and lakshmana
o brahman in the olden days this great bow was worshipped by my forefathers powerful kings failed to string this bow
hosts of devatas asuras rakhasas kinnaras and great serpents the best of gandharvas and yakshas also failed to wield this bow
how then can men bend string fix the arrow pull the string and lift it
o eminent ascetic such heaviest bow is brought here o highly accomplished sage show this to the two princes
having heard the words of janaka the righteous viswamitra said o child o descendant of raghu look at this bow
at the words of the great rishi viswamitra rama opened the casket beheld the bow and said
o brahmarshi shall i touch this great bow with my hands lift and string it
the king as also the rishi said be it so at the words of the sage viswamitra he rama took hold of the bow by the its middle with ease
virtuous rama the delight of the raghus in the presence of several thousands of men fixed the string to the bow and drew it as though with ease
rama the best among men righteous and famous lifted the bow stringing it with a twang he drew it and broke it into two in the middle
it generated a loud sound like the clap of thunder like the trembling of the earth and the splitting of a mountain
on hearing the sound except janaka viswamitra and the two raghavas rama and lakshmana the rest of the people around fell down and fainted
when the people recovered the king skilful in the use of words addressed the eminent ascetic without apprehension with folded palms in the following words
o worshipful one i have witnessed the prowess of rama son of dasaratha i had not imagined that this marvellous feat could be ever accomplished
by receiving rama son of dasaratha as her husband my daughter sita will bring glory to my dynasty
o son of kausika i announce sita to be the reward of prowess my vow has come true she is more valuable than my life and fit to be given to rama

the welfare of the descendant of kausika rama and lakshmana under the protection of sage viswamitra be reported to the king the king who will be happy to hear this be brought here by swiftfooted men
the son of kausika viswamitra also said so be it the virtuous king having consulted his ministers despatched counsellors to ayodhya to communicate to king dasaratha all that had taken place and bring him to mithila     thus ends the sixtyseventh sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
commanded by janaka the messengers travelled for three days rested for three nights on the way and entered the city of ayodhya along with their horses tired
reaching the kings palace the messengers said to the doorkeepers let king dasaratha be immediately informed that the messengers from janaka have come
having heard their words the doorkeepers informed the descendant of raghu king dasaratha thereafter with the the kings permission the messengers entered the royal palace and beheld the aged king dasaratha who shone like a god
all the messengers hands folded free from apprehensions reverentially addressed the king in sweet words
o great monarch mithilas lord king janaka with the sacred fire in front again and again enquires about your health and the spiritual wellbeing of your preceptors priests and attendants in words filled with sweetness and affection
janaka the king of mithila with the enquiry about your welfare with the permission of the son of kausika viswamitra sends you this message
o king it is wellknown that formerly i had vowed to give my daughter to a groom as a reward for prowess disappointed when proved powerless the kings became indignant and opposed me

the king of videha janaka with viswamitras approval and in line with satanandas thinking has conveyed these sweet words the messengers having said so concluded out of respect for their king afraid that they might look overtalkative
exceedingly happy to hear the words of the messengers the king said to vasishta vamadeva and other ministers
the enhancer of the joy of kausalya rama along with hs brother lakshmana under the protection of viswamitra is now staying in the coutry of the videhas
illustrious janaka desires to bestow his daughter on the descendat of kakustha rama whose prowess he has witnessed
if you approve the action of the distinguished janaka let us hurry to the city of mithila let there be no delay
with the passing of the night king dasaratha accompanied by spiritual preceptors and relatives said to sumantra
let all the officers of the treasury furnished with enough wealth and a variety gems go in advance under escort
let the four divisions of the army from all the four quarters with elegant palanquins proceed at my command
let brahmins like vasishta vamadeva jabali kasyapa markandeya endowed with long life and rishi katyayana depart in advance my chariot be yoked and kept ready let there be no delay the messengers from janaka are hastening me up
while the indra among kings dasaratha proceeded with the sages the four divisions of the army followed them at the command of the king
covering the distance in four days they arrived in the country of the videhas the fortunate king janaka having heard about these tidings made arangements to extend to them reverential hospitality

o foremost of men o best of kings tomorrow at dawn after the completion of the sacrifice you should perform the marriage with approval by the sages
at these words the most eloquent king dasaratha made his reply in the midst of sages
i have heard that acceptance of a gift from the righteous is a pleasure so we will act upon your word
janaka was filled with extreme admiration to hear one who was truthful righteous and famous this dasaratha
thereupon hosts of sages in one anothers company filled with great delight spent the night comfortably
the king dasaratha was greatly delighted on being reunited with his sons rama and lakshmana honoured by janaka he spent the night with supreme satisfaction
mighty philosopher janaka also performed the sacrificial rites and spent the night there where the sacrificial ceremony was performed with both his daughters      thus ends the sixtynineth sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
thereafter at dawn after the maharshis had performed their daily sacrificial rites the eloquent janaka said to the chief priest satananda
the extremely righteous renowned and most brilliant kusadhwaja my younger brother is at present ruling the sacred kingdom of sankasya which is like the aerial chariot pushpaka with darts planted in water as boundary on the bank of the auspicious sacred river ikshumati
i desire to see kusadhwaja who i have accepted as the protector of the sacrifice i want that my glorious brother should share this pleasure with me
janaka having said so in the presence of satananda gave instructions to a few faithful attendants who were present
in obedience to the command of indra among men king janaka the messengers rode away on swift horses to bring king kusadhwaja a tiger among men just like fetching visnu by the orders of indra
the messengers reached sankasya met kusadhwaja and related to him what had happened they informed him the intention of king janaka
kusadhwaja having heard the events from the loyal mighty messengers set out for mithila in compliance with the request of the king janaka
there he saw the highsouled janaka devoted to righteousness having paid his regards to satananda and the virtuous king he occupied an exalted seat befitting a king
the two heroic brothers endowed with great splendour seated beside each other despatched sudamana the wisest of ministers to dasaratha
o foremost among counsellors go speedily and bring along with his ministers and sons the invincible dasaratha of the ikshvakus dynasty whose splendour is immeasurable
having reached the tent he sudamana saw dasaratha perpetuator of the race of the raghus and bowing down his head said
o heroic lord of ayodhya janaka the lord of mithila desires to see you along with preceptors and priest
king dasaratha on hearing the words of the best of the counsellors reached the place where janaka was waiting with hosts of rishis and relations
the king dasaratha skilled in speech accompanied by counsellors and kins said to janakathe lord of the videhas
o great king venerable vasishta is the spiritual protector of the ikshvakus race and it is known that for all ceremonies he is our spokesman
having been permitted by viswamitra along with all maharshis virtuous vasishta will tell you in detail about my race
having said this amidst the best of men and the most distinguished among kings dasaratha remained silent then vasishta the venerable sage wellversed in speech spoke to the lord of videhas janaka in the midst of priests
from the unmanifest was born the eternal the constant the imperishable brahma to him was born marichi and to marichi kasyapa
kasyapa begot vivasvan and vivasvan manu ikshavaku was the son of manu otherwise called prajapati or vaivasvata
it may be noted that ikshvaku was the first ancestral king of ayodhya whose son was the wellknown glorious kukshi

the king asita who was a weakling was defeated in the conflict against the kings and was exiled along with his counsellors he lived at on the bhriguprasravana himavat mountain
it is said that his asitas two wives were pregnant one gave food mixed with poison to the other with the intention of destroying her embryo
at that time chyavana of the family of bhrigu liked to stay at himavat the great pleasant mountain
that the lotuseyed and highly accomplished kalindi offered herself for a son to chyavana who was glowing like a god
having approached the ascetic kalindi paid obeisance to him who said
o great lady a child of high prowess lustre and virtues is growing in your womb in a short time this glorious son carrying with him the poison administered to you will be born o lotuseyed lady do not grieve
this eldest queen who was a devoted wife afflicted with sorrow due to loss of her husband gave birth to a son by the grace of chyavana
since poison was given to her by her rival queen with the intention of destroying the embryo the son was born with poison and so came to be known as sagara
asamanja was the son of sagara and to him was born anshuman dilipa was the son of anshuman and father of bhagiratha
bhagiratha begot kakustha whose son was raghu powerful pravriddha was raghus son he became purushadaka cannibal on the curse of vasistha he grasped water in order to retaliate vasishta but was prevented by his wife the water fell on his feet and he came to be known as kalmashapada feet polluted with water samkhana was born to him

king nahusha was the son of ambarisha to nahusha was born yayati whose son was nabhaga
nabhagas son was aja aja was the father of dasaratha and dasaratha the father of rama and lakshmana
vasishta having thus described the genealogy of dasaratha janaka with folded hands rejoined be blessed let me relate the genealogy of my race listen
o great sage o best of ascetics while one offers his daughter in marriage one born in a noble family should describe his genealogy in full listen
there was a great man of religion king nimi strongest of men and wellknown in the three worlds by his own acts

a little later a powerful king named sudhanva from the city of sankasya beseiged mithila
he sudhanva sent me a message give me the great bow of siva and the lotuseyed maiden sita
o brahmarshi when i refused a great conflict broke out between him and me in the encounter king sudhanva was killed by me

today the star makha is on the ascendant o king perform the marriage on the third day from today under uttaraphalguni star gifts may be given for the happiness of rama and lakshmana     thus ends the seventyfirst sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
when janaka the valiant king of videha thus spoke on the genealogy of his family the mighty ascetic viswamitra accompanied by vasishta said to janaka
o preeminent among men the glory of the two races of ikshvakus as also of videhas is in comprehensible and immeasurable there is none equal to these kings of the ikshvakus and videhas
o king it is a perfect match between sita and rama and urmila and lakshmana in respect of piety and beauty the match is perfect

o king o eminent among men we seek the hands of this virtuous kings two daughters unrivalled in beauty on earth as consorts

o king of kings janaka the bond between your race with its pious deeds and the ikshvakus may be strenghthened by this alliance
having heard the words of viswamitra which echoed the wish of vasishta janaka replied to the eminent ascetics with folded palms
since both of you eminent ascetics recomended this befitting alliance of the two races on your own i regard my race as blessed
let it be so be blessed let these two daughters of kusadhwaja mandavi and srutakirti be the wives of satrughna and bharata respectively and serve them
o great ascetic let the valiant four princes take the hands of four princesses on the same day
the wise o brahmin think the marriage is favourable when bhaga is prajapati on the succeeding day of the ascent of the two stars that is when poorva is followed by uttara phalguni
king janaka having spoken these pleasing words stood up and with folded hands addressing both the great ascetics
you have earned me a great religious merit i shall be always your disciple o eminent ascestics occupy these important seats
dasaratha has right on the city of ayodhya as much as i have on this this right is unquestionable so do whatever you think right
to the words of janaka king of videha king dasaratha the descendant of raghu cheerfully replied
you both brothers are lords of mithila you possess countless virtues you pay regards to many rishis and hosts of kings
be safe be blessed let me retire to the camp i have to perform the rites offerings to the forefathers
then renowned king dasaratha took leave of the two great ascetics then the rowned king dasaratha took have of the king janaka immediately following the two great ascetics
the king dasaratha reached the abode performed the sharaddha ceremony in accordance with the scriptures next day at dawn at appropriate time he gifted away cows a ceremony performed by initiating the bridegrooms into the marriage

with his sons for whose sake cows have been given away the cheerful king looked like shining prajapati surrrounded by the guardians of the world     thus ends the seventhsecond sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
the day the king dasaratha made a gift of the best available cows the heroic yudhajit arrived
yudhajit son of king kekaya bharatas own maternal uncle met the king dasaratha and enquiring about his wellbeing said
my father king of kekaya affectionately enquires about your welfare and they whose welfare you seek are hale and healthy
the king of kekaya o indra among kings o joy of the raghus desires to see my sisterss son and on that account i went to ayodhya
o king having heard in ayodhya that you have arrived in mithila along with your sons for their marriage i came here speedily with a desire to see my sisters son
king dasaratha then accorded a warm welcome to the honoured guest
with the night spent with his virtuous sons he who knew his duties got up at dawn and performed his daily devotionas and reached the sacrificial place following the rishis
with the necessary auspicious rites preparatory to marriage performed at an auspicious moment vijaya and keeping vasishta and other maharshis in the forefront rama accompanied by his brothers adorned with ornaments of every kind came into his fathers presence
adorable vasishta approached king janaka and said o king of videha king dasaratha the best of men with his sons having performed the auspicious rites preparatory to marriage is awaiting the bestower of the brides
the giver and the receiver indeed attain all ends fulfil your own duty by performing the auspicious marriage
thus addressed by the great self vasishta janaka the exceedingly generous highly lustrous eminent in ethics replied
did any guard prevent you whose command are you waiting for why do you hesitate to enter into your own house this kingdom is like your kingdom
o best of ascetics my daughters have performed all the rites relating to marriage they now stand at the foot of the altar shining like the bright flames of fire
ready at the altar i have been awaiting you o king without hindrance proceed why delay
at the words of janaka dasaratha brought his sons along with the hosts of ascetics and entered the marriage pavilion
thereafter the king of the videhas to vasishta o adherent of righteousness o lord o maharshi perform with the rishis the marriage ceremony of rama who causes delight to the three worlds
venerable and renowned ascetic vasishta said be it soand with viswamitra and virtuous satananda in the forefront an altar was duly improvised in the centre of the sacrificial pavilion he adorned the altar on all sides with fragrant flowers golden ladles waterpots with holes filled with sprouts earthen vessels with sprouts holders of burning fragrant incense conchshaped vessels sacrificial ladles bowls filled with with water for arghya and other purposes vessels with roasted paddy and grains of rice
brilliant and worshipful rishi vasishta chanted mantras according to tradition put the darbha grass of equal proportions around the altar placed the fire on the altar recited the mantras from the scriptures and offered oblations into the flame
thereafter king janaka brought sita adorned with various ornaments and placed her in the presence of agni in front of rama the enhancer of the joy of kausalya and said
this my daughter sita will be your partner in performing her rightful duty accept her farewell take her hand into your own
by being a devoted wife this highly fortunate sita would always follow you like a shadow thus spoken he sprinkled the water sanctified with mantras on them
then gods and sages exclaimed well well celestial kettledrums were sounded and there was a steady rain of flowers
then king janaka sprinkled on sita waters sanctified by mantras and immersed in delight said
lakshmana come and accept my daughter urmila ready to be bestowed upon you by me take her hand let there be no delay
janaka having spoken thus to lakshmana addressed bharata o descendant of the raghus hold mandavis hand in your own
the righteous king janaka said again o mightyarmed satrughna take the hands of srutakirti
o descendants of kakustha rama lakshmana bharata and satrughna you all are gentle you possess sound character you are true to your vows live with your wives let there be no delay
at the words of janaka the four princes took the hands of the four sisters with their own with the consent of vasishta
the great noble princes of the race of raghu accompanied by their wives circumambulated the altar of the sacred fire king janaka and the sages in obedience to the directions of vasishta and in accordance with the sastras conducted the matrimonial
while the descendants of kakustha rama lakshmana bharata and satrughna held the elegant hands of sita urmila mandavi and srutakirti there was a heavy rain of bright flowers from the sky
night over the great ascetic viswamitra profusely blessed the princes born in the race of raghu took leave of the two kings and set out towards the northern himalayas mountains
with the departure of viswamitra king dasaratha who was the source of happiness to his subjects took leave of janaka king of mithila and speedily set out for the city of ayodhya
king janaka lord of the videhas gave plenty of gifts to his daughters and followed king dasaratha for some distance on his journey to ayodhya
the king of mithila and father of the brides gave a hundred thousand cows excellent woollen carpets crores of silk garments four divisions of elephants horses chariots and infantry and welldecorated excellent male and maidservants shining in celestial beauty
immensely delighted he gave his excellent daughters gold pearls and corals
the lord of mithila bestowed a lot of wealth on his daughters and with the consent of the king dasaratha reentered his residence in mithila
king dasaratha of ayodhya also left along with his great sons preceded by the sages and followed by the army
while this tiger among men dasaratha was returning with the hosts of sages and his sons he observed here and there frightening birds making disagreeable sounds
seeing the beasts on the way rushing to the right the tiger among men enquired of vasishta
while the frightening birds are inauspicious the deer on the right are favourables why is this my heart beats my mind is depressed
to these words of king dasaratha the great ascetic vasishta replied in a gentle voice i shall tell you the consequences listen
the dreadful cries from the mouths of birds foretell an event of celestial nature likely to befall but the movements other of deer indicate restoration of peace therefore do not grieve
while they were conversing a storm blew shaking the earth and felling down beautiful trees
the sun was wrapped in dark the quarters were devoid of brightness the entire army was covered with ashes as if they fainted
at that time vasishta and other saints the king and his sons held their senses under control all others lost their consciousness
in that dreadful darkness while the army looked as if covered with ashes king dasaratha encountered the repressor of kings descendant of bhrugu and son of jamadagni with a terrible crown of matted hair inaccessible like kailasa mountain and unendurable like the fire at the time of dissolution the laymen gazing at his blazing energyhanging an axe on his shoulder and holding a bow in his hand which flashed like lighning and the principal arrow he looked like siva at the time of slaying of tripura
at the sight of the fearful appearance of parasurama looking like flaming fire vasishta and all other saints who were in the habit of chanting mantras and offering oblations to the fire whispered among themselves
enraged at the slaughter of his father by kartaveeryarjuna is he intent upon exterminating the kshatriya race having slaughtered the kshatriyas in the past he was freed from anger and grief is he again desirous of annihilating the kshatriyas
the saints having thus talked amongst themselves offered arghya to the son of bhargava of dreadful appearance and addressed him in soothing words o rama o rama
valiant parasurama son of jamadagni having accepted the homage offered by the saints addressed rama son of dasaratha and said     thus ends the seventyfourth sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
o rama rama son of dasaratha i have heard in full of your marvellous prowess and your feat in breaking the bow of siva
the fact that you have broken sivas bow is an astonishing act it is beyond imagination having heard it i have come here with another auspicious bow
this mighty dreadful bow was obtained through jamadagni you may display your prowess by fixing on it an arrow
o rama after witnessing your strength in stretching and stringing this bow i shall engage you in a duel acclaiming your prowess
when king dasaratha heard these words his face fell he humbly pleaded with him his hands folded
you are a brahmana highly renowned and withdrawn from anger against kshatriyas it behoves of you to give assurance of security to my sons who are young
born in the family of saint bhrigu versed in the study of the vedas and observance of vows you have promised in the name of the thousandeyed indra to renounce the arms
by adhering to righteousness in life and having conferred the earth upon kasyapa you retired to the forest and made your residence on the mahendra mountain
o great ascetic today you have arrived evidently for the total destruction of our family if rama is killed none of us will survive
disregarding these words of dasaratha the valiant son of jamadagni said to rama
these two excellent celestial bows are wellknown throughout the worlds they are stout and strong they are the best of all wellmade by visvakarma
o best among men o descendant of kakustha one of these broken by you was given by the gods to the threeeyed siva who wishing to fight the demon tripura with this bow destroyed him
this second bow which is unassailable was given by chief of the celestials to visnu o rama born in the race of kakutstha this highly radiant bow of visnu is as strong as the bow of siva
then all the gods in order to ascertain the strength and weakness of siva and visnu enquired of the grandsire brahma
foremost among the truthful grandsire brahma come to know the intention of the gods and triggered a conflict between the gods
in that thrilling fight between siva and visnu each desirous of victory over the other a ferocious battle took place causing ones hair to stand on end
then with the humkara produced by visnu sivas bow of dreadful prowess was stretched which struck the threeeyed mahadeva motionless
then hosts of sages charanas and the gods assembled there and beseeched both of them the preeminent among the gods to keep peace
now that the bow of siva was made inert by visnus prowess hosts of sages and gods acknowlged visnu as superior
glorious siva enraged at this placed the bow together with the arrow in the hands of rajarshi devarata in the country of videha
this bow of visnu o rama capable of conquering hostile cities was given in trust to richika belonging to the race of bhrigu
brilliant ruchika gave this bow to his son the great jamadagni my father a man of unrivalled valour
my father equipped with ascetic energy renounced the weapon and was killed by kartaveeryarjuna in a vulgar manner
o rama having heard the slaying of my father incomparable in extreme ruthlessness i decimated the kshatriya race again and again out of fury as they were born and reborn i conquered the entire earth at the conclusion of the sacrifice i conferred it on the great soul kasyapa of meritorious acts gifted with ascetic energy i have now made the mahendra mountain my abode
o mighty rama when i heard that you have broken the bow with your extraordinary prowess i have come here quickly
respect the duties of a kshatriya o rama take hold of this great uncommon bow of visnu inherited by me from my father and forefathers
o descendant of kakustha this best bow is capable of conquering enemy cities fix an arrow if it is possible for you to do so then i shall engage you in a duel      thus ends the seventyfifth sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
hearing the words of the son of jamadagni parasurama rama the son of dasaratha avoiding further conversation out of respect for his father intercepted parasurama saying
o descendant of bhrigu i have listened to the marvellous acts you have performed o brahman i commend you for discharging your duty in repaying the debt to your father
you underrate me o bhargava as though i am devoid of valour and incompetent to perform the duties of a kshatriya now witness my energy and valour
having spoken thus the enraged rama gifted with quick vigour seized the bow and arrow from parasuramas hands
infuriated rama bent the bow stretched it fixed the arrow and addressed parasurama the son of jamadagni
you are a brahmin o parasurama you are also related to viswamitra hence you are worthy of homage i cannot therefore release this against you to take your life
i shall destroy your mobility o parasurama or the higher worlds earned through your matchless asceteic energy tell me which one you choose
on conquering the hostile cities and destroying the pride and strength of the enemy by its prowess this celestial arrow of visnu shall not go in vain
the gods with the grandsire brahma in the forefront accompanied by sages in groups assembled there to see rama holding that mighty bow gandharvas apsaras siddhas charanas kinnaras yakshas rakshsas and nagas also came there to witness that great wonder
then when rama stretched the great bow the world became motionless the son of jamadagni parasurama bereft of prowess gazed at him with astonishment
his energy subdued by ramas prowess the paralysed parasurama son of jamadagni spoke in gentle words to him whose eyes resembled the lotus petals
when i gave this entire earth to kasyapa he said to me you shall not live in my country
o descendant of kakustha having gifted this earth to kasyapa i promised him that i would not live here during night time for the earth belongs to him
for this you should not destroy my mobility o valiant son of the raghus i shall go to mahendra the best of mountains with the speed of mind
strike with the principal arrow the unrivalled worlds conquered by my asceticism do not delay o rama
by the fact that you have stretched this bow i have come to know that you are visnu lord of the gods slayer of madhu o imperishable one o tormentor of enemies fare well
all your deeds are incomparable you are unassailable in combat all these hosts of gods have assembled here and are looking at you
i have been defeated by you o descendant of kakustha lord of the three worlds therefore it is not right for me to feel ashamed
you are faithful to vows o rama this arrow has no equal in prowess it behoves of you to release it against me after its release i shall go to the excellent mahendra mountain
thus spoke parasurama son of jamadagni to rama the valiant son of dasaratha who then discharged the principal arrow
having witnessed the destruction of those regions earned by him through asceticism the son of jamadagni left for the best of mountains mahendra
thereafter all the quarters including the intermediaries were cleared of darkness hosts of sages and gods extolled rama when he wielded the bow
parasurama the competent son of jamadagni having praised rama the son of dasaratha circumbulated him and left for his abode     thus ends the seventysixth sarga of balakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
when parasurama departed rama son of dasaratha with a serene mind gave the bow along with the arrow to varuna of immeasurable strength
thereafter rama the descendant of the raghus paid obeisance to vasishta and other rishis and looked at his father who appeared agitated said
parasurama son of jamadagni has gone let the four divisions of the army of which you are the commander proceed towards ayodhya
the army which is under your command o king is awaiting your orders like the chatakas awaiting water direct them to proceed
on hearing the words parasurama has departed from rama king dasaratha embraced him and kissed his forehead the king immensely happy felt he and his son were reborn
thereafter king dasaratha directed his army to proceed speedily in advance when he reached the city of ayodhya it looked welldecorated with flags and banners it resounded with trumpets the royal highways were sprinkiled with water and strewn with flowers it was filled with groups of people awaiting with delight the arrival of the king the citizens produced merry sounds with musical instruments
prosperous king dasaratha of great fame followed by his elegant sons entered the city of ayodhya while the citizens and brahmins came forward from a long distance to welcome him who reentered his palace looking like the himalayan moutain
the king and his kith and kin were received with honour in a pleasing manner kausalya sumitra and kaikeyi of slender waist and other women attending on the king were busy in receiving the new brides
thereafter the queens received the highly fortunate sita urmila of high fame and both the daughters of kusadhwaja mandavi and srutakirti
with auspicious aricles in their hands all the new brides who shone in silken apparels immediately went to temples and worshipped the family deities
then all the princesses paid obeisance to those worthy of worship and entered their residence that resembled the palace of kuberathereafter pleased with gifting cows riches and corn to brahmins and satisfying them they joined their husbands and enjoyed themselves in privacy
all the princes who were best of men great souls incomparable in prowess on earth capable of the use of weapons and endowed with wealth moved about with friends serving their father and following his commands
after some time king dasaratha the delight of the raghu race addressed his son bharata
the heroic yudhajit son of the king of kekaya your maternal uncle has come here and wishes to take you with him o child
o knower of dharma this was his request to me in mithila in the midst of sages you should bring him delight by obliging him
having heard the words of dasaratha bharata son of kaikeyi paid obeisance to his father and rama embraced lakshmana and prepared for the journey with satrughna
valiant bharata the best of men took leave of his father dasaratha a tireless brother rama and mothers and departed with satrughna
after the departure of bharata mighty rama and lakshmana continued to serve their godlike father
righteous rama discharged his duties towards the citizens for their allround comfort and welfare giving top psriority to the execution of the command of his father
with unfailing regularity rama carried out his duties towards his mothers and his elders looking into them from time to time
dasaratha was pleased with the good conduct and character of rama brahmanas as also the inhabitants of the city and the people of the country at large were happy with him
in world the glorious and virtuous rama armed with the power of truthfulness became the protector of the people like brahma to living beings
with his heart fixed on sita to whom he was always devoted rama the wise went about enjoying with her the beauty of all the seasons
chosen by his father sita became ramas beloved wife with her virtue and beauty his affection for her grew further
for sita her husband was doubly dear they were clearly communicating through each others heart every thought generated in the mind
arriving with laksmana at the lake filled with lotuses lilies and fishes rama his senses oppressed burst into tears
he was glad to see it but sad at the thought of sita his passion stirred his senses shaken he said this to saumitri
o saumitri pampa looks beautiful with its water clear as vaidurya its lilies and lotuses in full bloom and its trees in all their variety
o saumitri look at the pleasant forest around pampa where trees stand splendid like mountainpeaks
already saddened due to the abduction of sita and plight of bharata i am tormented by spring
though stricken with grief i feel so delighted to see the auspicious pampa with its wonderful forest and cool water scattered with flowers
abounding in lotuses birds and beasts and vicious serpents moving about it looks splendid indeed
the bluishyellow grass dotted with different kinds of flowers fallen from the trees shines like a carpet spread
entwined with flowering creepers the treetops are covered all over with rich loads of flowers
o saumitri it is the season of spring the trees are laden with fruits and fragrant flowers ecstatic blows the gentle freeze
look at the flowering trees sending showers of flowers like water dropping from the clouds o saumitri
various forest trees shaken by the force of the wind scatter flowers on the beautiful rocky surface of earth
o saumitri look the breeze appears to be playing with the flowers that are fallen and that are still on the trees
shaken by the strong wind all over the tops of trees look as if they are knitted together
the gentle touch of the breeze that blows cool like sandalwood full of pure fragrance takes away the fatigue of the body
as if the trees are singing swayed by the wind while the bees in the forest fragrant with honey hum in tune
the huge trees in the scenic mountainranges look delightful with their blossoms touching the peaks
with the tops of trees covered with flowers the black bees hovering humming over them the trees shaken by the restless wind look like singers the trees with the top decked with flowers the bees like black hair on the head swaying in the wind look like dancing and singing
see these karnikaras in full bloom all over looking like people clad in yellow silk adorned with golden ornaments
o saumitri this spring season resonating with the sounds of several kinds of birds kindles my anguish as i am separated from sita
kandarpa cupid torments me while i am already griefstricken the cuckoo with his challenging cheerfulness mocks me
lakshmana while i am already lovestricken the swamphen gallinule a marshbird troubles me with its joyous cackles in the beautiful foreststream
while in the hermitage in the past my beloved was very glad to hear such sounds invite me to join her and rejoice again
see the different kinds of birds flying towards trees shrubs and vines making wonderful sounds all over
o lakshmana the female birds praised by their flocks are united with their male partners enjoying the sweet sounds of large black bees they are singing melodiously
these trees seem to enkindle my passion through all sorts of sounds like the loud cackle of swamphens and the sweet warble of the male cuckoos
the fire of spring with clusters of asoka flowers as its charcoal its coppercoloured tender leaves as flames the buzz of bees as its crackle will as if consume me
o saumitri my life is meaningless if i cannot see my beloved sita with her delicate eyelashes beautiful locks of hair and her sweet voice
o sinless one the spring season is dear to my beloved sita when the outskirts of the forest are filled with voices of the cockoo
the fire of grief ignited by kandarpa the god of love enhanced by the effects of spring will certainly consume me soon
unable to see my beloved wife the very sight of these lovely trees intensifies my love for her who shines resplendent in me
when in place of vaidehi i see spring with its cool breeze that used to take away the sweat generated by sensual enjoyment my sorrow is intensified
o saumitri the cruel breeze of the spring forest torments me as i am now immersed in grief in the absence of my fawneyed beloved
delightful are the peacocks dancing here and there their feathers looking like crystal windows flung open by the wind
the peacocks intoxicated with passion for the peahens surround them intensifying my longing for vaidehi
look at the lovelorn peahen excited by love dancing on the moutain slope o lakshmana engrossed in love she dances for wooing the peacock
overwhelmed with love the enchanted peacock spreading his wings is running after her making sounds as though mocking her
the peacocks beloved for sure has not been abducted by the demon therefore he is dancing in delight in the forest in the company of his beloved
it is extremely unbearable for me to stay in the forest during this season of flowers spring look at the passion even among beasts and birds o lakshmana and craving for love the peahen sports near her mate
had the largeeyed janaki not been stolen she would have also paid advances to me in this manner with all her love and excitement
the trees look enchanting with flowers in full bloom with bees hovering over them but the flowers fruitlessly drop down on the ground
if spring reigns wherever my beloved sita is she must have been overwhelmed with similar sad feelings like me
spring must not have touched the place where she is now staying otherwise how could my sita with eyes like blue lotus live without me
or if there is spring where my beloved lives what can that lady of beautiful hips do threatened by enemies
eager to speak with her gentle voice my young beloved blessed with eyes like lotus petals will certainly give up her life unable to enjoy the spring
my mind makes me feel certain that sita with her chastity might not be able to live separated from me
sita has her love truly fixed in me my love for her is equally steadfast
this cool breeze that carries the fragrance of flowers that is gentle in its touch feels like fire when i think about my beautiful beloved
the pleasant touch of the wind which made me happy in the company of sita intensifies my grief now in her absence
the crow that cried unhappily flying in the sky as if to foretell my separation from sita is now on the tree singing joyfully suggesting my possible union with sita
the same crow attendant on vaidehi there will take me to my largeeyed beloved
losten o lakshmana to the sweet warblings of the birds on the blossoming treetops of the forest my love for her sita enhances with their sweet voices
this honeybee is eager to approach the bunch of tilaka flowers in bloom scattered by the wind like a lover advancing towards his passionate beloved
this asoka tree increases by nature the sorrow of lovers perhaps it make its presence felt in order to intimidate me with the clusters of its flowers scattered by the wind
o lakshmana these mangotrees full of blossoms appear like sexited men who have applied fragrant unguents to their bodies
o saumitri o tiger among men look at the kinnaras wandering here and there in the wonderful forest around the pampa lake
o lakshmana look at these lotuses with fine fragrance all over the water glowing like the rising sun
this pampa with its water clear and fragrant with red and blue lotuses is filled with swans and geese
lake pampa shines with lotuses with bees on their filaments like the rising sun
frequented by the chakravakas and surrounded by the wonderful forest with thirsty elephants and deer this pampa looks beautiful
o lakshmana look at the lotuses in clear water dashing against one another due to waves caused by the force of the wind
unable to see my beloved with eyes large like totus petals and an ardent lover of lotuses i have no desire to live
oh how adversly disposed is the god of love he makes me remember that auspicious lady with a pleasing voice when she is lost and difficult to reach
if the spring that has set in with the trees in bloom does not kill me i have once again to endure the agony of love
whatever was endearing to me earlier in the company of sita has turned out to be disenchanting without her
seeing the delicate petals around the lotus buds that look like beautiful eyelids of sita my eyes crave for them o lakshmana
the bleeze that blows through the trees carrying the fragrance of the filaments of lotuses feels pleasant like sitas breath
look at the very spectacular karnikara tree with its blossmed branches on the mountain slope towards the southern side of pampa o saumitri
this king of mountains is rich with plenty of minerals and therefore generates multicoloured dust particles splattered by the speed of the wind
o saumitri with leafless kimsuka trees in full bloom all over the mountain ranges they appear beautiful like blazing mountains
very closely grown on the banks of pampa stand malati mallika and karavira trees with their clusters of fragrant blossoms
fully blossmed ketaka sinduvara madhavi and kunda bushes in spring scatter their fragrance everywhere
lotuses and blue asokas are also in bloom lodhra trees on the mountainslopes look golden like the lions mane
there are trees like ankola kuranta churnaka paribhadraka mango patali kovidara muchukunda arjuna ketaka uddalaka shirisha shimshupa and shava all in full bloom on the mountain peaks
while the branches of trees swayed by the wind draw close the creepers follow the trees like lovely women in a drunken state
the wind blows from tree to tree mountain to mountain and forest to forest as though content to enjoy all the fragrance
some trees stood fragrant with profuse flowers and some with buds shining blue
fascinated by the flowers the honeybees cling to one or the other humming this is soft this is sweet and this is fullyblossomed
the bees greedy for honey move among the trees on the banks of pampa resting for a while at one place they fly soon to another
with countless flowers fallen on their own from trees and scattered like a bed of flowers on stone the ground is rendered comfortable enough to relax on
o saumitri varieties of colourful flowers some red and some yellow are spread out on the mountain slopes
winter has ended and the season of flowers has set in o saumitri the trees are full of flowers as if competing with one another
the trees crowned with flowers filled with humming bees look splendid it appears they are calling one another o lakshmana
this duck entering into auspicious water sports with its beloved and incites my love
o saumitri look at this lake of cool water filled with lotuses chakravakas flying about and ducks floating
pampa filled with swimming kraunchas and frequented by big animals looks splendid the joyous warbling of a variety of birds is highly exciting they kindle my passion for my young moonfaced lotus eyed beloved
if i find my dear beloved here on these mountain slopes full of passionate birds how happy will i not feel
o saumitri i can be alive and happy if sita of slender waist enjoys here with me the sweet breeze of pampa
o lakshmana blessed are those who enjoy the breeze filled with fragrance of lotuses of the surrounding forests of pampa the gentle and auspicious breeze indeed takes away the sorrow of the mind
how can janakas daughter with eyes like lotus petals so young and loving sustain her life away from me she must be feeling quite dejected
if righteous and truthful janaka enquires about sitas wellbeing in the assembly of people what am i to speak
she followed me o lakshmana as i was deposed from the kingdom and distraught now helpless how can i live without her
unable to see her beautiful face with auspicious eyes like fragrant lotuses i feel so depressed
when can i listen to sitas sweet wholesome and virtuous incomparable words interlaced with her gentle smile o lakshmana
my young and faithful beloved used to put up a brave face and speak to me in all propriety to cheer me up in the midst of suffering in the forest whenever i felt tormented by passion
you may go to ayodhya o lakshmana to see our loving brother bharata it is not possible for me to survive without the daughter of janaka
thus spoke lakshmana these befitting unforgettable words to his hissouled brother rama wailing like an orphan
o rama the foremost of men control yourself be blessed people who are pure at heart do not feel depressed at heart
even if ravana enters into the womb of diti mother of demons along with sita i will slay him there if he does not return the daughter of mithila
o noble prince be blessed maintain composure without making any effort it is not possible to achieve the objective and recoup loss
o revered sire enterprise is supreme strength nothing is difficult in this world for one who is up and doing
enterprising men will never be disappointed in their mission it is possible to get sita through effort alone
bardon grief give up emotion you are a great soul you are not aware of your great accomplishments the temporary sorrow has relegated ramas nobility to the background lakshmana is trying to restore the same
thus persuaded by lakshmana rama who was hitherto besieged by grief and delusion could set them aside and regain patience
no more disturbed by delusion rama of unimaginable valour crossed the very brilliant pampa with beautiful plants floating on its surface
the great rama was overcome with grief while scanning the entire forest with its streams and caves engrossed in her thoughts dejected at heart and inflicted with pain he set both accompanied by lakshmana
the great soul lakshmana striding like a mighty elephant with a steady mind followed rama dutifully protecting him with his strength
the swiftfooted mighty king of monkeys saw those two men of wonderful appearance as they were wandering at rishyamuka he neither got scared nor showed signs of nervousness
the great soul sugriva walking slowly like an elephant saw both of them and became despondent worried and immersed in fear
having seen the mighty rama and lakshmana all other monkeys got frightened and ran into a sacred and safe hermitage     thus ends the first sarga of kishkindakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
on seeing the two great souls heroic rama and lakshmana wielding the best of weapons sugriva was alarmed
agitated at heart the best of vanaras started in all directions and could not settle down at one spot
beholding the two strong heroes the monkey sugriva was very much frightened his heart sank
righteous sugriva became highly agitated deliberated with all his followers on the pros and cons of the situation
sugriva lord of monkeys extremely agitated at the sight of both rama and lakshmana spoke to his minister
on seeing these supreme bowmen sugrivas counsellers left for the peak of another mountain
the leaders of the monkey troops reached sugriva the lord of monkeys in no time and stood surrounding him
jumping from one mountain to another swiftly and shaking the mountain tops the monkeys reached one spot
then the mighty monkeys jumping on the trees in full bloom shook them
the great monkeys went on leaping all over the great rishyamuka mountain scaring the deer wildcats and tigers
thereafter all the ministers of sugriva assembled together on the king of mountains and stood in front of sugriva with folded hands
suspecting that vali might have sent them rama and lakshmana hanuman skilful in communication said to sugriva who was trembling in fear
this is a great mountain range of malaya and there is no fear for vali here give up this fear
o chief of monkeys i do not see here any sign of the cruel vali of whom you are afraid
o goodnatured sugriva you are afraid of your elder brother vali as he is evilminded and sinful but i do not see any reason for you to be frightened as he is not found anywhere here
oh monkey whoever is lilylivered cannot be steady it is evident that your very nature as a monkey makes you restless
having heard the wise words of hanuman sugriva addressed him with words more auspicious
who would not be apprehensive of these two longarmed and largeeyed individuals comparable to sons of gods wielding arrows bows and swords
i support these two excellent men might have been sent by vali kings have many friends and so it may not be appropriate to trust any king
one has to identify these men roaming in disguise these are not trustworthy and could even be our enemies making us believe them so as to attack us when we are not vigilant
vali is wise in his actions kings employ many strategies to annihilate their enemies our gullible individuals should be able to detect them
o hanuman assume an ordinary form and approach them try to read them through their gestures traits forms and conversations
o best of monkeys ascertain their purpose by praising them and studying their honest intentions gain the confidence of the wielders of bows and if you find them agreeable enquire the purpose of their entering this forest
instructed thus by the king of the monkeys hanuman son of the windgod decided to meet both rama and lakshmana
hanuman the venerable powerful and not easily conquerable monkey honoured the words of the great lord of the monkeys offered salutations and said so be it and then proceeded towards the mighty rama and lakshmana     thus ends the second sarga of kishkindakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by the sage valmiki
listening to great sugriva hanuman leaped from mount rishyamuka on to the location of the raghavas
hanuman son of the windgod with an ingenious mind assumed the guise of a mendicant
approaching the raghavas in all humility valiant hanuman offered them reverential salutations and addressed them in gentle and pleasing words
the valiant son of the windgod hanuman offered those heroes whose power came from their sense of truth due respect and spoke to them in all gentleness
you both fair in complexion resemble royal sages or gods you appear like ascetics and pursue vows in austerity how come you are present here as if to frighten the animals and other creatures roaming this forest
gazing at the trees on the bank of pampa you both appear in brilliant complexion as if to enhance the beauty of the auspicious river water though young courageous and with handsome shoulders you seem to sigh in exhaustion and though you look like ascetics robed in bark you seem to terrify these creatures
having the gaze of a lion both of you are heroic in your stance as each of you hold a bow resembling the rainbow you seem to be mighty warriors eager to annihilate the enemies with the valour of superior bulls and your shoulders resembling elephants trunks you look magnificent handsome and brilliant no doubt you are the best among the humans
you are young and radiant like the gods this king of mountains rishyamuka dazzles with your brilliance although you deserve to be sovereigns how is it that you are here into the forest
both of you appear alike with eyes like lotus petals and locks of matted hair you look like heroes descending from the world of the gods you look like the sun and the moon dropped incidentally on this earth with shoulders like those of a lion and the majesty of energetic bulls you broadchested warriors appear like divine beings though in fact humans
your long arms and spherelike shoulders appear as strong as iron clubs although they deserve to be decked with ornaments how is it they are unadorned
to me you both deserve to rule the entire earth encompassed by seas and forests and adorned with mountains like vindhya and meru
smeared with wonderful unguents your bows look very attractive and they glow very much like indras golden thunderbolt
your quivers also appear beautiful for they are fully filled with sharp and deadly arrows which look like the hissing of dreadful snakes
your long and broad swords appear very huge in size being encrusted with pure gold they glitter brilliant like snakes in hyberation
why are you silent while i am talking i am here to apprise about a great and righteous warrior sugriva the chief of the troop of monkeys sadly wandering all over the land here banished by his brother
i am a monkey called hanuman i am here sent by great king sugriva the best of monkeys
the righteous sugriva wishes to make friendship with both of you for his wellbeing i came here disguised as a mendicant from rishyamuka mountain i am a monkey son of the windgod and minister to sugriva i can assume any form at my free will and go anywhere i like
the eloquent hanuman having spoken thus to both rama and lakshmana good at speaking said no more
having heard him the illustrious rama cheerfully said to brother lakshmana standing nearby
here is minister to sugriva the great chief of monkeys whom i wish to see
o saumitri conqueror of enemies this monkey sugrivas minister is skilled in friendly communication reply to him in words gentle and sweet
unless wellversed in rigveda yajurveda and samaveda for sure it is not possible for anyone to articulate so well
surely he seems to have studied well the whole of grammar for there is not a single mispronunciation in his entire speech
his words are auspicious they are refined neither fast nor slow his utterances captivate the heart
his colourful words flow from all the three sources the bottom of his bosom his throat and his head whose mind will not adore them even if one happens to be an enemy holding a sword
o sinless one how can a king whoever he be not accomplish his goal in the past with such an ambassador
thus instructed saumitri who was equally skilled in speach replied to sugrivas minister son of the windgod
o learned hanuman having heard about the virtues of great sugriva lord of the monkeys we eagerly look forward to meeting him
o virtuous hanuman we will do whatever you are saying for it is the message of sugriva
pleased with lakshmanas words spoken in a skilful manner hanuman the monkey son of the windgod resolved to make friendship with them     thus ends the third sarga of kishkindakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
after listening to the sweet words of lakshmana hanuman having done what he had to do felt happy and thought of sugriva
the great sugriva thinks hanuman who had done his duty is likely to acquire his kingdom because great rama who would help in the work of sugriva has also come
hanuman the best of the monkeys learned in conversation felt extremely happy and enquired from rama
why have you come with your brother to this dreadful inaccessible forest surrounding pampa full of different varieties of serpents and wild animals
having listened to hanuman and urged by rama lakshmana told him about the great rama son of dasaratha
he never hated any one nor did any one ever hate him to all his subjects he was like another father the creator brahma and he was generous in giving gifts while performing yajnas rituals with fire like agnistoma
here is his eldest son popularly known as rama he is the protector of all beings and never failed his fathers instructions
this glorious rama was followed by his wife sita like the rays of the effulgent sun follow him to the end of the day
i am his younger brother called lakshmana i have accepted the service of this learned virtuous and grateful man
this man who should have lived in comfort and in reverence one who was worthy of all the wellwishers lost his wealth and was banished into the forest he is now deprived of his wife kidnapped by an unknown demon who could assume any form at will
ditis son called danu who had been cursed to live the life of a demon had said that sugriva the best among monkeys would be able to locate her
that valiant sugriva can spot the demon who has abducted your wife said danu and disappeared happily into heaven shining in brilliance
i have given a factual account of everything since you asked me now rama and i have arrived seeking sugrivas shelter
having earned supreme fame through his munificence in the past this lord of the world now craves sugrivas indulgence
one whose father was once a protector of dharma a refuge to all now seeks sugrivas shelter
this righteous rama who used to lend in the past protection to the whole world and indeed a refuge to all venerable sir now seeks sugrivas shelter
this rama for whose grace the subjects were ever bobolden to him now seeks the favour of the chief of monkeys
famous in all the three worlds this rama who was the firshborn of dasaratha endowed with all virtues and ever respected by all the kings of this earth now seeks shelter of sugriva chief of monkeys
sugriva lord of monkeys ought to help rama who tormented by and overwhelmed with grief seeks his favour
to saumitri who was speaking thus in a piteous tone his eyes filled with tears the eloquent hanuman replied
it is a matter of great fortune that you who have intelligence control over your senses and conquered anger have come to see the lord of monkeys who needs instead to approach you
in fact seriously offended by his brother vali who treated him like his enemy and expelled him from the kingdom he is now abandoned in the forest his wife hijacked
sugriva son of the sungod along with us will extend all help to you in your search for sita
hanuman having spoken with sweet gentle words said to the raghavas we will now go to sugriva
having offered reverential salutations to hanuman as per tradition righteous lakshmana now spoke to rama
o raghava this monkey son of the windgod appears pleased as evident from his words as he is a man of action take your work as accomplished now
it is evident from his words and from his cheerful face that hanuman is pleased i know that this heroic son of the windgod will never tell a lie
hanuman son of the windgod endowed with great wisdom carried both the raghava warriors to the king of monkeys
hanuman who was an elephant among monkeys gave up the guise of a mendicant and assuming the form of the monkeys lifted both the heroes on to his back and proceeded
the son of the windgod the most valiant the supremely heroic monkey and the one welladmired having performed his task felt immensely happyand with an auspicious feeling departed for the great mountain rishyamuka along with rama and lakshmana     thus ends the fourth sarga of kishkindakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
leaving rishyamuka hanuman reached the malaya mountain seeing the chief of monkeys there he announced the arrival of the heroic raghavas
this rama of greatwisdom and valour endowed with the power of truth has arrived here along with his brother lakshmana
born in the ikshvaku race rama dasarathas son distinguished for his righteousness is here to carry out the orders of his father
while the great rama armed with selfrestraint was living in the forest his wife was abducted by ravana so he has come to you seeing refuge
this rama son of a king who had gratified the firegod through many yajnas like rajasuya and aswamedha gifted hundreds of thousands of cows and ruled this earth with truth and austerity has come seeking help for a woman
both the brothers rama and lakshmana seek friendship with you as both of them are worthiest of worship welcome them with due reverence
hanumans words took away sugrivas great fear for rama and filled him with cheer this bull among monkeys gave up his natural appearance and and assuming an attractive human form spoke to rama lovingly
you are a great hero affectionate to all and wellversed in all dharmas the son of the windgod has in fact apprised me of your virtues
o lord that you are eager to have friendship with me who is a monkey is a great honour and is extremely beneficial to me
if you are desirous of my friendship here is my arm palm stretched out to you with due regard establish our bond firmly holding my palm in yours
rama became very happy to hear sugrivas warm words and pressed his hand with his delighted he went close to sugriva and hugged him tightly and affectionately
then hanuman vanquisher of enemies gave up his guise of a mendicant assumed his natural form and generated fire by rubbing two pieces of wood wellpleased at heart he made an offering of flowers to the flaming fire and placed it between them
they both circumambulated the blazing fire and solemnized their friendship
rama and the monkey contented at heart yet not fully content continued looking at each other
you are a dear friend to me your sorrow is my sorrow your pleasure is my pleasure we are one and the same said sugriva to rama his heart overflowing with happiness
then sugriva cut the branch of a sala tree with luxuriant leaves and flowers spread it on the ground and sat down along with raghava
then hanuman the bull among monkeys felt very happy cut the branch of a sandalwood tree full of flowers and gave it to lakshmana
then sugriva eyes sparkling with joy replied to rama in a sweet gentle voice
o rama i have been insulted deeply and my wife hijacked stricken with fear i have taken refuge in this inaccessible forest
o rama humiliated by my brother vali i have developed enmity with him terribly distraught and disturbed i live in this forest in great fear
o reverend kakutstha i feel helpless with fear from vali save me you should release me free from fear
the righteous and glorious rama to whom dharma is very dear said to sugriva with a gentle smile on his face when he was entreated thus
o great monkey i know friendship is the fruit of a beneficial deed i will kill that vali who has usurped your wife
these arrows covered with kanka feathers sharp and straight at the tip comparable to great indras thunderbolt are burning bright like the sun looking like angry serpents they will unfailingly strike at the miscreant vali soon
with these sharp serpentlike arrows vali will be killed he will fall down on the ground like a mountain shatteredyou will see it now
sugriva very much pleased with the words of rama spoke highly of him
o rama by your grace i will get my wife and kingdom back o king accomplish this so that i can destroy my elder brother my enemy o lion among men
while sugriva was making a friendly alliance with rama sitas left eye like lotus valis left eye glittering like gold and ravanas left eye blazing like fire twitched at the same time for a moment twitching of left eye is considered auspicious to a woman and ominous to a man     thus ends the fifth sarga of kishkindakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
sugriva was pleased to say to rama delight of the raghu race once again o rama hanuman jewel among ministers has told me the cause of your coming to this desolate forest while you were residing in the forest a demon who was looking for an opportunity carried off your wife the princess from mithila daughter of janaka finding her alone while she was crying piteously he killed jatayu the vulture who pretested
very soon you will be relieved of the grief caused by the separation from your wife just as visnu retrieved the vedas carried away by the demons madhu and kaitabha i will deliver her to you
o subduer of enemies i will restore her to you even if she is kept in the bowels of the earth or in the vaults of heaven
o longarmed rama take these words of mine as true your consort cannot be absorbed with impunity even by the denizens of heaven including indra or the ogres on earth any more than food cooked with poisongive up grief
yes i remember i had observed a lady being carried away by a wicked demon she was crying loudly oh rama oh rama oh lakshmana in a husky voice it was maithili she was wriggling on the lap of ravana like a female serpent
seeing me as the fifth member seated on a mountain she dropped down the auspicious ornaments bundled in her veil
rama we have kept them safely i will fetch them so that you should be able to identify them
rama then said to sugriva one who used pleasing words o my friend why delay get them here immediately
on hearing this sugriva at once entered into the deep cave of the mountain to get the ornaments and veil in order to please rama
that monkey brought out the veil and auspicios ornaments showed them to rama and said please see
holding the raiment as well as the ornaments ramas eyes were filled with tearshe appeared like the moon covered with dews
on account of his deep attachment for sita he shed profuse tears unable to maintain his natural composure he sank down to the ground saying o my darling sita and cried inconsolably
pressing the excellent ornaments to his bosom again and again rama hissed like a cobra provoked in its anthill
rama began to wail piteously while tears streamed down his eyes incessantly he looked at saumitri standing by his side and said
o lakshmana behold the veil and the ornaments dropped on the ground by vaidehi while she was being abducted
sita for sure dropped these ornaments on the grassy ground they are in good shape without any damage
thus addressed by rama lakshmana replied i recognise neither the armlets nor the earrings i only recognise the anklets as i used to bow at her feet daily
then rama said to sugrivatell me o sugriva to which region that fiercelooking demon has carried away my sita who is dearer than my life
let me know where dwells that huge ogre who has caused this agony to me i will exterminate all the demons
by abducting maithili he has stirred my fierce anger and has opened the door of his death
o lord of monkeys tell me the whereabouts of that nightranger who has carried off my darling from the heart of the forest and has harassed her i will send him now to the abode of death     thus ends the sixth sarga of kishkindakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
on hearing the words of rama in deep distress the monkey replied to him with folded hands his throat choked with tears
i do not have any knowledge of this sinful demons dwelling his capability his valour or his clan or his despicable lineage
o subduer of enemies give up sorrow i promise i will make necessary effort so that you will obtain the princess from mithila
with all my capability i will kill ravana and his clan thus i will be able to satisfy you soon with my efforts
give up despair it is enough be patient maintain your natural dispositionit is unworthy of men like you to entertain such frivolus thoughts
separated from my wife i too am afflicted with deep grief but i do not brood i do not lose patience
i am an ordinary monkey born even then i do not brood over my wife you are highsouled humble and patient why do you grieve
restrain the flow of your tears be patient men like you endowed with equilibrium and dignity and patience ought not to leave their composure
in times of grief or loss of wealth or at the hour of death one who is patient does not abandon his wisdom he does not despair
i implore you with folded palms on account of our friendship to show manliness you should not give in to grief
there is no happiness for those who give way to sorrow their brilliance is dimmed therefore you ought not grieve
even the chances of survival are doubtful for a man who is overpowered by sorrow give up sorrow and have patience o king
out of friendly concern i offer my opinion in your interest i am not competent to advise you respecting my friendship you should never yield to grief
consoled by the sweet words of sugriva rama wiped his face filled with tears by the hem of his upper cloth
when lord rama the scion of the kakutstha race was comforted by these words of sugriva he came to his senses and clasping him said
o sugriva you have done what a friend should have done in a befitting manner with your sweet words and good wishes
o friend you have guided me back to my senses thus it is difficult to find a friend like you specially at this time
indeed you must make effort to trace the princess from mithila and the evilminded fierce demon ravana
now tell me about my duty without any hesitation i assure you that your desire will be fulfilled just as seeds sown in a fertile land with timely rains bear fruit
o tiger amongst monkeys accept my words uttered out of injured honour in their true sense
i have never uttered a false word earlier nor will i do it in future this is my promise i swear by truth alone
sugriva and his counsellors felt glad on hearing ramas words particularly the assurance given by him
man and monkey then met privately and shared the weal and woe of one another
wise sugriva chief of monkeys heard the words of the magnanimous rama a bull among men he felt glad at heart thinking that his task has been achieved     thus ends the seventh sarga of kishkindakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by the sage valmiki
sugriva the monkey was very pleased with ramas words and said to him in front of lakshmana
since one like you endowed with all virtues has become my friend i am now worthy of grace of the gods in all respects there is no doubt
o rama my sinless lord it is possible to attain even the kingdom of the gods with your help what to speak of my own kingdom
o rama since you born in raghava dynasty have become my friend with fire as witness i have become equally honourable among my relatives and friends
you will come to know slowly that i am also a friend worthy of youit is not proper for me to speak of my qualities flatter myself
the affection of exalted souls is exceedingly stable like the patience of selfcontrolled and wellcomposed men like you
good friends considervaluables such as silver or gold clothes or ornaments of worldly wealth indivisible
whether rich or poor afflicted or happy flawless or guilty a friend is the ultimate refuge to a friend
one will not hesitate to sacrifice wealth or happiness or even life for the sake of a friend like you
as wise lakshmana brilliant like indra stood witness rama said it is true as you say to sugriva who spoke pleasing words
with mighty rama and lakshmana standing by sugriva cast his eyes eagerly all round the forest
then the chief of monkeys saw a sala tree looking lovely with tender leaves and flowers graced by bees
sugriva cut a branch of the beautifully blossomed sala tree with plenty of leaves spread it on the ground and squatted along with rama
thereafter hanuman also broke a branch of the sala tree and seated lakshmana on it
now rama seated comfortably on the best of mountains overgrown with trees full of flowers and fruits appeared tranguil like an ocean extremely delighted and excited sugriva spoke to rama words that got mixed up with softness and sweetness out of love
i am sadly roaming here in the great rishyamuka mountain my wife stolen offended by my brother and frightened
o rama my brother is my enemy deceived and threatened by him i live in the forest stricken with fear and utterly confused
o great warrior who can frighten all the worlds scared of vali i feel helpless like an orphan to whom you ought to extend your grace
thus spoken to the glorious rama lover of righteousness who knew his duty replied to sugriva with a smile on his face
while a friend is known for his help an enemy is known for his offensiveness i will this very day kill the one who wrested your wife
here are my highspeed winged arrows glowing like fierce fire born out of kartikeyas bed of reedsthey are smooth and welljointed decked with gold comparable in strength to great indras thunderbolt very sharp with pointed tips looking like angry serpents
vali who calls himself your brother is your enemy and a doer of wrong deeds you will see him crushed like a mountain shattered by my arrows
on hearing ramas words sugriva chief of the army of monkeys experienced immeasurable happiness and exclaimed youre great youre great
rama i am overwhelmed with sorrow you are the refuge of the distressed as you are a friend i ventilate all my grief to you
i value your hand of friendship extended to me with fire as witness more than my very life i on my own offer my pledge of friendship
his vision blurred words choked with tears he was unable to speak further
quickly sugriva controlled his tears streaming fast like the rushing river with patience rama seated in front
effulgent sugriva controlled his tears wiped his bright eyes took deep breath and said to rama
o rama i was subjected to the harsh words of powerful vali in the past when he uprooted me from the kingdom and threw me out
i was robbed of my wife who is dearer than my own life all my friends were rounded up and imprisoned
o rama this evilminded one made several attempts to kill me the monkeys he sent to kill me were themselves killed
it is because of suspicion that i did not approach you every one is scared when there is ample reason to fear
only hanuman and other chiefs are helping me therefore i am surviving in spite of all difficulties
these monkeys out of love for me keep me protected from all sides they go out with me when it is necessary and stay back whenever i stop in order to guard me
o rama i tell you my story briefly it is not necessary to go into details my elder brother vali who is known for his prowess is my enemy
my sorrow will go only with his death my happiness and my life are also subject to his destruction
this what i had to tell you out of sorrow this is how my sorrow will end in joy and in sorrow your friend is your refuge
after hearing sugriva rama said i wish to know the actual cause of this enmity
on hearing the cause of your enmity and considering your strength and weakness i will take steps to make you happy
on hearing about your humiliation i feel highly agitated at heart i feel very much angry and restless like the water in rainy season
tell me freely and cheerfully before i string the bow your enemy will be destroyed as soon as i release my arrow
when the great rama said this sugriva with all the four monkeys felt immeasurably glad
with a smile on his face sugriva started narrating to lakshmanas elder brother the facts about the cause of his enmity with vali     thus ends the eighth sarga of kishkindakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
my elder brother called vali capable of exterminating enemies was always highly regarded by my father and me
i served him obediently like a servant while he ruled over the great ancestral kingdom inherited by him
dundubhis eldest son mayabi was a mighty demon he developed bitter enmity with vali for the sake of a woman
one midnight when all were asleep he mayabi came to the entrance of kishkinda screaming angrily and bellowing at vali challenging him to a duel
my brother vali who was asleep could not tolerate the frightful sound and jumped out of bed hastily
enraged he came out to kill the powerful demon even though i with the womenfolk of the harem tried to prevent him
that mighty warriorvali came out pushing aside all the womenfolk i too followed him due to my affection towards him
on seeing my brother and me from a distance the demon took to his heels scared
frightened he ran we too chased him running faster as the moon was rising the path was welllit
the demon entered into a hole cave covered with a heap of grass difficult therefore of access both of us reached there and took position
seeing the enemy entering the cave vali became wrathful and his senses were terribly disturbedhe said to me
o sugriva wait here at the entrance of the cave and be on your alert until i enter this hole and kill the enemy
on hearing him i begged the scorcher of enemies vali that i would follow him but he made me swear on his feet and entered the cave
thinking him dead i became agitated because of my love for him my mind began to apprehend his death since i had not seen my brother for long
i heard the roaring voices of the demons and not the yelling of my brother engaged in the duel
o friend by those signs i understood that my brother was killed and concluding that way i blocked the entrance of the cave with a rock of the size of a mountain and offered oblations to my brother and came to kishkinda i intended to hide the fact of valis death but the ministers came to know the truth with their efforts
then all the ministers assembled together and consecrated me while i was ruling the kingdom lawfully vali the monkey came back after killing the enemy demon
seeing me on the throne vali became angry and his eyes turned red he imprisoned my ministers and spoke to me harshly
o rama even though i was capable of restraining the sinner my intellect did not let me do so out of respect for my brother
when my brother came back to the town after killing the enemy i offered as usual my salutations to him but he did not bless me wholeheartedly
o lord i bowed at his feet with my crown in total submission even then vali was not pleased a bit      thus ends the ninth sarga of kishkindakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
i sought to appease my brother who arrived in an agitated state overpowered with anger
by providence you have come back safe and the enemy has been killed you are the only protector to an orphan which i am
here is the manyribbed parasol shining like the full moon above the horizon and the yaks tailfan held by mepray accept it
o king i waited at the entrance of the cave for a year as you did not come out i felt distressed and my heart sank in great sorrow seeing blood flowing out of the cave with my senses fused i returned to kishkinda closing the entrance with a rocklest the demon should come out
here i was consecrated by the people and ministers who saw me immersed in grief it was not my desire to be coronated therefore i may be forgiven
you alone are the king and worthy of reverencei will be the same old brother carrying out my work as earlier i held the responsibility of the state in your absence forced by the citizens and ministers the kingdom has been kept stable with the enemies destroyed
i am handing over this kingdom which was in trust o slayer of enemies o good natured one give up your anger against me
o king i bow my head and beg you with folded hands the ministers and citizens assembled and forced me to take charge as the kingdom without a ruler was vulnerable to attack
even tnough i spoke to him with affection vali abused me in many words saying fie on you
having invited ordinary people and favourite ministers he condemned me in the presence of friends
you know very well how that wicked demon mayabi that night challenged me angrily to a duel
on hearing his words i came out of the royal abode quickly followed by this wicked brother
the powerful demon that night saw me followed by another advancing towards him and fled out of fear when we chased him he entered this huge cave in great speed
when i saw the dreadful demon entering the great cave i instructed this cruel brother of mine
i cannot return from here without killing him wait at the entrance of the cave until i kill him look forward to my return
presuming that sugriva was waiting there i entered the formidable cave while i was searching for the demon there one year passed
i could find that fearful enemy there and killed him along with his relatives without any difficulty
when there was no response from sugriva to my repeated call in distress i was very sad
i kicked the boulder again and again till it yielded i came out that way and arrived at the city
i was obstructed by wicked sugriva who forgot his brotherly love and was desiring the kingdom which belongs to me
when vali the monkey spoke that way i remained unperturbed he banished me with the only cloth i was wearing
o rama my wife has been usurped there is the fear of his attack so i am roaming this entire earth covered with forests and oceans
tormented by the abduction of my wife by vali i came to the great rishyamuka mountain inaccessible to vali for some other reason
o rama i have given you this long full account of the cause of our enmity for no fault of mine i am suffering
o great warrior you are one who can frighten the entire world due to the fear of vali i seek your graceyou may resist vali and provide me security
having thus addressed by sugriva the righteous and glorious rama with a gentle smile consistent with righteousness started speaking
these my sharp unfailing arrows bright as the sun released by me out of anger will descend on the evildoer vali
that sinful vali who has abducted your wife and violated the moral code will live only as long i do not see him
inferring from my own experience i see that you are immersed in an ocean of sorrowi will help you cross over and fulfil your desire
on hearing his words that boosted his joy and vigour sugriva was immensely pleased and said these warm words     thus ends the tenth sarga of kishkindhakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
the words of rama boosted sugrivas joy and manliness he offered him prayers and praise
there is no doubt that your sharp blazing arrows will pierce through the vital parts of the body once you are angry just as the sungod burns all worlds at the end of the yuga
in the early hours before sunrise vali crosses over the oceans from the west to the east and moving from south to north performing sandhya without getting fatigued
climbing up speedily valiant vali would catch the huge mountain peaks
vali would break several sturdy trees in the forest with his vigour and speed exhibiting his strength
massive like the shining peak of mount kailas and valiant like the mightybuffalo in form dundubhi possessed the strength of a thousand elephants
wicked dundubhi of huge body was proud of his valour and deluded by virtue of the boons went to the ocean the lord of rivers
reaching the mighty ocean he implored the sea with high waves and hoards of gems for a fight
o king then the powerful and righteous king of the ocean came out and spoke to the demon dundubhi who was driven to death by fate
you are proficient in warfare i am not competent enough to challenge you to a duel but i will name the one who can
himavan the supreme abode of ascetics is the fatherinlaw of lord siva he is wellknown as king of mountains who has waterfalls caves caverns and great forestshe is competent to match your incomparable love for war
dundubhi the most powerful of demons aware that the ocean is frightened of him went swiftly to himavan like an arrow released from a bow he raised many huge white cliffs of the size of great elephants to the ground and roared
then the gentle himavan of pleasing appearance stood in the form of a white cloud on the peak and spoke
dundubhi it is not proper for you to trouble me for i am devoted to righteousness i am the resort of ascetics and not adept in warfare
if you are unable or unwilling to fight me out of fear tell me who wants to challenge me to a duel
on hearing such words which no one had spoken earlier righteous himavan skilful in conversation flew into a rage and said to dundubhithe best of demons
vali son of indra is a wise powerful and prosperous monkey he resides at kishkinda a city of incomparable glory
vali is profoundly wise an expert in warfare he is capable of challenging you to a duel like indra to namuchi
if you wish to fight go to him quicklyhe is ever heroic and difficult to combat
having heard himavan dundubhi seized with anger went to kishkindha the city of vali
mighty dundubhi assuming the form of a frightening buffalo with pointed horns looking like a huge dark raincloud in the sky in monsoon marched to the entrance of kishkinda and roared like a wardrum as if shaking the earth
dundubhi felled the trees nearby rent the earth with its hoofs scratched the entrance gate of the city as an elephant would do with its horns in arrogance
unable to tolerate the sound vali jumped out of the harem along with the women like the moon with stars
vali king of the monkeys who roam the forest saw dundubhi and addressed but briefly
o dundubhi why are you roaring blocking the entrance of the city i know you are powerful go and save your life
dundubhi whose eyes turned red in anger when he heard the words of vali the wise king of the monkeys said
o hero speaking such words in the presence of women is not proper come to me for a combat and i will let you know your strength
o monkey i will restrain my anger tonight and give you time for your indulgence in sensual pleasures till morning
o king of monkeys hug them and give them any gift you want spend the night with your dear ones
have a good look a kishkinda assign some one like you kingship sport freely with women and come i shall destroy your arrogance
whoever kills a person who is drunk or is heedless or is asleep or without weapons or stupified by lust in this world is equal to a killer of a foetus in the womb
then vali sent away tara and all other women slowly and replied angrily to the foolish demon with a mischievous smile
do not consider me drunken this drink will serve as a warriors drink in the combat be ready if you are not afraid of a combat
having addressed thus in a rage vali removed the golden garland gifted by indra his father and stood ready for the combat
vali the elephantlike monkey then held the mountainlike dundubhi by the horns and struck him down roaring loudly
vali whirled him round and round and threw him downroaring blood flowed from dundubhis ears
each one of them was highly agitated and angry trying to win over the other a terrific fight took place between dundubhi and vali
then vali who was equal to indra in prowess fought hitting him with fists knees rocks and trees
then as the monkey and demon fought pouncing on each other the prowess of dundubhi got diminished and that of vali the son of indra increased
in the fight dundubhi fell down with his strength courage and prowess dwindled vali lifted his huge body and dashed it down on the ground the body of dundubhi dissolved into the five elements
mighty vali lifted on both shoulders the insensate body drained of life and hurled it speedily to a distance of a yojana
scattered by the wind drops of blood fell at the hermitage of matanga from the mouth of the deadbody flung
the venerable sage became furious to see drops of blood fallen there he started thinking who could he be
who is that petty wicked evil minded one who caused the drops of blood to touch fall on me suddenly
the venerable sage came out of the hermitage and saw a mountaneous buffalo fallen dead on the floor
having known through his ascetic vision that it was the act of a monkey he pronounced a curse on vali who had hurled the body
whoever has desecrated this forest protected by me with drops of blood is forbidden to enter this place once he does it he will die
whoever has broken the trees all over this forest and has thrown the demons body will not survive if he enters within a radius of one yojana of my hermitage
indeed his counsellors who are here must leave this forest let them depart safely
if the monkeys stay back to destroy the leaves and shoots and plunder the fruits and roots of this forest which i have protected just like my son will also certainly invite my curse
i give one days time for the monkeys to leave whomsoever i see tomorrow will get transformed into a mountain for many thousands of years
the monkeys fled on hearing the words spoken by the sage said vali
why have you residents of the groves of matanga come to me hope all are safe
then all the monkeys collected together and narrated everything about the curse given to vali adorned with a golden chainon his neck
on hearing the monkeys vali went to the sage and begged forgiveness with folded hands
the sage went into the hermitage without obliging vali who became apprehensive of the curse of the sage
o lord rama because of the fear of the curse vali will not enter the great rishyamuka mountain nor will he like to see it
o rama aware of the prohibition of vali from entering the place i roam about this great forest accompanied by my ministers without any apprehension
hurled with the pride of hisvalis prowess is this heap of bones of dundubhi here which shines like a huge mountain peak
look at these seven sturdy sala trees with branches of one overlapping the other vali was able to remove all the leaves of one sala tree with just one arrow
o rama valis strength and fame related by me is unequalled o king how is it possible for you to kill him in a combat
smiling lakshmana asked sugriva by what action will you trust by the fulfilment of which task by rama will you have faith
then sugriva told lakshmana that earlier vali had split through these seven sala trees one after the other several times
if i see rama splitting these trees with one arrow i will believe he can kill vali with his prowess
o lakshmana and if rama can also lift the dead buffalos dundubhis skeleton and hurl it to a distance of two hundred bows with one of his feet
having said this and thinking for a moment sugriva again said to the heroic rama whose eyes had turned red
powerful vali is valiant and has killed brave fighters he is wellknown for his prowess and valour he has not faced defeat in war
even gods cannot do what he has done thinking of all this and being afraid of him i have taken refuge at rishyamuka
thinking that this indignant invincible lord of the monkeys cannot be overpowered i have not stepped out of rishyamuka
i have discovered in you a faithful friend o tiger among men o venerable one you are to me like the himalayas
what to do i know the strength of my mighty bad brother but so far i have not seen your power in a battle
the dreadful acts of vali have made me feel timid this is not to compare you with him or your strength with his or insult you and scare you
rama your word and your courage indicate your supreme strength which is like fire covered with ashes
having heard the great sugriva rama replied with a gentle smile
if you have no confidence in my strength in fight o monkey i will create it in you so much so that you will admire it
ramathe mighty elder brother of lakshmana having said so to sugriva in a pleasing manner lifted the dried body of dundubhi easily with his toe shook it and flung it with ease to a distance of ten yojanas
having seen rama flinging the body sugriva said to him again in the presence of lakshmanameaningfully
o friend when vali my brother flung the body he was tired and intoxicated and the body was fresh with flesh meaning heavy but now o delight of the raghu race it is fleshless and light like a bunch of dry grass for which you could throw it playfully
i was unable to gauge whether your strength is more than his valis since there is a great difference between a dry body and a wet one
o dear therefore i have my doubt about your relative strength if you can split a sala tree with a single arrow then can your strength or weakness be demonstrated
now string your bow draw it like the trunk of an elephant up to your ear and release the great arrow
it will be enough and my doubt will be cleared if you can pierce the sala tree with your arrow it will be my pleasure and not a test of your strength
just as the sun is the best among the brilliant the himalayas among the great mountains the lion among the quadrupeds so also you are the best among men of valour     thus ends the eleventh sarga of kishkindakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
having heard sugrivas pleasing words the brilliant rama took up the bow in order to inspire confidence in sugriva
rama subduer of the enemys pride strung his terrific bow produced the twang that filled all directions and discharged a single arrow aimed at the sala tree
released with great force ramas arrow embellished with gold pierced through the seven sala trees and splitting the mountain terrain entered the earth
in a moment the arrow emerged from the earth which it pierced and reentered the quiver with great speed
the chief of the monkeys was struck with wonder seeing ramas arrow piercing through the seven sala trees so swiftly
sugriva was immensely happy and offered obeisance to rama with folded hands and bowed down and prostrated while his ornaments touched the ground
sugriva who stood by elated to watch the deed of rama best among the valiant proficient in the use of arms of all kinds and knower of dharma said
o bull among men o lord you are capable of killing with your arrows even the gods including indra in the battle what to speak of vali
o rama who can in a battle confront you capable of splitting seven huge sala trees the mountain and the earth with a single arrow
having found a friend in you comparable to indra and varuna my grief is gone and i am so happy now
o rama for my pleasure kill vali who is to me an enemy in the guise of a brother i fold my hands to you
then wise rama embraced handsome sugriva and replied in these words which were agreeable to lakshmana
o sugriva get ready at once we will promptly proceed to kishkinda from here go ahead and challenge vali your brother only in name to a combat
thay all rushed to kishkinda the capital of vali and waited in the thick forest behind the trees
sugriva tightened up his waist cloth hurriedly and roared terrifically as though piercing the sky and screamed for vali
on hearing his brother roaring powerful vali was enraged and rushed like the sun from behind the western shore of the ocean this simile suggests the downfall of vali
then a tumultuous combat took place between vali and sugriva who looked like the planets mercury and mars
the brothers insensate with fury struck each other like thunder with their palms soles and fists in the combat
bow in hand rama watched both the heroes who resembled the twin aswini kumaras
since rama was not able to distinguish between vali and sugriva he could not decide whether he should discharge his deadly arrow
discomfited by vali and not seeing rama around sugriva ran towards rishyamuka mountain
exhausted disfigured and body mauled and drenched in blood all over sugriva chased by the infuriated vali entered the region of great sage matanga
effulgent vali saw sugriva entering the prohibited grove and turned back due to the fear of the curse of sage matanga saying you have escaped
rama together with lakshmana and hanuman also arrived at the same gave where sugriva was
at the sight of rama accompanied by lakshmana sugriva felt ashmed and aggrieved and looking down on the ground said
you demonstrated your prowess and directed me to challenge vali and then why did you make the enemy hit me thus
had you in fact told me that you were not going to kill vali i would not have budged from this place
on hearing the great sugrivas miserable and moving words rama again said
o dear sugriva dispel your anger and listen to me why i had not released the arrow
o sugriva in form ornaments and movements there is perfect resemblance between you and vali
o monkey in your voice in brightness in looks in valour or in words i have marked no difference between you
o distinguished monkey you both are so similar in form that i was puzzled and did not release my swift arrow that could have destroyed the enemy
i was doubtful because of your similar appearance i thought that i should not strike at the very root of the interests of both of us therefore i did not release the terrific and deadly arrow
o lord of monkeys i would have betrayed my foolishness and childishness had i exposed you to danger by my ignorance and thoughtlessness
it is said that killing a person to whom protection is promised is highly sinful lakshmana darling sita and me are under your care and you are our refuge
therefore o monkey go and engage yourself in fight again do not suspect me with this single arrow of mine in one moment you will see vali thrown down and rolling on the ground in this combat
o lord of monkeys while you both are engaged in a duel wear some identification mark by which i can recognise you
o lakshmana this gajapushpi in bloom is auspicious pluck and fasten it on great sugrivas neck
then lakshmana went to the mountain slope plucked the creeper with gajapuspi blossoms and fastened it on the neck of sugriva
with the creeper round the neck sugriva looked like the raincloud at twilight adorned by a row of cranes like a garland
radiant sugriva intent on carrying out ramas words again went to kishkinda ruled by vali     thus ends the twelfth sarga of kishkindakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
lakshmanas righteous elder brother left rishyamuka with sugriva for kishkinda protected by valis valour
getting ready to go rama took up his great bow and arrows adorned with gold and potent in war looking dazzling like the sun
the strongnecked sugriva and mighty lakshmana walked in front of the highsouled rama
brave and brilliant hanuman nala nila and tara among the leaders of the monkeys walked behind
they saw on the way trees bent down with the load of flowers and rivers with pure water flowing into the sea
they saw beautiful valleys mountains caves prominent peaks with deep caverns
observing on the way delightful lotus buds with leaves like vaidurya clear water and full tanks they moved on
ducks cranes swans vanjulas waterfowls chakravakas and other birds warbling melodiously
they observed deer feeding on tender grass on the ground around without fear some standing and some roaming the forest
observing terrific elephants adorned with white tusks wandering alone destroying the tanks shattering the banks
observing intoxicated elephants knocking the edges of mountain slopes elephants resembling dark rainbearing clouds elephants like moving mountains elephants with dust covered all over the body
following sugriva faithfully they proceeded swiftly observing animals of the forest and birds flying in the sky
while walking fast looking at the forest full of trees rama the delight of the raghus said to sugriva
this cluster of trees surrounded by plantain groves look splendid like a vast collection of clouds in the sky
o friend i wish to know what this is could you answer my curiosity
on hearing great ramas words while walking in the extensive forest sugriva started narrating
o raghava this is a hermitage enchanting with vast gardens and trees bearing sweet fruits full of tasty roots and water that relieves tiresomeness of travellers
these seven sages used to live on air and that too once in seven nights they lived for seven hundred years performing penance with motionlessness and attained heaven along with their bodies
by virtue of the power of their penance this hermitage surrounded by a row of trees is impenetrable even for demons and gods including indra
birds and wild animals avoid the hermitage and whoever enters there out of ignorance never returns
o rama one can hear pleasant sounds of jingling ornaments of nymphs of songs and windinstruments here one can inhale divine fragrance too
the three sacred fires keep burning and the thick smoke they emit resembles the red feet of pigeons it shines forth as if enveloping the treetops
these treetops covered with thick smoke glow like mountains of vaidurya concealed by a cluster of clouds
o rigteous rama you and your brother lakshmana humbly offer obeisance to themsacred hermitage and sages saptajana with folded hands and meditate on them
o rama nothing inauspicious happens to them who offer obeisance to those highly spiritual sacred sages
rama and lakshmana offered salutations with folded hands in memory of those great sages great souls
righteous rama lakshmana sugriva and all the monkeys offered obeisance and proceeded delighted at heart
walking a long distance from the hermitage of the seven seers they beheld the unassailable kishkinda ruled by vali
rama and lakshmana of fierce lustre and the monkeys took hold of the weapons to kill the enemy and reached the capital ruled by the valour of vali son of indra     thus ends the thirteenth sarga of kishkindakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
they all at once went to kishkinda ruled by vali and there waited hiding behind the trees in the dense forest
broadnecked sugriva a lover of the forest looked around and flew into a rage
sugriva surrounded by his companions raised his voice as if piercing the sky roaring like a huge thundering cloud challenging vali to a duel
sugriva proficient in the performance of any task one who appeared like the rising sun and moved like a proud lion said to rama
we have arrived at kishkinda the capital of vali decorated with flags and having a glittering golden archway that can be opened mechanically teeming with monkeys it looks like a snare to catch the enemy
o heroic rama fulfil quickly the vow taken by you earlier to kill vali in the same way a creeper bears fruit when the time comes
requested thus by sugriva righteous rama the destroyer of enemies replied
lakshmana has uprooted a creeper of gaja and fastened it on your neck by which you can be easily identified
o hero you are shining with the creeper fastened to your neck just as the fullmoon adorned with a cluster of stars shines in the sky
o monkey with the release of a single arrow in the combat i shall dispel your fear and enmity hatred for vali
o sugriva show me your enemywho is in the guise of your brotherhe will be killed he will roll down in the dust of the forest
if vali appears before me i will not let him go with lifethen you will not blame me and find fault with me
you have seen how i have pierced through seven sala trees with a single arrow you will know how with the same strength i will kill vali
o sugriva i have uttered no falsehood before for fear of deviation from righteousness although i was in distress nor shall i utter any falsehood in any circumstances hereafter
i shall fulfil my promise just as indra who performed a hundred sacrifices helps production in the cornfield through timely rain give up your apprehension
o sugriva give a warcry so that vali adorned with a golden garland will come out
vali who is proud of his valour is strong fearless and fond of combat will rush out of the city in response to your challenge
proud of their own prowess heroes will not brook the challenge of foes in battle specially in the presence of women
on hearing ramas words the goldenhued sugriva roared in a fierce voice as if it would piece the sky
alarmed at the yelling of sugriva the cows began to run in all directions like the women of noble pedigree who with their brightness lost run perplexed for failure of the king to protect their chastity
the deer were unable to run like wounded horses in a battle birds fell down on the ground like planets fall when their merit is exhausted
then sugriva son of the sungod with his lustre enhanced by his valour moved swiftly his roar resembled the rumbling of a cluster of thundering clouds he gave a warcry the tone of which resembled the sounds of waves lashed by high velocity winds in the sea     thus ends the fourteenth sarga of kishkindakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
the indignant vali who was in the harem heard the roaring of his venerable brother sugriva
the roar of sugriva that frightened all beings gave valis vanity a jolt and at once aroused in him violent rage
overcome with anger vali looked pale like the eclipsed sun with the golden radiance faded from his face
vali who looked fierce with his teeth and whose eyes shone like a flaming fire through anger looked like a pond with the lotuses and their stalks uprooted
unable to tolerate sugrivas roar vali stepped out hurriedly taking long strides as if breaking the earth
tara perplexed out of fear glanced at vali lovingly embraced him and gave him wise counsel
o valiant vali anger has overtaken you like the flood of a river it is natural for you to be angry at this time but shake off your anger just as the wise discard a flower garland already used up
o monkey fight him only tomorrow morning by this you are not going to prove your weakness or increase your respect for the enemy
i do not like your rashness i will explain the reason i am preventing you listen
earlier he sugriva came and challenged you to a duel you struck him in anger and defeated he fled running in all directions now his challenge rouses my suspicion
one who is defeated and badly mauled by you is again coming and inviting you to a duel in this manner arouses suspicion in me
his determination his insolence his roaring his arroganceall this cannot be for a small reason
certainly sugriva has not come here to give a warcry without any external help the person whose refuge he has sought is not a small one
sugriva is clever by nature he is wise without assessing the ability of the ally he will not enter into friendship
o hero i have heard the news earlier from our son angada i will tell you what he had heard and what he has said to me
when our son angada was out into the forest he had collected some reports from the spies which he has transmitted to me
rama and lakshmana two heroic sons of the king of ayodhya born of the ikshvaku race are invincible in war they have come there to help sugriva
rama famous for crushing foes in war like the fire that breaks out at the dissolution of the world has slain strong enemies like khara and will help your brother
he is like a sheltering tree to the virtuous an ultimate refuge for the destitutes and a protector of the distressed he is the sole repository of fame
he is endowed with the knowledge of science and scriptures he stood by his fathers command he is like a mine of virtues just as the lord of the mountain is a mine of minerals
rama is immeasurable in prowess and unconquerable in war therefore enmity with him is not desirable for you
o hero this i tell you not because i dislike you but because i wish your welfare listen and do as i say
o king o hero consecrate your brother sugriva as prince at once do not create enmity with him
leave enmity with sugriva far behind make friendship with rama i think it is the right thing for you
this monkey is your younger brother and therefore deserves your protection whether he is here or there he is your brother
indeed i do not see any of your relatives comparable to him on earth give up enmity with him give him wealth give him respect keep him by your side
extend your brotherly affection to broadnecked sugriva he is always your great relation there is no alternative for you other than this at present
pray do me this favour treat me as your wellwisher heed my advice given with care
do not lose your temper quieten your mind my advice is beneficial to you you should not fight with the prince of kosala who is comparable to indra in splendourit is not proper for you
even though tara gave good counsel to vali at the hour of destruction the advice did not find favour with him as he was under the influence of unfavourable time seized by death     thus ends the fifteenth sarga of kishkindakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
to these words of tara with her moonlike face vali replied reproachfully
o lady with a charming face why should i tolerate the enemy sugriva who is none other than my own younger brother especially when he roars excitedly
o timid lady to swallow insult without facing the opponent is worse than death for indomitable heroes like me who know no retreat in a battle
when the weaknecked sugriva roars eager to join a duel it is not right on my part to tolerate his arrogancemuch less his warcry
you need not be concerned about me on account of rama how can one who knows dharma and who has a sense of gratitude commit sin
go back with all the women of the harem why do you follow me again your devotion towards me is evident from the sincere concern expressed by you
i shall accept the challenge and fight with sugriva give up your anxiety i will destroy his pride not his life
when he faces me in the battlefield i will hit him with trees and fists and he will run back for life
that evilminded sugriva cannot bear my mighty hard blows tara you could shower your affection on me and extend help in passing secret information obtained through angada
i make a vow even on my life and my victory pray return with the retinue i will be back only after winning the encounter with my brother
pleasing in her words tara then embraced vali and sobbing circumambulated vali in compliance to his advice
the wise counsellor tara bade him farewell wishing him victory and then overwhelmed with sorrow entered the inner apartment followed by the womenfolk
after tara and other women returned to their abode vali departed from the city hissing like a huge angry cobra
the mighty vali breathing heavily looked around to find where his enemy was
there vali saw sugriva in lustrous red gold complexion standing ready for a combat steady like glowing fire
on seeing the great hero sugriva standing firmly the enraged vali tied his upper cloth around his loin tightly
vali tied up his cloth tightly raised his fist and advanced towards sugriva ready for the encounter
sugriva also lifted his fist firmly and advanced more impatiently towards vali adorned with a golden necklace
while sugriva expert in combat advanced swiftly to pounce upon his enemy vali whose eyes turned red in anger said
this infuriated sugriva who looking at vali said this fist of mine will draw your life out hitting your forehead
struck by vali enraged sugriva encountered vali more aggresively his body drenched in blood seemed a mountain with rivulets of blood flowing
with all his vigour sugriva uprooted a sala tree pulled it out and struck vali on the body like a thunderbolt striking a huge mountain
struck by the blows of the sala tree vali also lost his balance like the heavily loaded ship of a trader shaken up in the ocean
both of them endowed with terrible strength fierce in appearance and each seeking the weak points of the other advanced as fast as garuda striking at the enemy their fight grew more and more fierce like the fight between sun and moon in the sky
in a short while vali endowed with great strength gained the upper hand and sugriva son of the sungod was losing ground
with his strength waning and pride crushed sugriva anguished exhibited shrewdness
both like vritra and indra fought hitting each other again and again with trees full of branches and tops with their hard nails akin to thunderbolts and with their fists knees feet etc
the monkeys wanderers in the forest both with blood stains fiercely clashed pointing at each other roaring with dreadful sounds like two clouds
raghava perceived that the monkey king sugriva whose strength was waning was looking again and again in all directions seeking help
finding the king of the monkeys in distress the heroic brilliant rama looked for an arrow in order to kill vali
rama then fixed an arrow which resembled a venomous snake on to his bow looking like the very deathwheel of yama and stretched it fully
as if scared by the twang of the bowstring winged and feathered birds and animals ran frightened in different directions
as rama shot the mighty arrow it went like a blazing lightning with a thunderous sound and pierced into the chest of vali
then the powerful monkey king vali who was proud of his might fell down on earth struck by the fast flying arrow
vali fell lustreless on the ground he was thrown down unconscious like the banner hoisted in honour of indra on the fullmoon day of aswayuja month
the arrow of rama distinguished among men adorned with silver and gold which could crush the enemy shone like fire and smoke emitted from the mouth of rudra at the time of dissolution at the end of the aeon
a tyrant in war vali struck by ramas arrow collapsed instantaneously like a tree felled down
adorned with shining gold ornamentsvali fell down with all his limbs touching the ground like indras flag when its ropes are loosened
when the lord of the monkey troops fell down it was as though the earth lost its brightness like the sky loses its brightness devoid of the moon
even though the highsouled valis body had fallen on the ground its splendour glow life and valour had not left it
as the most beautiful golden necklace studded with diamonds given by indra was there on him the life brightness and splendour of valis body remained
vali the chief hero of the monkeys with his golden necklace appeared like the raincloud hallowed by the glowing twilight
even though he had fallen down the effulgence of his necklace on his body and the arrow pierced into his vital parts remained
ramas arrow released paved the way to heaven which was that heros supreme destination
rama followed by lakshmana slowly approached the longarmed lionchested brightfaced tawnyeyed vali and admiringly observed this unchallengeable son of indra unassailable like indra himself adorned with a golden necklace he had fallen on the ground like fire without flame like king yayati descended on the earth from the celestial realm on the exhaustion of his merits or like the sun cast down on the earth at the end of the aeon
on seeing powerful rama and lakshmana approachingvali spoke with pride and rigteousness to rama you are a prince born of a noble family son of a renowned king you are famous brilliant handsome and follower of good practiceshaving hit me when i was engaged otherwise in an encounter what merit have you gained
o king selfcontrol of organs of action and sense organs righteousness steadfastness truthfulness valiance and capacity to punish the offenders are virtues of a king
believing that you are a repository of all these virtues are in you and respecting your noble lineage i engaged in a duel with sugriva even though i was forewarned by tara
i did not know that you have killed your soul by acting against your conscience that you are sinful in conduct and unrighteous under the show of virtues like a well its mouth covered with grass
you are a sinful man covered with the mask of piety thus resembling a hidden fire i failed to recognise that righteousness is a mere pretext for you
i did no harm to your affairs or to your city i did not insult you why did you choose to kill me a monkey roaming in the forest and living on fruits and roots i was not fighting you why did you come and strike a person like me
o prince you are son to a king handsome and famous even signs of righteousness are discernible in you
who born in a kshatriya family versed in the vedas and free from doubt will commit such a cruel act under the guise of righteousness
you are born in a royal family you are wellknown you are proficient in dharma yet you are unworthy of your race and robe
conciliation generosity forbearance righteousness truthfulness steadfastness in valour and punishing offenders are the hallmarks of rulers
o rama we are mere animals wandering in the forest and living on roots and fruits this is our nature but you are a lord of men
we fight for land or gold or silver what did you fight me for for what i have or for the fruits of the forest
submissiveness and modesty are the attributes of good rulers and should not be mixed up with benevolence and selfrestraint kings ought not to act as they like impulsively
fulfilling your own desire is important for you you are wrathful and unstable with royal course of conduct your business is with your bow and arrows
o lord of men you have no faith in righteousness no steadfastness in the acquisition of wealth you have no control over the senses you are overcome by delusion
o scion of the kakutsthas having killed me here with your arrow even though i have done you no harm you have perpetrated an abominable act how will you defend yourself in the midst of holy men after commiting such a sinful act
one who kills a king a brahmin or a cow a thief or one who delights in destruction of life an atheist or one who marries before his elder they all go to hell
my skin is not fit to be worn by the virtuous my hair and bones are also prohibited from any use my flesh is also not at all fit to be eaten by righteous people like you
o rama brahmins and kshatriyas are permitted to eat only the five nailed animals the porcupine the hedgehog the alligator the rabbit and the tortoise
o king the learned do not even touch my skin or bone they do not eat my flesh while it is so you have unnecessarily killed me a fivenailed animal
tara knew everything her words were correct they were meant for my wellbeing however due to my ignorance or arrogance i did not heed her words and fell under the sway of the lord of death
o kakutstha just as a wife endowed with good character cannot be protected by a wicked husband you cannot be a protector of this earth
you are treacherous dishonest mean guised with false humility and a sinner to the core how were you born to that highsouled dasaratha
breaking through the chains of good character trespassing the moral code of conduct of the sages discharging the sharp arrow of righteousness the elephantine arrogant rama killed me
you have committed an inauspicious improper act despised by the virtuous what will you speak when you are questioned by noble men for committing such an act
o king you have exhibited your valour against one who has done you no harm why have you not shown such valour on those who have offended you
o prince had you fought me face to face you would have seen vaivasvata the lord of death today you would have been killed by me
bitten to death by a snake while fast asleep
had you sought my help earlierbefore you met sugriva i would have restored sita to you within a single day i have been killed by you to oblige sugriva i would have handed over ravana by the neck after killing him in the battle
even if she were hidden in the waters of the ocean or in the underworld i would have brought her by your order like sweta to aswatari or hayagriva hayagriva an incarnation of visnu brought vedas stolen by demons madhu and kaitabha from patala or the netherworld
sugriva inheriting the kingdom after my departure to heaven is proper but your killing me this way in the combat by unjustifiable means is not
indeed in the world people meet with death when the time comes hiding yourself from me you have achieved it is it proper for you you may think over and give your reply
to these harsh words though seemingly wellmeaning courteous and righteous vali who had been mortally wounded and confused in mind rama replied
to righteous valithe best of the monkeys the lord of the monkeys who looked like the sun shorn of his brilliance or a raindrained cloud or a fire that had been extinguished rama under the scanner said in reply
without correct knowledge of dharma artha kama and worldly ways how do you reproach me bitterly now in total ignorance
o gentle vali why do you speak with monkeyish frivolousness without consulting the elders and teachers endowed with intelligence
this earth including mountains groves and forests animals birds and humans belongs to the ikshvaku kingsthe right of purnishment and reward also vests with them
bharata righteous truthful upright knower of dharma artha and kama and dispenser of punishment and rewards rules this earth
bharata in whom justice and discipline truth and courage along with the knowledge of time and place for action are firmly rooted is king of this earth
following his command in confirmity with dharma we and the other kings also move all over the entire world desirous of promoting dharma
who can stray from the path of dharma when the whole world is ruled by bharata a tiger among kings and a lover of dharma
by the command of bharata all of us are devoted to our duty of upholding dharma and virtue and duly punish those who deviate from the path of dharma
you have violated dharma you stand condemned for your actions passion is your priority you have strayed from the right path of kings
o monkey dharma is very subtle it is extremely difficult to understand installed in the hearts of all living beings the self knows good and evil soul is the witness of good and evil
you are fickle by nature your consultants are frivolous pettyminded monkeys it is like one born blind suppporting another blind by birth what do you know about dharma
i shall explain to you clearly the reason for striking you down it is not proper for you to despise me with mere anger and malice
now know the reason why i struck you down having abandoned the eternal law you are living with your younger brothers wife
you are a sinner since you live with ruma who is your virtual daughterinlaw when the great self sugriva is alive a younger brother is like a son and his wife a daughterinlaw
o monkey since you have violated morality by sinning against your brothers wife this punishment is justified
o lord of monkeys i do not see any other way of controlling a person excepting punishing the one who has acted against dharma and swerved from the accepted code of conduct
i am a kshatriya born of a good family i will not pardon you for your sin whosoever transgresses dharma against his own daughter sister or brothers wife out of lust should be killed according to smriti
bharata is a king and we follow his command how can you who have strayed from dharma go unpunished
wise bharata being a respectable king rules by dharma by the command of bharata we are bent upon punishing those who have strayed from dharma by being addicted to sensual pleasures
o vali we have to follow bharatas command and are bent upon punishing those wicked people who deviate from the bounds of dharma
my friendship with sugriva is as strong as that with lakshmana its motive is the recovery of his wife and sovereignty i have promised this to him in the presence of monkeys how can a pledge remain unhonoured by a person like me how is it possible
knowing all these reasonsmany violations of dharma it is proper for you as a king to approve of the punishment accorded to you in consonance with dharma
punishment given to you should be viewed as a right course of action in all respects this is the duty of a trustworthy friend who follows dharma
you should also have acted in that manner considering dharma now listen to what manu said in two verses that hold good traditions dear which are accepted by men wellversed in dharma o monkey the action taken by me is in conformity with this
men who have perpetrated sins should be subjected to punishment by kings so that they become stainless and attain heaven like pious men who have performed good deeds
in the past a similar sin was perpetrated by sramana a revered soul mendicant and mandhata a noble king of my race inflicted terrible punishment on him
vicious deeds have been committed by others when the kings were not watchful kings punish such sinners when they are vigilant otherwise they have to atone for their negligence
o tiger among monkeys do not regret your death has the sanction of dharma we are under the control of sastras we are committed to them we do not have the freedom to act independently
o hero o best of monkeys listen to me i will give you one more reason on hearing it i hope you would not be angry with me
o best of monkeys i have no mental agony nor do i regret in this case hidden from view or out in the open people catch animals by means of snares or ropes or through other tricks
people seeking animal flesh for food kill animals alarmed or unalarmed animals that run away or animals that stand still they kill animals whether they are alert or not and no blemish is attached
o monkey even royal saints wellversed in dharma go for hunting i struck you down with an arrow whether you were fighting with sugriva or not since you are a monkey you can be hit whether you are fighting face to face or not
o best of monkeys kings are donors of dharma life and auspiciousness to people which is difficult to acquire there is no doubt about it
one should not insult kings nor shout at them nor disregard them nor speak unpleasant words to them they are gods in human form moving on this earth
seized with improper anger you are reproaching one who is devoted to dharma without knowing that i follow the code of conduct that has been passed on by my fathers and forefathers
vali was very much pained to hear rama he became free from confusion regarding dharma and no longer found fault with rama
thereafter vali offered obeisance with folded palms to rama saying o best among men whatever you have spoken is undoubtedly true
in progress
you are a wise man given to truth and righteousnessyou remain devoted to peoples wellbeing as you know for certain about cause and effect your intellect is sound and words pleasant
o knower of dharma i did not follow dharma in the past i have trangressed the bounds of dharma say you have pardoned me protect me in a righteous manner
i neither grieve for myself nor for tara nor for my kinsmen but i do for my son angada adorned with golden armlets he is embellished with all virtues
i loved him very much from his childhood he will grow depressed in my absence he will become like a pond whose waters have been dried up
o rama he is my only son through tara and dear to me he is younginnocent but stronghe deserves to be protected by you
shower equal affection from your heart on sugriva and angada you are their protector and punisher also you know what should and should not be done
o lord of men may you have the same kind of affection for sugriva and angada as you have for bharata and lakshmana
i hope tara will not be made to suffer because of my offence make sugriva not to run wretched tara down
it is possible for a person favoured by you to rule the kingdomit is possible for one who is under your control and acts according to your will to rule the entire world and earn heaven
even though i was prevented by tara i came for a duel with sugriva since i wished to die in your hands having spoken thus to rama vali fell silent
now vali was able to see clearly rama consoled him with words of peace and tranquillity truth and righteousness
o best of monkeys abandon all your anxiety on this score bother not about us or about yourself whatever has happened has happened in consonance with dharma
the sinner and the punisher whoever gives punishment and whoever receives it are both regulated by the law of cause and effect so do not despair
you have been purged of your sin through punishment from the point of view of righteousness you have regained your spiritual nature on the path of dharma
o best of monkeys remove sorrow from your heart delusion and fear it is not possible for you to transgress fate
o lord of monkeys angada will remain with sugriva and with me as he used to live with you rest assured
having listened to the sweet wellcomposed words of great rama a crusher of the enemy in war follower of righteous path vali replied in appropriate manner
pray o mighty prince hero of immense valour pardon me for the words of blame i unwittingly hurled at you i said all that in excruciating pain caused by your mighty arrow and in confusion of what is right and what is wrong     thus ends the eighteenth sarga of kishkindakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
the king of monkeys lying on the ground struck by the arrow did not offer to reply after listening to ramas appropriate answers to his objections
severely battered by stones hit by trees and pierced by ramas arrow vali lost consciousness as the end of his life was nearing
tara wife of vali heard that her husband tiger among monkeys was killed in the battle by the arrow discharged by rama
hearing the terrible unhappy news of her husbands death tara anxiously rushed along with her son out of the mountain cave
alarmed at the sight of rama holding the bow the terribly courageous monkeys who followed angada as his bodyguards ran in different directions
tara saw the terrorstricken monkeys running helterskelter like the herd of deer whose leader who had strayed had been killed
sorrowful tara the wife of vali duly approaching the monkeys stricken with grief and running as if chased by the arrows of rama at their back said to them
o monkeys deserting the lion among kingswhose servants you are what should you be frightened for why run away in distress
if the elder brother is struck down by his younger brother in anger for the sake of kingship using farreaching arrows discharged by rama why are you running
on hearing tara the wife of vali the monkeys who could assume any form at their will replied with clear words appropriate to the occasion
o mother your son is still alive go back and protect your son angada lord of death in the form of rama has come and killed vali and is carrying him away
rama smashed the trees and stones vali hurled at him and then struck him down with thunderboltlike arrows
when vali who was equal to indra in strength a tiger among monkeys was killed the army of monkeys got terrified and ran away here and there scattered in different directions
let the gate of the city be shut and valis son be consecrated as king all the monkeys will serve him when he assumes power
o lovely tara this very day other monkeys will soon occupy our citadels
there are monkeys wandering in the forest sent away by vali some of them have made others wives their own and some have been separated from their wives they are a great cause of fear
hearing the words of the pettyminded monkeys tara spoke to them in her own way with a gentle smile
now that the glorious vali a lion among monkeys my husband is dying of what purpose is the son or the kingdom or my own life
i will seek the soles of the feet of the great soul who has been killed by the arrow discharged by rama
so saying the griefstricken weeping tara hastened sadly beating with both hands her head and her chest
as she was nearing the spot she saw her husband a great conqueror of monkeys who never retreated from the battle mortally hit and fallen on the ground
vali who used to hurl huge mountains like indra discharges thunderbolts who had the speed of wind of high velocity who would roar like huge thundering clouds
vali who was equal to indra in prowess looked like a huge monsoon cloud that had calmed down after pouring all water a roaring warrior who could frighten others struck down by another warrior appeared like a lion killed by a tiger for the sake of meat
vali looked like a chaitya a tree of worship having a banner and altar and reverentially worshipped by the entire world but destroyed by garuda on account of a serpent hidden in it here rama is garuda sugriva serpent and vali a sacred chaitya
the auspicious lady tara beheld rama standing there firmly with his brother and sugriva leaning on the best of bows
passing rama and lakshmana she went near her husband killed in the combat she was full of agony to see him deeply agitated in the mind she fell down on the ground
tara got up again as if she woke up from sleep and addressing her husband garlanded with death lamented
seeing tara crying like a female osprey and angada following her in despair sugriva felt pain at heart     thus ends the nineteenth sarga of kishkindakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
beholding her husband lying on the ground pierced by a deathdealing arrow released by rama the lovely moonfaced tara went and embraced him
beholding vali the lord of monkeys who was strong as an elephant splendid as a mountain fallen down like an uprooted tree struck by the arrow tara became restless and wailed bitterly
o valiant hero lord of monkeys you were terrifying in war why dont you speak now to me so forlorn and helpless
o tiger among monkeys get up come and sleep on the best of beds best of kings you should not lie on the ground
o lord of the earth i know you loved the earth more than you loved me since you have forsaken me and enjoy her company by hugging her with your limbs even after death
o my heroic husband you are the legitimate righteous king of kiskinda you have evidently built another beautiful city kiskinda on your way to heaven
our pleasure trips to sweetscented forests have ended now you have brought them to a close
you are the leader of leaders now that you have attained heaven i am bereft of all joy plunged in a sea of grief
i presume my heart is strong for it has not broken into a thousand pieces even though i am overwhelmed with grief to see my husband fallen on the ground
o king of monkeys you have banished sugriva you have usurped his wife this is the fruit of your action
o lord of monkeys wishing your wellbeing i tendered salutary advice but out of delusion you despised them
o venerable one you will surely churn the minds of the kindhearted celestial nymphs who are endowed with youth and beauty
no doubt time is inexorable the time of your death had surely arrivednow you whom nobody could control have come under the sway of sugriva
i have not experienced poverty or suffering before immersed in grief like an orphan now i am reduced to the pitiable condition of a widow
to what plight will the tender angada who has been tended affectionately and deserves comforts be reduced when his uncle displays anger
turning to angada tara said o son look at your father a lover of dharma see him as it will be difficult to see him later dear
o lord you have set out on a long journey kiss your son on the forehead enjoy its sweet smell console him and give him your message
indeed rama has achieved a great feat in fulfilling his promise to sugriva he is acquitted of the debt by killing you
now turning to sugriva she said o sugriva your enemy brother has been killed and your desire has been fulfilledyou will get back ruma and enjoy the kingdom without any obstacles
to vali she said o lord of monkeys why dont you speak to me loving words when i am wailing this way here are your excellent wives
on hearing the wailing of tara all the other wives of vali held the piteous in their arms angada and wailed overwhelmed with sorrow
o hero adorned with armlets why have you departed on a long journey deserting your dear son angada who possesses similar virtues like you it is not proper
o darling attractively dressed you are leaving me and angada and going too far what unpleasant deeds we have done to deserve this
o longarmed chief of the monkey clan o warrior pardon me any wrong done unknowingly inconsiderately i touch your feet with my head
thereafter hanuman leader of the monkey clan slowly consoled tara who was standing before her husband like a star fallen from the sky
on departing from this mortal world an embodied soul reaps gradually the good and evil fruits of action performed under the notion of virtue or vice with an eye to their good or evil consequences
for whom do you grieve except for yourself you are miserable who are you sympathising with who are you grieving for when this body itself is like a bubble who is worth grieving for
you are mother of a surviving son angada you have to look after him in times to come think of the duties to be performed now
you are aware of the uncertain and transient happenings in the lives of living beings therefore a wise lady should do auspicious work in this world
tens of millions of monkeys depended on this hero with their hopes on him he has reached his ultimate destiny now to enjoy the fruits of his good deeds
this hero with a right vision adopted the means of conciliation charity and forgiveness in his administration and has finally reached a position through righteousness in his death it is not proper to mourn for him
o blemishless lady these great monkeys including your son angada and the entire kingdom of monkeys and bears are under your protection
o fair sex encourage these two griefstricken heroes angada and sugriva gently let angada rule this earth under your protection
let all the rituals of the king of vanaras be performed let angada be consecrated you will attain peace of mind to see your son seated on the throne
on hearing hanumans words tara tormented by the death of her husband said to hanuman who was waiting for her reply
to embrace even the deadbody of this hero is better than to embrace a hundred prototypes of angada
o hanuman the best of monkeys you need not think about the future of angada a father plans for a son and not even the mother
there is nothing more befitting for me than joining the king of monkeys either here or in the next world it is proper for me to resort to this resting place pyre used by this slain hero in front of me     thus ends the twentyfirst sarga of kishkindakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
vali gazing all around breathing slowly and sighing feably beheld sugriva at first instance sugriva who was standing in front of his own son
vali the lord of monkeys lovingly said to sugriva who had won a victory
o sugriva you ought not to accuse me of exiling you and wresting your wife my mind was deluded by the force of fate that controls ones future
o dear i believe that both of us are not destined to enjoy the love and happiness that come together to brothers
i am leaving this world soon along with this vast kingdom prosperity and untarnished fame
o warrior king you should do whatever i request you at this hour even though it may not be easy
look at this young angada fallen on the ground face flooded with tears raised with comfort he deserves to be kept happy
he is dearer to me than my life take care of him like your own son he is separated from me take care of him in all respects so that he is not deprived of anything
o lord of monkeys from now on you alone will be his father provider of everything saviour and protector in danger
this prosperous son of tara your equal in valour will remain with you in the forefront to crush demons
this mighty hero angada son of tara is young and dynamic he will strike the enemy in a fitting manner in war
tara daughter of sushena is wise and efficient in discerning subtle matters and in foreseeing unexpected events
taras opinion is never wrong it does not change whatever she speaks is right and should be carried out without any doubt
you ought to carry out ramas work without hesitation if you do not it will be unrighteous and harmful
o sugriva put on this divine golden necklace it has great brilliance its present lustre may be gone when i am dead
thus spoken to by vali with brotherly affection sugriva gave up joy of victory and appeared dull like the moon eclipsed by planet rahu
on hearing valis words sugriva became composed with no illfeeling considering it to be proper he received with his permission the golden necklace
having given the golden necklace to sugrivavali feeling ready to depart looked at his son angada who stood by and spoke affectionately
enduring pleasure or pain equally with due regard to time and place favourable to you or otherwise you should submit to the will of sugriva
o longarmed one you have always been affectionately brought up by me sugriva may not rear you that way
o conqueror of foes do not align with his enemies or with the friends of his enemies remain selfrestrained and loyal to sugriva be subordinate to his will
you are not to be excessively friendly or otherise as both are serious mistakes therefore be insightful
having spoken this tormented by the arrow eyes popping out and his dreadful teeth ejected vali remained drained of life
then the best of the monkeys and their troop leaders bewailed the death of vali crying bitterly
lord of monkeys having gone to heaven kishkinda looked desolate including the pleasure gardens the mountains and forests the monkeys also became dull
the vanaras wailed aloud saying the forests and gardens looked connected together with the flowers that swayed by his speed who can do that now
great soul vali endowed with stout shoulders joined a duel with a gandharva called golabha for fifteen years nonstop night and day
in the sixteenth year golabha the uncontrollable enemy was killed by vali with his dreadful fangs and rendered protection to everybody how did he get killed
just as the cattle get frightened when the leader of the herd gets killed in a huge forest full of lions the young monkey became puzzled when the chief of monkeys got killed
tara kissed smelt the forehead of the king of monkeys who had departed and said
o hero not caring for my words of caution you are now lying with great pain on hard stones on the ground
o lord of monkeys you lie in the end embracing the earth and not replying to me surely you deem this earth dearer than me
o lover of brave deeds fate has brought you under the sway of sugriva although he had lost to you
oh powerful vali leaders of the bears and monkeys the entire lot are standing near you wailing angada has been crying in grief how is it that you are not rising up even after hearing their wailing voices and my call
earlier you have killed enemies in combats and made them lie down where now you lie
o venerable hero born in a pure and noble family you are a lover of battles now you have left me an orphan
it is said by wise men that a girl should not be given in marriage to a warrior see me the wife of a warrior now rendered a widow
my pride is crushed my husband the ultimate resort for me is shatteredi am plunged in a vast bottomless ocean of grief
my heart is surely made of hard stone yet it has not split into a hundred pieces even on seeing my husband slain
he was my husband my friend and naturally my loving king he was powerful in battlealas the hero has died
even if a woman without husband is blessed with sons and abundant wealth and grain still learned people call her a widow
o hero how is it that you are lying in a crimson bed of the pool of blood flowing from your body
o bull among monkeys how can i embrace you with my arms as your body is covered with dust particles and blood
sugriva has achieved his goal in his dreadful enmity with you his fear is dispelled by a single arrow released by rama
the arrow which has pierced your body prevents me from embracing you i am only looking at you lying not removing the arrow lest you die
then nila took out the arrow from valis heart with due effort as one would pull out a glowing serpent hidden in the mountain cave
as the arrrowdrenched in blood was being pulled out its glow looked like the suns rays obstructed by the peak of the western mountain
the streams of blood that flowed all over from the wounds of his body appeared like streams of water mixed with red and copper colour
she tara wiped the body wounded with the weapon and covered with wardust sprinkling her tear drops from her eyes
turning to the body of her husband fully drenched in blood thus spoke tara to her tawnyeyed son angada
o son you see the most terrific end of your father on whom enmity forced sinful deeds
o son offer salutations to your venerable father the king departing for the abode of yama lord of death looking red with blood like the rising sun
thus advised by tara angada got up clasped his fathers feet with his stout arms and saluted saying i am angada
why do you not with the words may you live long bless as before your son angada who is greeting you said tara
just like a cow followed by its calf would attend upon a mighty bull struck by a lion i will wait with my son upon you who have lost consciousness died
you have performed a warsacrifice you have bathed in the waters of ramas weapon signifying the end of the sacrifice how did you take this customary bath without me your wife
why do i not see on your chest the golden necklace gifted by the king of the gods indra pleased with you in the battle
o venerable one even though life has departed from you kingly glory does not leave you any more than the light of the setting son leaves the king of mountains western mountain
you have not followed my advice i did not have the capacity to prevent you from going to war the result is you are killed and i am ruined along with my son the goddess of fortune also is deserting me as well as your son     thus ends the twentythird sarga of kishkindakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
sugriva the unassailable younger brother of vali perceiving tara overwhelmed in the ocean of grief felt agonized for the killing of his brother of incomparable power
face drenched with tears highly sensitive sugriva glanced at tara for a moment pained and depressed at heart and surrounded by attendants he slowly approached rama
duly approaching the illustrious rama endowed with auspicious signs who stood with his bow and serpentlike arrows sugriva thus submitted
your majesty you have struck down vali as promised and the consequences of your action are seen now o prince however my mind is not interested in the enjoyment of pleasures i have no interest in life
o rama when the queen tara is weeping plunged in deep sorrow the entire city is lamenting in agony my elder brother is dead and the survival of angada is uncertain my mind no longer longs for the enjoyment of the kingdom
o prince of the ikshvaku family the anger due to my exilement and my intolerance of his harsh words had made the killing of my brother agreeable to me earlier now that the leader of the monkey clan is killed i am intensely hurt
i now feel dwelling long on the great mountain rishyamuka as usual and somehow eking out a livelihood is preferable to attaining heaven as a sequel to the death of my brother
o rama when the wise highsouled vali said to me i do not like to kill you in this place be gone from here his words reflected his nobility this action of mine killing of vali is on the other hand in consonance with my nature
o rama prompted by passion without thinking of the difference between obtaining the kingdom to satisfy ones desire and the consequent grief which brother would be willing to kill his virtuous elder brother
the idea of killing me was not acceptable to his noble nature while my wicked thought caused his death
when my brother hit me with the branch of a tree i screamed for a while but he pacified me and said it was improper and he would not repeat it
thus while nobility a feeling of respectbrotherliness and duty was shown to me by my brother i exhibited wrath passion and frivolity the nature of the monkey
o king just as indra committed sin by killing tvashta i have reaped the sin by killing my brorther which is unthinkable avoidable undesirable and ignoble
trees owned the sin of indra and it was shared by the earth water and women voluntarilybut who is there to pardon a monkey and own the sin
o rama having acted in an unrighteous manner which destroys the clan i am not fit to accept the respect of people nor the status of a prince regent what to speak of kingship
i have committed a sin which is condemned by the world this intense grief has engulfed me just as the flow of rain water inundates the lowlying area when it rains
the elephant of sin hanging heavily on me has a tail of treacherous killing of ones own brother which has resulted in deep sorrow in the form of a trunk eyes head and tusksthis elephant is striking at me as he would strike the bank of a river when he grows strong and gets puffed up with the pride of energy the idea of a proud elephant striking at the target is superimposed on the sin committed by sugrivathe animals tail is the killing of a brother sugrivas remorse spreads all over the body trunk eyes head and tusks of the animal as a proud elephant strikes at the river bank the sin is striking at sugriva to destroy him the rupaka here is perfect and total
o distinguished rama this anxiety is unbearable for me my good behaviour is relegated to the back of my heart unable to bear the sin just like the dirt surfaces pushing the bright colour of gold when burnt in fire
o rama this race of mighty monkey chiefs is as though reduced to a halfdead state because of my action and the grief of angada
one can find easily a son who is controllable and accessible in need but it is difficult to find a good son like angada who is virtuous and mighty and who is respectful to parents o warrior rama there is no place where i can get a brother like vali a brother cannot be made his relationship is natural rama stresses the same subhashita in yuddhakanda when lakshmana swooned
i am a sinner i desire to enter the blazing fire for atonement in order to maintain friendship with my brother and son at your command these vanara leaders will go round and search for sita
o prince rama even if i am dead the entire task of yours will be accomplished by the vanara race i have ruined the whole race i am sinful and not fit to live permit me to enter fire
rama the hero of the raghu dynasty a destroyer of the enemy heroes was moved to tears he lost composure for a moment when he heard sugrivas lament
in that moment ramathe protector of the world tolerant like the earth beheld tara plunged in grief looking at him again and again and weeping
the foremost ministers of vali lifted up the beautifuleyed noble tara wife of the monkey hero clinging to the body of her husband a lion among monkeys
while tara was clinging to her husband and struggling and was being removed from there she saw effulgent rama holding bow and arrows glittering like the sun
the fawneyed tara saw the magnificent man of kakutstha family endowed with all royal marks and beautiful eyes whom she had never seen before and knew he was rama
the noble tara desperate agonised totally shaken up quickly went near the magnanimous rama who was like indraunapproachable
wise tara baffled out of grief and agitated with pure consciousness approached rama eminent in warfare who could hit the target and spoke
you are immeasurable unassailable self controlled and best among the righteous your fame never diminishes you have great sense of discrimination you are known to possess forbearance like the mother earth your eyes are redcornered which is a sign of valour
you are wielding bow and arrows you possess mighty human limbs that have the power to destroy the enemy you have assumed a divine human body
o warrior kill me by the same single arrow with which you killed my beloved lordvali i will join him after death as he will not be happy without me
if vali with eyes of clear petals of a lotus does not see me in heaven he may not join the wonderfully dressed apsarasas adorned with different kinds of red flowers in their hair
o rama vali will experience sorrow and become pale bereft of me even in heaven just as you are filled with sorrow even on a delightful mountain slope bereft of princess of videha
you are aware of the grief of a young man separated from his wife kill me so that i can go to vali let not vali experience the sorrow of not seeing me
o prince as you are great you might think of the blemish of killing a woman since tara is valis soul you may kill me it will not amount to killing a womanyou will only be killing the soul of vali by killing tara
the sacred texts as well as vedic statements declare that wife is an inseparable part of the husbands soul to the learned there is no greater offering in the world than restoring the wife to her husband you will not beget any sin by killing me
o gallant prince if you give me away to my dear lord carefully considering dharma you will not be committing any adharma by killing me since it will be an offering
o king it is proper on your part to kill me as i am in great distress i am a helpless orphan torn away from her husbando king i will not live long without the wise leader of monkeys who walked majestically like an elephant and wore the choicest golden necklace implored by tara this way the great soul rama lord of the earth said to tara these words of consolation
o wife of a valiant warrior do not lose heart the entire world is controlled by the creator people maintain that joy and sorrow are foreordained
consoled by the influential rama scorcher of enemies tara the charming wife of a warrior stopped wailing aloud     thus ends the twentyfourth sarga in kishkindakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
rama and lakshmana were equally sad rama scion of the kakutstha race consoled sugriva tara as well as angada in the following words
no lamentation revives the dead so you should take up whatever is required now
you have to go the worldly way you have shed tears enough time is passing you cannot perform the funeral after the lapse of appropriate time
fate is the cause of the world fate is the means of accomplishment fate assigns duties to all beings
no one can control anothers action no one including god can be the agent of action no one has the power to entrust duty to others this entire world is governed by ones own nature nature in turn is governed by time fate
god though independent does not deviate from time time cannot be escaped or trangressed it cannot be condoned or avoided no one can transgress their own nature
time has no consideration for relationship friendship or kinship or valour time itself is the cause it is never under ones control
however a wise man should visualise the turn of events in course of time with the right vision dharma artha and kama are controlled by an order laid down by time
vali king of monkeys is dead and gone he acted according to his own nature and attained the sacred fruit of his action comensurate with dharma wealth and pleasures in this world
great vali has earned a place in heaven by virtue of his own dharma and not caring for his own life he has got the heavenly position he earned
the state attained by the chief of monkeys is an excellent onetherefore there is no need to regret attend to your duties relating to rites
seeing sugriva had lost his senses lakshmana the slayer of enemy warriors humbly said at the end of ramas address
o sugriva perform with tara and angada the funeral obsequies relating to the cremation of vali
let the best of dry logs and sandalwood be ordered for the funeral rites of vali
pacify the despondent angada so that he does not entertain childish thoughts any more this city is under your control now
let angada for his part collect garlands of many kinds clothes clarified butter oil fragrants and all that is required to be procured
o tara quickly get a swiftmoving litter fastened with ropes specially suitable for this occasion
let those who are strong and capable among the monkeys be ready to carry the dead body of vali on a litter
having thus spoken to sugriva lakshmana son of sumitra slayer of enemies stood by his brother
on hearing lakshmana tara in an excited state quickly entered the cave city to get the litter
tara jumped in on to the litter carried by strong monkeys
a swiftmoving marvellous palanquin designed by viswakarma was brought covered with colourful pictures of birds and trees on every side it looking like an aerial chariot fit for saints fitted with a splendid seat grilled windows artificially made small caverns and grottos of wood was embellished with carvings of mountains choice ornaments and garlands with red sandal paste red scented flowers and red lotus garlands it resembled the rising sun
seeing the palanquin rama said to lakshmana let the body of vali be placed in the palanquin quickly and last rites duly performed
then sugriva along with angada crying aloud bitterly lifted the body of vali and placed it on the palanquin
valis deadbody was placed on the palanquin decorated with many ornaments garlands and clothes
king sugriva lord of the monkeys said let the funeral rites of my noble sire be performed in a fitting manner
let the monkeys march in front showering many different gems in large quantities and let the palanquin follow
let the monkeys perform the funeral rites of our lord in an honourable way as expensively as has been done with regard to the obsequies of kings who ruled over this land
tara angada and the other bereaved monkeys hastened to perform the funeral ceremony of valiweeping
then all the female monkeys who were in his valis harem walked past the deadbody of vali crying again and again alas oh hero
tara along with other female monkeys followed their lord crying pathetically
when the female monkeys were weeping in the midst of the forest it looked as if the forest and the hills were also mourning
tormented with tears the monkeys prepared in a solitary place surrounded by waters a pyre on the sandbank of a mountain stream
putting down the palanquin from their shoulders on the lonely spot the bearers stood in tearswaiting
seeing her husband lying in the palanquin tara full of grief placed valis head on her lap and cried
why dont you look at me oppressed with tears o monkey king o my venerable lord o longarmed one o my dear
o revered self even though you are bereft of life your face looks cheerful it carries the colour of the setting sun and looks the same when you were alive
o monkey a single arrow from rama who appeared in the forest in the form of death dragged you away from us and turned us all into widows
o king of kings why dont you understand that these female monkeys your wives who were dear to you have come on foot this long distance with great difficulty
o lord of monkeys these moonfaced wives were indeed once your favourites why dont you look at them why dont you look sugriva
o king o sinless hero tara and others your ministers as well as the inhabitants of the capital are here sitting around you
o conqueror of enemies give these monkeys their due in accordance with their status and send them back as you used to do when they were passionately sporting in your company here in this forest
the griefstricken female monkeys helped tara overwhelmed with sorrow due to her husbands death rise from the ground
then angada helped by sugriva placed his fathers body on the pyre with his senses numbed in deep sorrow
overwhelmed with sorrow he offered fire to the father who had set out on a long journey to heaven as per tradition he went round the pyre anteclock wise
the monkeys set valis body to be consumed by fire as per tradition and proceeded to an auspicious river of pure water in order to offer oblation to the departed soul
then the monkeys along with sugriva and tara positioning angada in the forefront made waterofferings to vali collectively
mighty rama who was equally sorrowful and pitiable as sugriva directed the performance of funeral rites
then the chiefs of the army of the monkeys surrounded sugriva who was overcome with grief and was still in wet clothes since he had taken bath at the conclusion of the funeral rites and waited
just like sages stand before the creator brahma all the monkeys stood with folded hands before the longarmed rama the remover of sorrow
hanuman son of the windgod glowing like a golden mountain whose face resembled the rising sun addressed rama with folded hands
o lord by your grace sugriva inherited the ancestral kingdom which would have been otherwise difficult
permitted by your gracious self he will enter the auspicious city along with his friends and perform his duties he had his auspicious bath in fragrant waters with medicinal herbs as per tradition
he wants to propitiate you first specially with garlands and gems pray enter this beautiful mountain cave for the pleasure of the monkeys and establish relationship with king sugriva
requested by hanuman who was skilful in conversation wise rama slayer of enemies replied
dear hanuman in obedience to my fathers command i should not enter any village or city for fourteen years
let sugriva enter the beautiful prosperous cavern kishkinda and be installed by you as king with due rituals
having thus spoken to hanuman rama who knew etiquette addressed mighty sugriva endowed with wisdom
o hero consecrate angada as heirapparent since he deserves it as the eldest son of your brother a noble soul and equal to you in prowess
o noble sugriva the four months from now will be rainy season this is sravana the first month of the season in which rain is expected to start pouring
o goodnatured sugriva this is not a suitable time for any endeavour go to the auspicious capital city of kishkinda and i will reside on the mountain with lakshmana
dear sugriva this cavern of the mountain is large and airy it has abundant water resources with lotuses and lilies
enter the city and get yourself installed and cheer your friends make all arrangement for killing ravana when the month of kartika begins as it is the proper time for the purpose
thus permitted by rama sugriva lord of the monkeys entered the beautiful city of kishkinda once ruled by vali
thousands of monkeys entered the city of kishkinda along with their king and stood in attendance everywhere
then all the subjects of the city collected together prostrated to the chief of the monkey clan with their forehead touching the ground as a mark of respect and sat down
asking the monkeys to rise to their feet the mighty and powerful sugriva entered the inner chambers of his brother
with sugrivathe lord of the monkeys returned to kishkinda his kith and kin coronated him just as the gods consecrated the thousandeyed indra
the monkeys brought a white canopy decorated with gold and two chamaras with glorious golden staff they also brought jewels all kinds of medicinal herbs sprouts sap from trees white flowers and white clothes unguents garlands of fragrant lotuses that grow on land and water heavently sandal fragrants of different kinds goldcoloured paddy honey of priyanga curds tiger skin and sandals made of boar skin then sixteen beautiful cheerful females appeared with unguent gorochana mixed with red arsenic used for putting tilaka on the forehead
then they duly propitiated the brahmins offering them gifts of gems clothes and eatables
then the priests people who recite vedic hymns strew around kusa grass kindled sacred fire with recitation of mantras and made offerings of havis into the fire
then sugriva was seated facing the east on a golden throne with fine coverings on top of the mansion decorated with multicoloured garlands as per tradition sacred waters collected from rivers and rivulets and stored in golden pots was aportioned in accordance with the procedure ordained by the sages in sastras at the appropriate time the pure and fragrant water was poured by gaja gavaya sarabha mainda dvivida hanumanta jambavan and nala on sugriva the bull among monkeys through horns of bulls and jars of gold like the eight vasus bathed the thousandeyed indra thus they performed the consecration
as sugriva was ceremoniously consecrated thousands of monkeys rejoiced and shrieked out of joy
in obedience to ramas instruction sugriva lord of the monkeys installed angada as prince regent and embraced him
the great monkeys concerned hailed sugrivas action saying well done well done on the installation of angada
as sugriva and angada were installed all the monkeys were highly pleased and praised the noblehearted rama and lakshmana again and again
the beautiful city of kishkinda situated in a mountaincave decorated with banners and flags was filled with happy wellfed citizens
after the consecration sugriva entered the cavecity of kishkinda and rama accompanied by his brother reached mountain prasravana
the prasravana mountain reverberated with the terrific roars of tigers and deer and lions there were several kinds of shrubs creepers and treesit was inhabited by bears apes monkeys and wild cats in large number the mountain was like a huge cluster of clouds the waters in the ponds were pure
rama and lakshmana decided to reside in the long wide cave on top of the great mountain
sinless rama the delight of the raghus made an agreement with sugriva and then spoke appropriately to lakshmana his obedient brother and enhancer of glory
o saumitri subduer of enemies this beautiful mountain cave is spacious and adequately ventilated we will reside here in the rainy season
o prince this lovely mountain peak is lofty it has white black and red stones with many kinds of minerals scattered all over it is delightful with caves and streams and various clusters of trees and variegated vines the chirps of several kinds of birds as well as the sounds of excellent peacocks are heard here this place is delightful with bushes of jasmine kunda and sindhuvara sireeshaka kadamba arjuna and sarja in bloom
o prince this lovely mountain peak is lofty it has white black and red stones with many kinds of minerals scattered all over it is delightful with caves and streams and various clusters of trees and variegated vines the chirps of several kinds of birds as well as the sounds of excellent peacocks are heard here this place is delightful with bushes of jasmine kunda and sindhuvara sireeshaka kadamba arjuna and sarja in bloom
o prince this pond with lotus creeper and lotuses in full bloom is endearing it is located not far from the cave
o goodnatured lakshmana the descending path on the northeastern side of the cave and elevation on the the west is auspiciousthis place is protected from rain water and from strong wind
o lakshmana at the entrance of the cave is a rock smooth and large resembling a heap of shining collyrium
o dear look at the mountain peak in the north rising like a raincloudit is auspicious it resembles a heap of collyrium
in the southern direction is a white rock appearing as if it is another mountain it looks like mount kailas and is rich with various minerals
look at the river flowing towards the east it has clean water and flows towards the east of the cave and looks like the river jahnavi flowing on the mount trikuta this place looks delightful with the sandalwood tilaka sala tamala atimukta padmaka sarala and asoka trees
see the different kinds of trees like canes timida vakula ketaka hintala tinisa kadamba dhava krutamalaka betasa grown here and there on the bank of the river which looks beautiful like a woman decorated with clothes and ornaments
the river flocked with hundreds of birds chirping melodious notes and specially the chakravaka birds which are clinging to their mates in great love are moving in pairsthe river has lovely sandy banks filled with swans and sarasa birds the river appears as though a young woman decked all over is laughing
the river looks wonderful with lotuses now blue now red and now white
this placid river water is haunted by waterbirds peacocks and kraunchas it is inhabited by groups of sages
see the uniform rows of sandalwood trees it looks as though they are arranged together imaginatively
o saumitri destroyer of enemies this place is most enchanting surely we will reside here sporting in joy
o prince sugrivas delightful city of kishkinda with wonderful forest around is not far from here
o hero among the victorious the sounds of vocal and instrumental music the beating of drums and shrieking of monkeys are heard from here
having obtained his wife his kingdom and attained prosperity the monkey chief sugriva will be surely enjoying the company of friends and relatives
having said so rama resided with lakshmana on the prasvarana mountain with many beautiful caverns and shrubs of vines
though rama was residing in comfort on the mountain richly endowed with many pleasant things he experienced little happiness
specially with the rising moon in the east he remembered his abuducted wife who was dearer to him than his life
as rama lay in bed at night his grief rose and choked him with tears
seeing rama worried and engrossed in endless sorrow his brother lakshmana who was equally sad spoke these words of consolation
o heroic one you know one who broods fails to achieve his objective so do not brood
o rama you are a man of action enterprising you are godfearing righteous and religious you will not be able to kill a crooked enemy in a battle especially a demon with your valour if you make no endeavour
root out sorrow be daring be firm in resolve only then can you destroy the demon and his family
o kakutstha you can turn the earth with its oceans forests and mountains what to speak of ravana
this is the rainy seasonwait for autumnthereafter you will destroy ravana along with his kingdom and clan
i am only awakening your dormant valour as one would kindle the fire covered with ashes by making offerings
on hearing the good counsel and auspicious words of lakshmana rama spoke these loving and warm words
o lakshmana you have spoken the words of an affectionate and friendly counsellor of proven valour
this sorrow which dampens ones daring spirit is given up i shall now resort to such undaunted valour during my heroic exploits
i will wait for autumn i will stick to your advice while i wait until sugriva and the rivers are pleased with moderate flow of water
then lakshmana reflected upon the words of rama thoughtfully he honoured his brothers words by receiving his advice with folded hands and spoke to his handsome brother giving out his own views
o lord of men your desire will be fulfilled soon be determined to fight the enemy while waiting for autumn forgive this rainy season and its water that obstructs
control your anger and wait for autumn pardon these intervening four months which put a halt on your wareffort stay with me on this mountain infested with lions brace up to kill the enemy     thus ends the twentyseventh sarga of kishkindakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
after the killing of vali and installation of sugriva as king rama arrived at mountain malyavan to residehe said to lakshmana
now that the rainy season has started see the sky covered with mountainlike huge clouds
the sky has drained the water from the oceans through the suns rays and has borne it for nine months from kartika to asarha in its womb it delivers water which is the base for all juices
it is possible to climb up to the sky on the stairs formed by the clouds and decorate the sungod with garlands made of kutaja and arjuna flowers
the sky looks as though its wounds are dressed with pale white moistureladen bandage cloths of clouds red in the border tinged as they are with the glow of twilight
the sky with its gentle winds as its sighs its ash coloured clouds suggestive of a pale face painted with red sandalpaste in the form of glow of twilight appears like a passionate lover
this earth scorched by the heat and then flooded with fresh rain water radiating heat appears like my sita shedding tears burning with grief
the winds released from the wombs of clouds cool as the delicate touch of white lotusescharged with the fragrance of ketaka flowers can be inhaled through the hollow of ones palms
this mountain scented by the fragrance of arjuna and ketaka flowers is bathed in rain water just as sugriva tranquilled by the destruction of the enemy is consecrated in streams of sacred waters
the mountains are covered with dark clouds which appear like the hide of the antelope streams of rain water flowing are like the sacred threads hanging down the shoulder and the sounds of wind filling the caves resemble the recitation of vedas by priests these mountains are comparable to the brahmacharins engaged in the recitation of vedas wearing antelopeskin and sacred threads
the sky lashed with lightnings with whips of gold and emitting groans in the form of peals of thunder appears as though crying in severe pain
the triggering of lightning in the dark clouds appears to me like austere vaidehi struggling helplessly to get free from the lap of ravana
smeared as it were with dense clouds and therefore blocked the directions in which planets including the moon cease to appear are favourable to lovers the moon is said to accenuate the pangs of separation from ones ladylove hence the quarters in which the moon and the stars are hidden by clouds have been favourable to the lovelorn
o saumitri look at the kutaja flowers standing on the mountain slopes withered by the heat they welcome the fresh showers of rain and rekindle passion in me even though my heart is overwhelmed with grief
now the dust has settled and the wind carrying mist is cool the torments of summer have ceased the expeditions of kings have come to a stop and the travellers return to their native land
desirous of living in manasa lake swans have set out on their journey and the chakravaka birds are now united with their mates the carts move not on the roads damaged by heavy rains
the sky which is visible here is not visible there due to clouds scattered it looks bright blue here and dull there it appears like an unruffled ocean interspersed with hills here and there
the mountainstreams of rainwater mingled with sarja and kadamba flowers carry fresh water swiftly to the ocean along with the deposits of red mineral rocks of the mountain hark the peacock cries
the black bees like jambu fruits full of sweet juice people share them to their hearts content while the mango fruits which take multiple colours on getting ripened drop on the ground shaken by the wind
the clouds that resemble high mountain peaks having their banners of lightning with rows of herons as garlands give out loud peals of thunder like elephants in rut trumpet in battlearray
the tender green grass of the forest is shining with rainwater the peacocks are having dance festival and the forests look more enchanting in the afternoon
the huge rumbling clouds on the high mountain peaks carry heavy load of water now they rest and now resume their journey accompanied by herons
the happy rows of herons flying in the sky to meet the clouds appear like a long garland of choice white lotuses strung together hanging in the sky
the earth shines with freshgrown tender grass speckled here and there with small indragopa insects it appears like a woman wearing a parrotgreen veil sprinkled with red lac dye
sleep steals over lord visnu the rivers run swiftly to the sea the female herons fly to catch the clouds joyfully the young bride eagerly approaches her dear lord it is believed that lord visnu goes to sleep during chaturmasya ie from asarh to kartik
peacocks dance in the forest the branches of the kadamba trees get filled with flowers bulls long for union with the cows the earth looks beautiful with green crops and trees
the clouds are raining the rivers are flowing proud elephants are trumpeting those separated from their loved ones are brooding the monkeys are quiet and the peacocks are dancing
the lordly elephants get intoxicated with the fragrance of ketaki flowers the noise of waterfalls and the cackle of peacocks and they give out a shrill trumpet
having sucked honey from the flowercups filled with honey the bees are shedding their drunkenness slowly and hanging on the branches of kadamba trees smitten with showers
the branches of jambu trees profusely filled with fruits appear like piled up balls of charcoal while swarms of bees rest on the branches on the jambu trees
the rainclouds decorated with banners of lightning and giving out peals of thunder shine like elephants in rut trumpeting eager to fight in battle
intoxicated elephants on their march along the mountain in the forest hear the thundering sounds of clouds and suspecting it to be the call of proud elephants to fight turn back
swarms of bees hum here peacocks dance there intoxicated elephants sport in water in other places thus the forest shows its many features
the forest region with its various types of trees like kadamba sarja and arjuna trees and full of fresh water shines like a tavern where girls in the form of peahens dance in excitement
thirsty birds rejoice drinking exceedingly pure water held in leafcups offered by indra in the form of rain which looks like pearls collected in the leafcups as the drops fall on them the hue of their wings seems to change fade
the sweet humming of bees like the music of string instruments vina the croaking of frogs the rumbling of clouds sounding like the beating of drums make it appear as if a musical concert has started in the forest
here the peacocks are dancing and there they are singing elsewhere they are reclining on treetops with their big plumage hanging down it appears as though the peacocks have started a musical concert in the forest
frogs of different forms colours and sounds are croaking awakened from their long sleep by the thunders of clouds and flow of fresh rainwater
washing away their broken banks which obstruct their way to the sea the bloated rivers like proud young ladies with chakravaka birds borne on their surface which look like protruberant breasts rush swiftly to meet their lord the sea chosen for full enjoyment with the gifts of flowers
dark clouds filled with fresh water leaning on dark clouds appear like boulders of rock scorched with wild fire with their bases yet firmly rooted shining
elephants roam the forestland inhabited by peacocks making noise out of joy where the grassy land is filled with crawling indragopa insects and the fragrance of kadamba and arjuna blossoms
the bees have quit the lotus filaments destroyed by the rain and happily move quickly towards fresh filaments of kadamba flowers
intoxicated elephants roam the forest mighty bulls rejoice kings of beasts lions lounge mountains look beautiful kings relax while indra lord of the gods sports with clouds
with their big torrents clouds hanging over the sky drowning the roar of the sea make the rivers ponds lakes and tanks overflow and flood the entire earth
torrents of rain pour at great speed winds roar rivers flow swiftly changing their direction due to breach in the banks
the mountains are consecrated with waterpitchers of clouds brought by the winds offered by lord indra just as kings consecrated by men display their majesty the mountains exhibit their form and glory clouds are compared with water pots
ennveloped by clouds the sun and stars are not visible the earth glides with the flow of fresh waters the directions are not clear covered by darkness
the huge mountain peaks are washed by the heavy downpour of rain which look like long strings of pearls hanging
the waterfalls rushing down the rocks on the huge mountains and flowing through caves and peacocks singing create an image of broken and scattered chains of pearls
the fast flow of waterfalls spread over vast areas completely wash the surroundings of the mountain peaks it appears like chains of pearls collected in the lap of huge caves
the strings of incomparable waterfalls all over the mountain appear as though pearls from the chains of sexually indulgent celestial women are dropping down from heaven broken through physical friction
the time of the setting sun as he remains invisible the whole day is known only by the birds reaching out to their dwellings for rest and by the closing of lotuses and blossoming jasmines
expeditions by kings come to a stop the army returns the flow of water blocks the roads it suspends enmity between states
the month of bhadrapada meant for the recitation of the vedas by brahmins and for those desirous of singing sama veda has started
surely bharata king of kosala would have completed the collection of all his requirement before the commencement of the month of asarh
just as the cheerful voices of people of ayodhya rise as soon as they see me returning certainly the speed of river sarayu is rising filled with rain water
having defeated his enemy sugriva with his wife during the rainy season is wellestablished in the kingdom abounding in merits
o lakshmana i have lost my wife i have been dethroned from the mighty kingdom i am sinking like a river bank overflowed
my sorrow which increases the rains which make it hard to cover distances and ravana the great enemyall these appear difficult to conquer
since sugriva has gone through great difficulties and is reunited with his wives after a long time and since our task is great i did not desire to speak to him now
o lakshmana of auspicious qualities i will wait for the proper time to appease sugriva as well as the rivers
a hero should in return help whoever has helped him an ungrateful person hurts the heart of the virtuous by not returning the assistance
having heard this lakshmana expressed his considered opinion with due respect to handsome rama
o rama come autumn sugriva will soon do all that you desire bear with the rains stay steadfast in your determination to destroy the enemy     thus ends the twentyeighth sarga of kishkindakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
hanuman son of the windgod saw the clear sky flooded with lovely moonlight free from clouds and lightning and cackling of herons he noticed that because sugriva had attained abundant wealth and merit he was not taking care of the kingdom he was engrossed in sensual pleasures having accomplished the desired object he was engaged in enjoyment of the company of women his own wives and tara whom he coveted he was strolling in the pleasant garden night and day without caring for the kingdom entrusting it to the ministers whose movements he did not watch he was sporting with women like indra sports with apsaras in the nandana gardenhanuman who was conscious of his duties and responsibilities who was aware of the importance of action in time and who was skilful in speech approached sugriva king of the monkeys having decided to take him into confidence hanuman spoke in a convincing wellmeaning sweet pleasing manner words truthful and helpful conciliatory and just full of love and affection

you have attained the kingdom you have earned fame the prosperity of your family has gone up all that remains is to earn the goodwill of friends attend to that now
the kingdom glory and fame of a king who knows the value of time and conducts himself well towards his allies always grows
he to whom the treasury sceptre allies and his own self all these are equally dear enjoys a large kingdom
endowed with right conduct you ought to duly answer the cause of your ally conforming to proper course of action
whoever sets aside his personal interest and works for the welfare of his ally with due enthusiasm and excitement will not be harmed
he who exceeds the time limit in accomplishing a friends task and puts forth great effort later succeeds not
o subduer of enemies we should do the brave deed of finding vaidehi for the sake of your friend o crusher of enemies this is your duty at present and it is already delayed
o king a wise man like rama who is aware of timely action would not tell you even if it is unduly delayed even when he is in a hurry to get the work done since he is staying in your kingdom since he is dependant on you
rama is responsible in lending stability to you and to your wellknown family he will continue to be your ally for a long time let it be known that his power is boundless and his virtues peerless
o king pray accomplish his object the same way he has accomplished your own you ought to issue orders to the foremost of the monkeys
time will not be deemed lapsed in vain if the work is sincerely taken up without delay and without pressure from your ally rama if it is undertaken under pressure it will be considered transgression of time
o lord of monkeys help even a person who has not helped you as such do you need to be told that you should help one with whose help you have earned wealth and kingdom
o protector of the monkeys you are powerful and you are prompt why dont you issue orders which will please rama
indeed rama is fully capable of subduing gods demons as well as nagas with his arrows he is looking for your help in view of your promise
he has done you a deed dear to you without hesitation risking his own lifelet us help him in search of his vaidehi whether she is on earth or in heaven
not gods demons gandharvas or even marutas suras or yakshas can cause fright in him much less the rakshasas
therefore o king of monkeys you ought to oblige rama wholeheartedly exerting all your strength as he has done your work
o lord of monkeys commanded by you each one of us or all of us together can ransack the underworld the earth or water or heaven
o sinless hero therefore issue your command there are more than a crore of invincible monkeys determine now who should do and what and in which place we are at your service
sugriva who had a great sense of duty started applying his mind when he heard the honest advice of hanuman
he sent word to the ever diligent nila his favourite to collect all cadres of army of the monkeys from all directions
let the entire army with leaders of different groups assemble here seperately o chief of army act accordingly
let the swiftfooted monkeys guardians of frontiers army chiefs muster soon in obedience to my command you nila alone should personally supervise the work to be done next
in strict obedience to my orders go with angada to the elderly monkeys and inform them about my decision and order after making this arrangement valiant sugriva entered his residence     thus ends the twentyninth sarga of kishkindakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
while sugriva was in his residence rama was in prasravana mountain spending his rainy nights tormented by passion for sita sugriva was engaged in love forgetting the time fixed for taking up the search for sita when the sky became clear of clouds after the rainy season rama sat gazing at the clear autumnal moons orb he was besmeared with moonlight and felt perturbed as time was running out and then fell into a swoon only a few months remained for the completion of the exile and bharata will put an end to himself if rama does not return to ayodhya on the stipulated day this worried rama
gaining back the senses after a while wise rama started thinking about vaidehi who remained in his heart
sitting on top of the mountain shining with gold and minerals rama gazed at the pleasant autumnal sky and started thinking of his beloved
looking at the sky rid of clouds and lightning filled with the sounds of flocks of sarasa birds rama cried in a pitiable state
how will the young lady sita whose voice is like the sarasa birds who was revelling listening to its sweet cackle at the hermitage be living now
how will my beloved wife feel on seeing the asana flowers which are as pure as gold when she does not find me anywhere
how will my sita with her charming limbs and sweet words who used to get up from sleep by the cackle of swans wake up now
how will that lady with large pale white eyes sustain her life now since she is used to listening to the sweet notes of chakravaka birds who were her companions
even though i am wandering by lakes rivers wells forests and grovesi am not happy without that fawneyed lady
i think even the charm of autumn must be always tormenting that lovely lady as she is very far from me she is too delicate to suffer the agony of separation
thus the best among the princes wailed just as chakrabaka laments for water from indra lord of the gods
graceful lakshmana returned after going round and round the beautiful mountain slopes for fruits and saw his brother
observing rama who had lost his senses lying alone in unbearable agony venerable lakshmana became sad and miserable and spoke to his brother
o revered brother why do you succumb to passion and loss of selfconfidence why is the usual composure of your mind withdrawn why do you desist from yaga
you are an undaunted warrior take to the path of action resort to samadhiyoga or meditation and regain the serenity of mind make the strength of your effort the source of your success
o lord of the human race o worthy hero when you are the protector janaki cannot be retained by any one easily just as burning fire after it reaches its full height cannot be retained by any one
rama said to lakshmana an unassailable warrior with auspicious signs that what he had spoken was natural beneficial wise and usefulit is in accordance with sama veda and the science of statecraft well established in dharma and artha
my dear there is no doubt that i have to consider the work ahead give special attention to follow up surely i need to think over this herculian task and its achievement
then falling back on the memory of maithili the lady with eyes like lotus petals he said to lakshmana with parched lips
having satisfied the earth with abundant rain water and having fulfilled the task of ripening the crops the thousandeyed indra has done his duty has settled down now
o prince having discharged their water the clouds after the rains are exhausted they are moving now over trees and mountains making deep and pleasant sounds
the clouds which were dark till now like the blue lotus petals darkening all the ten directions are like elephants free from all intoxication as their fury is abated
o dear the moist winds have ceased to blow as before and are carrying the fragrance of kutaja and arjuna flowers
o sinless lakshmana the rumblings of heavy clouds the trumpeting of elephants the cry of peacocks and the sound of waterfalls have become suddenly stilled
the mountain slopes having been washed by the showers of rain on all sides are cleansed they are shining in variegated colours and look as though the mountain peaks are smeared with glowing colours of minerals
the autumn has set in manifesting its grace on the branches of saptachada treessevenleafed banana plant through the radiance of stars sun and moon and through the sports of excellent elephants
from the beauty of autumn manifested in a variety of ways on the clusters of lotuses touched by the sun it seems the goddess of wealth shines and shines effulgently the lotus is goddess laxmis favourite flower
the wind carries the fragrance of saptachada flowers attracted by the fragrance swarms of bees come humming the pride of the elephants in rut increases
the swans have come face to face with chakravaka birds they have newly arrived lovers of lakes they are shaking the pollen of lotuses on their lovely wide wings and have settled on the sandy bankssporting
goddess laxmi with her scattered self shines there among the proud elephants among herds of excited bulls and among streams with clear water
the sky is free from clouds the peacocks have shed their ornamental plumes they have lost interest in their beloveds with their glory withdrawn the peacocks are devoid of happiness and absorbed in the thought of the clouds
the forests are delightful to the eyes as if illuminated by a large number of goldencoloured finesmelling priyaka branches bent under the heavy loads of flowers
lordly elephants accompanied by their dear female mates fond of lotus ponds and woods are out to enjoy the sweet smell of the blossoms of saptachada and excited by passion and longing for sexual union are moving slowly
cleared of the black clouds the sky is shining like a polished weapon the river waters flow feebly winds blowing over white lotuses feel cool all quarters clear of darkness are shining
the bulls surrounded by cows are bellowing with the dust settled on their limbs excited by passion they are happy ready to fight they look attractive blessed by the attributes of autumn
the female elephants of good breed deeply passionate gather round and follow their intoxicated lord moving slowly through the forest
the peacocks have shed their ornamental wear their plumes they are moving on the river banks miserably devoid of high spirit as if they are being taunted by flocks of sarasa birds who are highspinted and cheerful
excellent elephants in rut with ichor exuding from their temples trumpet frightening the ducks and chakravaka birds in the water strirring the water in the lakes ornamented with lotuses they drink it
the swans are full of joy flocking on the sand banks of rivers crowded with cows where the water is pure and devoid of mud the rivers are full of sarasa birds and swans who are singing delightfully
suddenly the turbulent sounds of the river waters waterfalls and thunderclouds have stopped the peacoks having lost the pleasure of blowing winds lost their excitement the croaking of frogs is silent
with no new rainclouds in the sky venomous multicoloured serpents crawl out of the anthills with emacited hybernated bodies troubled by hunger due to long confinement
while the stars appear with the soothing touch of the moons beams this ruddy twilight is quitting the sky on her own
the night appears like a lady with a sweet face lit up by the rising moon her beautiful eyes opened up by stars her body draped in the robe of white moon light
driven by the wind the lovely sarasa birds after eating ripened grains from paddy fields happily fly the sky in rows like a garland at great speed
with a single swan in sleep night lotuses blooming around it the water in the big tank appear like the sky free from clouds with the full moon and clusters of stars scattered the swan is the moon the lotuses the stars and the clean pond the sky
lakshmi the goddess of wealth also of autumn appears decorated with deep wells like an excellent lady with swans as girdles and blooming lotuses and lilies as garlands
the whistling of bamboos enhanced by the wind in the early morning and the bellowing of bulls echoing in the caves supplement each other as it were
the river banks shining with fresh white flowers of kasa reeds swayed by the gentle breeze silken look like a lady wrapped in white silk
the butterflies glitter around in the forest fearlessly showing their skill in drinking honey with their backs turned white with the dust of pollen grains from the lotus cups they follow the wind along with their loved ones in the forest
the fresh blooms of night lotuses the cackle of krauncha birds fully ripened fields of paddy the gentle breeze and the bright moon indicate the coming to an end of the rainy season and setting in of autum
now the riverbrides displaying their girdles of fish have slowed down like the gait of sensuous ladies in the early morning exhausted by sexual pleasures
crowded with chakravaka birds and green moss and covered with kasa reeds like silken veils the river banks appear like the face of the bride decorated with designs of green leaves and gorochana tilaka
now cupid is moving unobstructed showing his power by holding his bow indicating strict punishment to those separated from their beloveds in the forests with bana and asana flowers in bloom and bees humming happily
having showered heavy rains and filling tanks and rivers and producing bumper crops on the earth the clouds have disapeared
just as bashful young brides show their loins slowly during their first sexual meet the rivers start showing their sandy banks slowly in autumn
o gentle lakshmana the pure water in the tanks and sweet sounds of flocks of female kurari birds and chakravakas there are splendid
the asanas saptaparna kovida and bandhujeeva trees and shyama creepers are seen in full bloom on the mountain slopes
lakshmana look at the swans sarasas chakravakas and kurara birds scattered all over the river banks
o handsome prince the time has come for making expeditions by kings against the enemies waiting for victory
o prince this is time for the first expedition of the year by kings i do not find sugriva making effort in that direction
o gentle one the four months of rainy season are spent without seeing sita it is equal to a hundred years for my griefstricken heart
just as a female chakravaka follows the male sita followed her husband into this dense dandaka forest as though it is a pleasuregarden
o lakshmana king sugriva shows no mercy on one who is griefstricken separated from his wife and banished from the kingdom
o gentle one although i am a vanquisher of foes this evilminded king of monkeys is slighting me because i am away from home i have lost my kingdom i am outraged by ravana i am miserable and lovesick and i have sought his help
the evilminded sugriva having fulfilled his objective does not realise that he has made a promise to me and has reached the time set for the search of sita
go to kishkinda and speak on my behalf to that fool sugriva the chief of monkeys who is revelling in habitual sensual pleasures
he who having promised to his friend to grant his desire and who having been obliged fails to implement the promise is the lowest on earth
on the other hand he who honours his promise whether good or bad is truly heroic the best of men
even the carnivorous animals dislike to eat the body of such ungrateful men who do not help their friends even though they have received help and have achieved their objective
surely he wishes to see the form of my bow inlaid with gold bent by me to its full length looking like a streak of lightning
perhaps he wants once again to hear when enraged in a combat the dreadful twang of my bow resembling the peal of a thunderbolt
o prince knowing my valour fully weli and knowing that you are here to help me he is unhesitatingly revelling in sensual pleasures
o conqueror of the enemy capital the monkey lord who has achieved his goal does not realise the importance of my mission
having promised to search for sita after the rainy seasonsugriva is not aware that he has already spent the four monthsrevelling
sporting with the council of ministers surrounding him resorting to drinking he shows no compassion to us feeling wretched with grief
o mighty warrior o dear go to sugriva and make him aware of the virulence of my anger and tell him
the route by which vali departed killed by me has not been closed o sugriva you ought to abide by the pledge given do not follow the path of vali
vali was killed by me in the battle with a single arrow while i shall kill you now along with your near and dear ones since you have deviated from the truth
o bull among men o hero speak to him that all that is done in time is done well hurry up ask him to do whatever is good for him as well as for us
o lord of monkeys carry out the promise you made to me consider it to be eternal dharma slain by my arrows you will see vali in the abode of the lord of death
on seeing rama the protector of the human race wailing lakshmana of terrific lustre hardened his stand against sugriva and proceeded charged with intense anger     thus ends the thirtieth sarga of kishkindakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
seeing the indomitable hero his elder brother son of a king lovesick dejected and overcome by anger and grief spoke prince lakshmana
sugriva has not stuck to the conduct of the virtuous of sharing the fruits of action equally he does not realize that he obtained the prosperous kingship of vanaras as a result of your friendly action he does not have the intelligence of conducting himself in your favour of searching sita therefore he will not enjoy the kingship for long
o hero he is too ungrateful to return the favour done to him engaged in rustic vulgar pleasures he is not thinking of it let him see his killed elder brother kingship should not be given to an individual who is a destitute of virtues
i cannot hold my overflowing anger i shall kill this untruthful sugriva let valis son along with the foremost of monkeys search for the queen sita
rama a slayer of enemy heroes but not of those who seek his refuge spoke in a conciliatory tone to lakshmana who jumped wielding bow and arrows inspired with his fierce fighting spirit
o lakshmana with your good conduct you should not do so keeping in view the affectionate friendship extended by sugriva earlier be friendly
sugriva has exceeded the time limit avoiding harsh words you ought to speak to him in a conciliatory manner
having been duly briefed by his elder brother the heroic lakshmana destroyer of enemies a bull among men entered the city
the noblehearted benevolent and wise lakshmana eager to please rama picked up his bow looking like a mountain peak comparable to the bow of indra and agitated with the anger of the god of death entered the mansion of sugriva which stood like the mountain peak of mandara
then lakshmana obedient intelligent like brihaspati like a tempest encompassed by the fire of anger and deliberating in his mind as to the possible questions from sugriva and the reply from him
lakshmana rushed on foot speedily cutting the branches of sala tala and asvakarna and other trees on the way and forcibly turning and crushing the mountain rocks into pieces with a single foot like a swiftmoving elephant taking long strides to carry out the task
the tiger of the ikshvaku race saw the inaccessible kishkinda the capital of vanara kingdom located between mountains and fortified with the army
his lips trembling in anger lakshmana saw fierceful monkey guards of sugriva at the entrance of kishkinda city
hundreds of monkeys of the size of elephants stood holding huge trees and boulders of rocks on seeing lakshmana the bull among men
on seeing the monkeys wielding weapons lakshmanas anger doubled like logs of firewood put to burning
seeing enraged lakshmana who looked like a veritable god of death at the time of dissolution of the universe hundreds of monkeys their limbs trembling in fear ran in different directions
having entered sugrivas palace the monkeychiefs reported the arrival of angry lakshmana
but sugriva who was engrossed in overtures with passionate tara did not heed the words of the monkeychiefs
commanded by the ministers the monkeys who looked like fierce mountains elephants and clouds that caused horripilation left the place at once
the monkeys their faces deformed their nails and teeth like weapons were dreadful and horrifying in appearance proud as tigers
of them some possessed the strength of ten some a hundred and some a thousand elephants all of them were of equal valour
enraged lakshmana saw the huge inacccessible city of kishkinda filled with mighty strong and fierce monkeys holding trees in hand
the mighty monkeys came out of the entrance of the ironboundary wall from beneath and made their appearance and stood in full attention
the sensible warrior recognising sugrivas dereliction of duty and his own brothers agony once again flew into fury
sighing hot deep breath eyes turned red in anger this tiger among men appeared like fire with smoke the sigh was smoke and red eyes fire
his bow was like the hood of a snakewith the iron nails fixed on the tip of his arrows like moving fangs and his own brightness like the venom of the fivehooded snake
dismayed angada approached lakshmana who was glowing like fire at the time of dissolution of the world and enraged like the lord of serpents
renowned lakshmana with his eyes turned red in anger said to angada o dear inform sugriva about my arrival
o subduer of enemies speak in this way lakshmana the dear younger brother of rama has come to you and waits for your presence at the entrance burning in grief of his elder brother well if you like to hear his words do as you please return swiftly after saying so
on hearing lakshmanas words angada became sad he approached his father sugriva and said saumitri has come this sloka appears an interpolation
on hearing lakshmanas words powerful angada felt agitated his face turned pale he went and prostrated at once to the king and then to the queen ruma
highly brilliant angada holding his fathers feet first then mothers and thereafter rumas reported the matter to sugriva
the monkey was too drowsy with drink too intoxicated with passion to come back to his senses
looking at angry lakshmana and scared at heart the monkeys started making a noise in order to please him
they saw lakshmana advancing like a mighty flood and went near him making sounds like the thunderbolt or a lion
by the great sound of the monkeys the drunken redeyed vanara king awakened his garlands and ornaments in disarray
on hearing angadas words the two ministers named plaksha and prabhava who were perrmitted to have audience with the queens went to the harem on invitation from angada they reported to sugriva about the arrival of lakshmana who had come to speak to him about matters regading wealth and righteousness
both of them sat close by sugriva who was like indra and said these pleasing words
rama and lakshmana both the brothers venerable and true to their promise have conferred on you sovereignty and have extended friendship
of the two only lakshmana is standing at the entrance wielding his bow in hand the monkeys are trembling in fear and running about making a loud noise
by the command of rama his brother has come to you ramas words as charioteer and his work as chariot
o blameless king taras son angada has sent us into your presence lakshmana has come
o lord of monkeys valiant lakshmana is standing at the entranceeyes filled with anger as if he would burn the vanaras
o great king go at once with your son and relations salute him now and avert his anger
o king be true to your promise to his brother righteous rama without fail honour the agreement     thus ends the thirtyfirst sarga of kishkindakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
on hearing about lakshmanas anger from angada prudent sugriva consulted his counsellors
sugriva being skilled in secret assessment of matters considering the merits and demerits spoke to his council of ministers capable of intelligent counselling
indeed i have not uttered any harsh word or done anything wrong i therefore wonder why ramas brother lakshmana is angry with me
some enemies who are always searching for imaginary faults of mine might have poisoned lakshmanas ears
in the meanwhile right now all of you should think quietly and try to know the reason for lakshmanas anger using your intellect and expertise logically and decide the course of action
i have no fear either from lakshmana or from rama however when a friend is enraged without reason it creates misgivings
it is easy to earn a friend but keeping the friendship sustained is difficult due to fickleness of mind friendship gets broken even on flimsy grounds
therefore i am apprehensive of rama i am not able to repay the help he has rendered to me
when sugriva spoke thus hanuman the great monkey submitted in the presnce of the monkeyministers applying his own logic
it is not at all a matter of surprise o king of vanara clan that you forgot the good service rendered to you with utmost sense of friendship
to remove your fear and to please you the great hero rama has killed vali an equal to indra in valour
ramas anger is purely out of love for you he has sent lakshmana a bestower of prosperity to you there is no doubt about it
you knows best the passage of time changing seasons but you are not aware out of inattention that the auspicious autumn has set in making the garden lush green with blossoms of saptachada flowers
the sky from which the dark clouds have completely disappeared is illumined with planets and stars the rivers and tanks as well as all directions are pleasant
o chief of monkeys it is time for military expeditions since you are intoxicated you are not aware of this lakshmana has come here evidently for this
the message sent by a man who is in distress and is deprived of his wife should be accepted even if they are harsh since he is a great self who has rendered you help
in these circumstances the best way is seeking apology from lakshmana with folded hands i do not see any way other than this
the counsellors and ministers appointed by a king should certainly give good advice without fear this i tell you since i have faith in my words
he who deserves propitiation should not be offended more so by a grateful man remembering the help received by him earlier
o king bow down your head along with your son friends and relations and honour the oath just as a wife subordinates to the will of the husband stand by obediently
o king of monkeys it is not right for you to overlook the commands of rama or lakshmana even in mind you know the superhuman virtues of rama particularly his valour the two brothers are like indra and upendra in valour and might     thus ends the thirtysecond sarga in kishkindakanda of the first epic the holy ramayana composed by sage valmiki
instructed by rama and having been permitted lakshmana the slayer of enemies entered the frightful cave of kishkinda
seeing lakshmana the huge and mighty monkey gatekeepers stood at the entrance and greeted him with folded hands
the monkeys kept away out of fear to see the son of dasaratha who was angry and sighing deeply
lakshmana the bestower of fortune saw the mammoth cave inlaid with gems and precious stones and forests full of delightful flowers
the palace was thronged with elevated mansions and illumined with jewels of all kinds the trees were in bloom and the fruits satisfied every ones wishit was splendid
the inhabitants of kishkinda being sons of gods and gandharvas were of beautiful appearance wearing wonderful garlands they could change their form at their free will they were delightful
the royal roads were filled with fragrant unguents like sandal agaru and lotus incenses finesmelling honey of several kinds and happy inhabitants
lakshmana saw tall buildings comparable to vindhya and meru mountains and pure water flowing from the mountain streams
on the royal road lakshmna saw beautiful homes of monkeychiefs angada mainda dwivida gavaya gavaksha gaja sarabha vidyunmalin sampati suryaksha hanuman veerabahu subahu the great nala kumuda and sushena similarly he saw the homes of tara and jambavan dadhivaktra nila supatala and sunetra tara mentioned here is a male monkey
these homes were shining like white clouds with wonderful garlands hung on filled with abundance of wealth grains and best of females
the abode of sugriva was encircled by a white rampart and unapproachableit was enchanting like the abode of indra the mansion tops were like the white peaks of kailas mountain filled with blossoming trees which could yield all kinds of fruits to suit ones taste the trees were huge like dark clouds cool and shady with wonderful flowers in full bloom the riches gifted by indra were delightful the entrance was guarded by mighty monkeys holding weapons in hand it had a golden archway at the entrance decorated with wonderful garlands and strings of golden flowers saumitri of great prowess entered the rich abode of sugriva just as the sun enters huge clouds unobstructed
righteous lakshmana crossed the seven enclosures filled with different kinds of people and saw a great harem full of several bright gold and silver cots excellent seats here and there with best of cushions spread
as he entered he heard melodious sounds of string instruments and music worded to metre with different kinds of tunes
powerful lakshmana saw many females of different forms proud of their youth and charm at the palace of sugriva
lakshmana saw women with a good lineage adorned with colourful flower garlands and choicest ornaments engaged in making garlands and arranging fruits he also saw at sugrivas palace attendants gentle welldressed contented and not too busy
illustrious lakshmana felt abashed on hearing the jingling of girdle bells and tinkling of the womens anklets
on hearing the sounds of ornaments of females heroic lakshmana lost his temper quickly he pulled his bowstring forcefully in wrath producing frightening sound filling all quarters
aware of the anger of rama who likes it not the longarmed lakshmana moved away from the spot abstained from entering private apartments as per tradition receded to a lonely place and stood
then sensing the arrival of lakshmana by the sound of his bow string sugriva the lord of vanaras alighted at once from the throne
truly saumitri the loving brother of rama has arrived as announced by angada earlier
as proclaimed by angada and also from the sound of the twang sugriva knew about the arrival of lakshmana his mouth parched with fear
then sugriva the best of monkeys got agitated at heart out of fear he saw the pleasing tara and said to her these good words clearly
o tara with beautiful eyebrows this younger brother of rama is normally softhearted but today he arrived here angry what could be the reason
o blemishless tara what is the cause of young lakshmanas anger great men do not display anger without reason
if anything displeasing has been done by us you should know and tell me quickly you ought to speak to him at once
o lovely lady or else you should see him personally and propitiate him with your soothing words
lakshmana will be clear of all doubts on seeing you and will not be angry great men are not harsh to women
start talking to him with pleasing words and make him happy then i shall see lakshmana with eyes like lotuspetals a subduer of enemies
tara whose eyes were drowsy with drink whose long gold string of the girdle was hanging loose appeared before lakshmana with faltering steps and bent low bashful of her appearance it suggests a state of exhaustion after sexual pleasures
since prince lakshmana is a great man he stood with his face down and showing no reaction controlled his anger due to the presence of a female standing close by
setting aside her shyness for being in a drunken state and observing lakshmanas favourable disposition she spoke meaningful words in a pleasing manner with friendly eloquence
o noble prince what is the cause of your anger who has disrespected your command who can approach without fear forest fire rushing towards a thicket of dried pieces of wood
having heard taras unhesitant submission spoken in a pleasant and friendly manner lakshmana replied
o lady your husband engrossed in sensual pleasures has lost sight of dharma and artha why dont you understand it in the interest of your husband whose wellwisher you are
o tara that we are in grief sugriva does not realize he is not attending to state affairs he is only enjoying drinking in the company of ministers
the king of monkeys has already spent four months enjoying drinks he does not realize that he has flouted his promise
drinking this way does not help accomplishment of dharma and artha it destroys wealth ambition and righteousness
dharma is violated when we help not one who has helped loss of a virtuous friend leads to great loss of wealth it results in destruction
you have a strong sense of duty you ought to tell him his duty and what we should do in this situation
tara heard the sweet words of lakshmana which showed his good understanding of dharma and artha what she said to him in reply reflects her faith in sugrivas effort to help ramas cause
o prince this is not the time to get angry with your own people he sugriva is your friend and wishes to do your work you should bear with him even if he makes a mistake
o prince how can you richly endowed with virtues be angry with an inferior person how can a person like you preeminent in virtuesand a source of great penance fall a victim to anger
i know about the anger of rama the friend of sugriva i am aware of the time limit set for his work i am aware of our omissions in this regard i also know about the mission
o lakshmana i am aware of the irresistible strength of lust born out of the body i am aware of sugrivas indifference to his duty due to his passion with whomsoever it be
you are under the grip of anger and your mind is not involved in carnal desire one who is engaged in sensual pleasures does not reckon time and place nor does he consider artha and dharma
o slayer of enemy heroes pardon sugriva the lord of vanara clan who is to you a brother he is here indulging in sports of love with me he has no sense of shame about his passion
even sages committed to piety and austerity are sometimes deluded by sensual gratification he is a king and a monkey who is fickle by nature how can he be not tempted by sensual pleasures
overcome by drunkenness tara once again spoke to lakshmana of unfathomable prowess in a meaningful way keeping in view the welfare of her playful and drunken lord
o best of men although overpowered by sense pleasures sugriva has already initiated efforts for the accomplishment of your work
o great warrior monkeys residing at different mountains who can assume any form they like have arrived in hundreds and thousands of crores
o longarmed one come in you have been standing out guarding your character it is not a mistake to see the wife of a pious person with a friendly feeling
strongarmed lakshmana a subduer of enemies permitted by tara entered the harem immediately thinking of the urgency of the task
lakshmana saw famous sugriva difficult to be conquered seated on a golden throne strewn around with cushions decorated with ornaments of different colours endearing in appearance decked with beautiful garlands and clothes he was surrounded by women adorned with most fascinating ornaments and garlands bewildered at the sight lakshmanas eyes turned red in anger he appeared like yama lord of death
on seeing the angry lakshmana a bull among men who could not be obstructed enter in sugriva was disturbed
seeing enraged lakshmana son of dasaratha sighing heavily glowing like bright fire burning with the sorrow of rama sugriva jumped out of his seat quitting the decorated golden throne just as indras decorated banner is raised up suddenly
as soon as sugriva jumped up ruma and other womenfolk rose to their feet like the clusters of stars around the fullmoon in the sky
with eyes red as blood through drunkennessprosperous sugriva was shaken like the kalpa treehe stood there and offered salutationsto lakshmana with folded hands
looking at sugriva surrounded by ruma and other women like the moon among stars infuriated lakshmana said
only a king who is an heir to a noble family compassionate and selfcontrolled grateful and truthful excels in the world
which king can be more malicious than the one who makes false promises and adopts an unrighteous path towards those who helped him
if a man tells a lie about a horse he commits the sin of killing a hundred horses if one tells a lie about a cow he shares the sin of killing a thousand cows if one tells a lie about a man it is equal to the sin of killing oneself and his own people
o lord of monkeys he who having accomplished his task first with the help of his friend does not return the help is ungrateful such a person deserves to be killedit applies to all beings
o lord of the monkeys here is a verse worthy of appreciation by all the worlds sung by a brahmin when he saw an ungrateful person listen
there is expiation for one who kills a brahmin a drunkard a thief and a violator of sacred vows but there is no atonement for an ungrateful man
o monkey you have already achieved your objective with the help of rama but have not helped rama in return you are surely an ignoble and ungrateful liar
o monkey if you are grateful to rama you should wish to search for sita indeed you should make efforts to take it up
you have failed to keep your word you are engaged in worldly pleasures rama did not know that you are a serpent croaking like a frog
rama is illustrious compassionate and great he has granted the kingdom to you to one who is a sinner and an evilminded person
if you do not recognise the help of rama who can accomplish any deed with ease you will be killed with my sharp arrows and meet vali in heaven
o sugriva the path by which vali went is not closedi wish you do not follow him you stand by the promise made
you have not seen the thunderboltlike arrows released from the bow of rama the renowned prince of the ikshvaku race therefore you are resorting to enjoyment without any fear and have not given thought to ramas work     thus ends the thirtyfourth sarga in kishkindakanda of the first epic the holy ramayana composed by sage valmiki
while lakshmana the son of sumitra was glowing like fire with his brilliance thus spoke the moonfaced tara
o lakshmana you in particular should not speak to the king of vanaras in that manner he does not deserve to hear from your mouth words which are harsh
o hero sugriva king of monkeys is not ungrateful or deceitful he is neither crooked nor false
o hero this warrior sugriva has not forgotten the help rendered by rama in combat which was difficult to win
o scorcher of enemies it is by ramas grace that sugriva has attained fame the kingdom of monkeys and ruma and me
sleep did not come to him in deep distress in the past and now that great happiness has come he does not realize that it is time to act search for sita he behaves like sage viswamitra
o lakshmana great sage visvamitra was in union with an apsara gritachi for ten years and felt it was just one day indeed
if the brilliant and the most distinguished of those who knew the value of time did not realise the passing of time what can be said of an ordinary person
o lakshmana you should pardon him since he is not yet satisfied though tired with the struggle for the fulfilment of his sensual pleasures
o dear lakshmana not knowing the true intention of sugriva it is not proper for you to be rashly angry like an ordinary man
o bull among men men with right vision like you do not become angry instantly without right thinking
o lakshmana knower of dharma give up your agitation arising out of great anger be composed for the sake of sugriva
i feel sugriva should is prepared to renounce the monkeykingdom wealth grains and other treasures and even ruma and me for the pleasure of rama
killing ravana in war sugriva will restore sita soon to ramarama will join sita like moon joins rohini
the number of demons in lanka is reported to be a hundred thousand crore three lakh ninetynine thousand and six hundred note indian tradition has numbers up to eighteen digits one hundred thousand crores is equal to a mahapadma which has thirteen digits the number described here is
it is not possible to kill ravana who has stolen sita without killing those unassailable demons who can assume any form at their will
o lakshmana moreover it is not possible for sugriva alone to kill the wicked ravana without the help of the monkeys
vali the wellinformed lord of the monkeys has given an account of the demons the source of the account is not known to metherefore i am speaking from what i have heard
monkey chiefs have been sent to bring multitudes of monkey leaders to help you in the battle
sugriva is awaiting the arrival of the powerful and strong vanaras without whose help he cannot accomplish ramas tasktherefore he has not yet started the search
o lakshmana since sugriva has already promulgated an ordinance to all the mighty vanaras they should be all arriving by now
looking at your angry countenance with bloodred eyes the wives of the foremost of monkeys are frightened by the possibility of similar danger of the past of valis death and do not find peace of mind     thus ends the thirtyfifth sarga in kishkindakanda of the first epic the holy ramayana composed by sage valmiki
thus the gentlenatured saumitri accepted taras courteous words sanctioned by dharma
sugriva king of the vanara clan cast aside his great fear when lakshmana accepted the words of tara just as one discards a wet garment from the body
thereupon sugriva relieved from his drunken state tore off the great colourful valuable garland worn on his neck
sugriva the noblest of all monkeys spoke these polite words in a pleasing manner to lakshmana of terrific strength
o saumitri my prosperity fame and the permanent sovereignty of vanaras had been lost it was regained by the grace of rama
o crusher of enemies how is it possible to repay the famous lord ramas valour in killing vali
righteous rama can merely restore sita with my assistance by his own fiery energy he will kill ravana
rama shattered seven huge trees a mountain and earth with a single arrow what assistance does he need
o lakshmana the twang of his bow shook even the mountains and the earth what assistance does he need
o lakshmana bull among men i shall only join him along with others when he leads the army to kill ravana
if i have committed even a little transgression in my faith in rama or affection for him and exceeded the time limit my mistakes are to be excused as one would pardons a servant no one is flawless in the world
lakshmana who was happy to hear great sugriva replied affectionately
o sugriva king of monkeys when you are extending due courtesy to my brotherhe has a guardian in you by all means
you are powerful and straightforward by natureyou are humble and noble therefore you deserve the high prosperity of the kingdom of the monkeys
o sugriva with you as associate valiant hero rama will kill his enemies in war very soon there is no doubt about it
o sugriva you know dharmayou are grateful and will not turn back from the battle so your words are true and befitting
o best of monkeys barring you and my elder brother who else would be capable of speaking this way about themselves even when you are aware of others faults
you who are equal to rama in valour and strength will continue to be the gift of gods to us for long
nevertheless i want you to proceed from here with me at once and reassure your friend who is agrieved due to the abduction of his wife
thus ends the thirtysix sarga of kishkindakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
having heard the great lakshmana sugriva said to hanuman the minister who stood by his side
send for the monkeys residing at the five mountains of mahendra himavan vindhya kailasa and the whitepeaked mount mandara those monkeys residing on the western mountains on the sea shore and on mount udaya shining like the rising sun monkeys like dark clouds shining in the twilight sun those at the fierce padmatala garden and those at the anjana mountain who resemble dark clouds like collyrium and are as strong as elephants those monkeys of golden complexion residing at the red arsenic mountain caves beside mount meru those on mount meru and dhumra who are of bright red colour like the rising sun drinking liquor maireya the monkeys of terrific speed at mount maharuna those staying at the delightful hermitages in the forests and those living on the ground all must be cajoled and persuaded to report at once

this is in addition to the monkeys for whom swiftfooted messengers have already been sent
get all the monkeys including those engaged in carnal pleasures and those slow in movement all at once on my command
kill those evilminded ones within ten days for disobeying the royal orders
the hundreds of thousands of crores of obedient lionlike monkeys should proceed in all directions at my command
fierce monkeys comparable to clouds and mountains in appearance shall go as though covering the sky from here at my command
having heard sugrivas command hanuman son of the windgod sent powerful monkeys in all directions
the monkeys ordered by the king traversed the pathway of birds and heavenly bodies the path lord visnu had trod note the sky is called vishnupada since lord visnu set his foot on the sky in his incarnation as vamana
the messenger monkeys drove in all those living on the sea shore mountains forests as well as banks of lakes in order to serve the cause of rama
in response to the command of the king who was like death to them the monkeys came at once driven by fear from sugriva
then three crores of swiftfooted monkeys dark like collyrium rushed forth to the mountain to meet rama
ten crores of monkeys shining like pure molten gold staying on the best of mountains where the sun sets moved towards kishkinda
from the peaks of kailasa mountain moved out one thousand crores of monkeys who were of bright colour like the lions mane
then monkeys residing at mount himavan feeding on fruits and roots came in thousands of crores this number is called shankha it is one digit higher than mahapadma
from the vindhya mountain came down thousands of crores of swiftfooted monkeys of terrific deeds they were fierce like fire angaraka
the monkeys residents of tamala forest on the shores of the ocean of milk feeding on coconuts arrived from the groves in countless number
an army of swiftmoving monkeys came from the caves from the banks of rivers and forests as though it was swallowing up the sungod
the monkeys sent earlier to hasten all their counterparts saw mount himavat from the great tree
a divine wonderful delightful yagna dedicated to lord siva used to be performed on the beautiful himalayan mountain in the past so that the minds of all deities were satisfied
there the monkeys saw the yajna and partook the fruits and roots produced out of the havis which tasted sweet like nectar
any one who shares even a little of the divine delicious fruits and roots grown out of that havis will have no hunger or thirst for a month
the monkey leaders who lived on fruits collected the divine fruits roots as well as medicinal herbs
the monkeys also collected finesmelling flowers from the sacrificial altar to please sugriva with
the monkey leaders from all over the earth arrived quickly leading the hordes of them
in a short while the swiftmoving leaders of the monkeys groups reached kishkinda quickly
offering all kinds of medicinal herbs fruits and roots collected to sugriva the monkeys said
on hearing the report from the monkeys sugriva the king of vanaras accepted all the gifts they had brought him with great pleasure     thus ends the thirtyseventh sarga in kishkindakanda of the first epic of the holy ramayana composed by sage valmiki
on receiving all the gifts presented by the monkeys sugriva permitted them to go happy
the monkey heroes sent by sugriva performed the task assigned to them and felt powerful ramas task has been achieved a successful beginning has been made
cheering sugriva the foremost among the monkeys the mighty lakshmana said in a humble way o goodnatured sugriva if you would like to come to rama let us depart from kishkinda
hearing the gentle words of lakshmana spoken lovingly in that manner and asking him to come along with him sugriva was highly pleasedhe agreed to go with him and said as you please i abide by your command
sugriva spoke to lakshmana endowed with auspicious signs and thereupon permitted tara and other women to leave the place
sugriva called in the monkeys who deserved audience of the female folk of the royal family they came forward quickly with folded hands welcoming the heroes
then seeing the monkeys who had come there king sugriva who was shining like the sungod asked them to get a palanquin ready at once
on hearing the king the monkeys who were quick to act placed a beautiful palanquin in front of him
seeing the palanquin placed in front of sugriva the chief of the monkeys requested lakshmana to get in quickly
with this sugriva shining like the sungod entered along with lakshmana the golden palanquin carried by ablebodied monkeys
with a pale white umbrella over his head white yaktail fans and sounds of conches and drums sugriva set out receiving greetings from monkeys rejoicing in his royal glory
surrounded by hundreds of monkeys wielding various sharp weapons sugriva went forth to the region where rama resided
having reached the place where rama lived brilliant sugriva along with lakshmana descended from the palanquin
thereafter sugriva followed by the monkeys approached rama and stood with folded hands
rama was pleased on beholding the great army of monkeys standing resembling a pond full of lotus buds
sugriva touched ramas feet bending his head down and rama lifted him up and embraced him with love and great regard
embracing him rama offered him a seat on the ground and said
o best among the heroic monkeys a king who apportions his time properly towards pursuit of dharma artha and kama is a hero and deserves to be a king
one who neglects dharma and artha and pursues only kama sensuous enjoyment is like a man asleep on top of the tree waking up only to realize that he has fallen down
o king of monkeys slayer of enemies the time to act has arrived think of the strategies with your ministers and other monkeys
on hearing this sugriva said to ramao longarmed one the fortune fame and soverignty of vanaras which was lost has been regained only by your grace
o victorious lord he who does not repay the help got through your grace and your brothers is despicable among men
o destroyer of enemies hundreds of strong vanara chiefs gathered from all over the earth have reached here

the monkeys who can kill ogre ravana and his relatives in battle and bring back maithili will be arriving shortly
the wise statesman rama observing the efforts of sugriva and his attendants looked like a blooming blue lotus through delight     thus ends of thirtyeighth sarga in kishkindakanda of the first epic the holy ramayana composed by sage valmiki
on hearing sugriva who stood with folded hands rama the foremost among the upholders of righteousness hugged him and said
o scorcher of enemies gentle sugriva it will not be strange if indra showers rain if the sun in the sky dispels darkness with his thousand rays and if the moon cools down the earth with his light and a person like you helps his friend
o gentle sugriva this your help to me is not surprising you always help your friends and speak in a pleasing manner
o friend i will win over all enemies in war supported by youyou are a goodhearted friend and you alone should help me
just as anuhlada son of hiranyakasipu and brother of prahlada took away poulomi sachi daughter of puloma deceiving indra this lowly demon took away sita daughter of the king of videha
i will kill ravana with my sharp arrows just as indra who had done a hundred sacrifices killed the proud father of poulomi
in the mean while the dust raised by army of monkeys all over obscured the intense heat from the sky and the radiance of the thousandrayed sun

sugriva mentioned about the capacity of hanuman the best of monkeys as he knew he would surely succeed in accomplishing the task
sugriva king of the monkeys spoke highly pleased to hanuman the warrior son of the windgod advancing towards him
o best of monkeys i scarcely see a hero comparable to your speed on earth or in space or sky or heaven or water
o hero o great monkey in movement speed brilliance and quickness you are similar to your mighty father the windgod
i do not know any living being equal to you in brilliance on this earth therefore you alone know how to secure sitago ahead
o learned hanuman i am of opinion that in you alone rest strength wisdom prowess ability to act in accordance with time and place and knowledge of statecraft
having understood that hanuman was capable of accomplishing the goal rama started reflecting as follows
this monkey king sugriva has confidence in hanuman that he will by all means accomplish the task
the king sugriva knows for sure that if hanuman goes forth success is assured so he favours him
the mighty rama was happy in his heart to see hanuman he felt as if the task is achieved
rama scorcher of enemies gladly gave hanuman a ring inscribed with his name as a mark of identification by princess sita and said
o distinguished monkey janakas daughter will greet you without any hesitation when you present this signet to her she will know that you have come from me
o great hero your enterprise prowess coupled with courage and sugrivas message to you seem to indicate to me about the success of your mission
the foremost among the monkeys took the ring given to him placed it on his forehead and saluated it with folded palms he then prostrated at the feet of rama and departed
like the moon adorned by hosts of stars in the cloudless sky the mighty heroic hanuman the great son of the windgod shone in the midst of the army of monkeys
o hanuman son of the windgod o valiant among the vanaras i bank on your strength do whatever you can with your mighty valour so that the daughter of janaka can be found     thus ends the fortyfourth sarga in kishkindakanda of the first epic the holy ramayana composed by sage valmiki
summoning the entire body of vanaras sugriva the bull among monkeys said go to the places i have described and look for sita in order to fulfil ramas objective
having understood sugrivas strict orders the forces of monkeys started moving they spread like locusts all over the earth
rama accompanied by lakshmana stayed back at prasravana mountain looking forward for the expiry of the month fixed for the monkeys to trace sitas whereabouts
then the monkey warrior satavali departed for the north surrounded by kings of mountains
vinata leader of the monkeys set out for the eastern directionthe troop leader son of the windgod along with angada and tara left for the south inhabited by agastya
the chieftain sushena tiger among the monkeys started quickly for the fearsome western direction ruled by varuna
sugriva chief of the army of monkeys having sent the leaders to all quarters felt relieved and rejoiced
addressed thus by the king all the monkeys departed quickly from there for their respective directions with all enthusiasm
the powerful monkeys went gallopping and chattering leaping and screaming
thus addressed by the king the leaders of the monkeys shouted we will kill ravana and get back sita
i shall kill ravana singlehanded in war and quickly get back janakas daughter churning the enemy army said one
i will alone restore sita exhausted and trembling in fear even from the nether world wait here said another leader
i will smash trees shatter mountains cleave the earth and churn up the seas said a another
i can doubtless cross a distance of a hundred yojanas said one another said i can leap a hundred yojanas more
when the chieftains of the monkeys left rama enquired sugriva how he had come to know the regions of the entire earth which is a mandala a circular form
then offering reverential salutation to rama sugriva said i shall narrate in detail listen o bull among men
vali chased the demon dundubhi in buffalo form into a cave of mount malaya in order to kill him
then i waited at the entrance of the cave with due loyalty a year passed yet vali did not return
there seeing the cave overflowing with the gushing blood i was bewildered thinking that my brother might have been killed i suffered intense agony
thereafter convinced that my brother was killed i placed a mountainsize rock at the entrance of the cave so that dundubhi will be destroyed unable to come out of the cave
i lost hope of his life and came back to kishkinda having got the kingdom and also ruma and tara i was anointed king and ruled it fearlessly with all friends
the evilminded vali having lost his selfcontrol ran after me in anger to kill me and my ministers i kept running
then i ran in the eastern direction and saw many trees lakes rivers and beautiful mountains
there i saw filled with minerals the mountain behind which the sun rises and the milky ocean frequented by the apsaras
o king chased thus by vali i ran and turned back and ran againfast
then chased by vali i changed my present direction from the east towards the southern quarter where vindhya mountain stood with its beautiful sandal trees
i was looking at the trees and mountains in the southern direction i reached the western quarter pursued by vali
looking at the places around i reached the best of mountains where the sun sets i found vali still chasing me and ran towards the north
i saw himavan and mount meru on the north and the northern sea still pursued by vali i could not know where to go when wise hanuman spoke to me these words
i remembed matangas curse to vali king of monkeys vali would not enter the site of matangas hermitage as his head would break into a hundred pieces if he did therefore we thought it would be safe for us to reside in that place
o prince rama then i reached mount rishyamuka which vali did not enter out of fear of the curse of matanga
o king that way i surveyed the entire earth directly and returned to this cave and lived here     thus ends the fortysixth sarga in kishkindakanda of the first epic the holy ramayana composed by sage valmiki
the leaders of vanara troops went fast in all directions to look for vaidehi following the instructions of the king of vanaras
they went looking everywhere in the tanks in the bottom of rivers in towns in the sky and similarly in inaccessible rivers mountains and forts surrounded by rivers
the troop leaders of the monkeys instructed by sugriva searched in all places including mountains and forests
the monkeys used to search for sita all day determinedly and at night assemble at one place
the monkeys would search all day and by night reach for rest the branches of the trees that bear fruits in all seasons
the monkey leaders thus spent a month doing what they did daily and returning disappointed met the monkey king on mount prasravana
having searched for sita as instructed by sugriva powerful vinita returned along with the ministers unable to find sita
then the great monkey hero satabali came back from the northern direction along with the army after searching in vain for sita
sushena searched for a full month in the western quarter along with the monkeys and returned to report to sugriva
sushena came to sugriva seated with rama at prasravana mountain offered salutations and spoke
we searched for her in the mountains in inaccessible forests in rivers and seas and also the countryside
we searched for her in the caves in places filled with extensive vines and huge bushes and in all places mentioned by you
we searched again and again the interior inaccessible and uneven locationsand killed huge animals we searched in regions difficult to penetrate
o king of monkeys we hope his exhalted highness the mighty vanara son of the windgod hanuman has gone in the direction in which maithili has been carried off he alone will find sita and come back     thus ends the fortyseventh sarga in kishkindakanda of the first epic the holy ramayana composed by sage valmiki
hanuman the monkey accompanied by tara and angada proceeded as instructed by sugriva in the south direction
he went a long distance with other heroic monkeys searching in the impenetrable caves of vindhya mountain they combed interior places mountain peaks fortresses surrounded by rivers lakes extensive groves of trees bushes and thickets
the heroic monkeys went searching all over the direction for the daughter of janaka but in vain
the unassailable monkeys ate roots and fruits and halted here and there at different places searching for sita
they searched in dense forests interior locations impassable desolate and terrific without water and people
having searched all over in the forests and very difficult areas the fearless invincible vanaras moved forward leaving that place and entered another areasearching
as they marched forward they entered a location where there were trees devoid of leaves flowers and fruits and rivers without water and a place where it was difficult to get roots for food
there were no buffaloes no deer no elephants tigers or even birds and other wild animals
there were no medicinal plants no vines or creepers spreading on the groundthe lotus creepers on the dry ground had shining leavesbeautiful and fragrant blooms devoid of bees
there was a sage called kandu who was truthful outrageous and shorttempered he observed strict austerities and was rich in penance
the great sage was enraged because he had lost his sixteenyearold son in the forest
cursed by the great righteous sage the entire forest turned barren unfit to harbour living beings and became devoid of even beasts and birds
the monkeys searched in the forest regions in the mountains rivers and sources of rivers with concentrated attention
eager to please sugriva the great souls searched in the forest region even there they could not find janakas daughter and also ravana who had abducted sita
then they noticed a place covered with creepers and bushes as soon as they entered the dreadful forest they saw a demon of wicked deeds unafraid even of gods
the monkeys beheld the dreadful demon standing firmly like a huge incomparable mountain in front of them
seeing the monkeys the infuriated demon ran towards them raising his fist firmly saying you are all as good as dead now that i have caught you
mistaking him for ravana angada valis son at once pounced on him and slapped him with his palm
struck by valis son the demon vomitting blood from the mouth fell down on the ground like a mountain uprooted
he breathed his last and the monkeys who won went searching almost all over the mountain caves
again they searched the forest and entered another dreadful mountain cave
wise angada exhausted after the search collected the monkeys and consoling them said slowly
we have searched here there everywhere in dense forests hills forts impenetrable caverns and mountain ranges but we could find neither janaki who is like a goddess nor the demon who abducted her
you should keep searching on till we see sita janakas daughter giving up laziness and sorrow and sleep that is overpowering us
it is said zeal capability and fortitude can overcome defeat and lead to success therefore i am saying this
search this impenetrable forest even now o you denizens of this forest give up grief let us all once again ransack this forest
sugriva the monkey king is wrathful and awards severe punishment we should ever bear in mind the purpose of the great self rama
i have said all this for your good you may carry it out if it pleases you speak freely if there is any other course left for all of us o monkeys
having heard angada gandhamadana worn out by thirst and exhaustion replied in a feeble tone
what angada says is appropriate beneficial and also favourable carry out his command
once again let us explore the mountains caverns forests desolate places and mountain streams
once again the monkeys rose up and started exploring the mountain ranges of vindhya and the forests surrounding the southern side
eager to find sita the best of monkeys climbed the silver mountain rich with peaks and caverns resembling the autumnal clouds and looked out into the lodhra grove and the garden of seven leaves banara plantations
even after scaling up the peak the exhausted heroic monkeys could not find vaidehi the dear queen of rama
having looked all over the mountain and many caverns those monkeys got down from the mountain
descending to the foothills the exhausted monkeys became quiet fatigued and disheartened they assembled under a tree stood for a moment and then lay down
resting for a while the frustrated monkeys resumed their search throughout the southern direction
the bulls among vanaras and hanuman the chief of the group again started exploring everywhere in the vindhya range starting from the beginning     thus ends the fortyninth sarga in kishkindakanda of the first epic the holy ramayana composed by sage valmiki
hanuman together with the monkeys tara and angada searched in the impenetrable places and caves of vindhya
they also searched near rivers mountain streams hill ranges caves of lions and tigers in the rock shelters and difficult spots of vast mountains
they reached the end of the southwest side of the mountainvindhya while they were still there the time stipulated for them to find sita had slipped
the son of the windgod hanuman searched all over the mountains and caves and woods difficult to access in that southwestern region of the mountain
having explored the region surrounded by a network of mountains gaja gavaksha gavaya sarabha gandhamadana mainda and also dvivida sushena jambavan angada the heir apparent tara the forestdweller staying close to one another and hanuman too not far from the others searched in the southern direction while they were exploring they saw the mouth of a large cave called rikshabilam which had its mouth open guarded by a demon
overcome with hunger and thirst the exhausted monkeys noticed a huge cave covered with creepers and bushes while they were looking around for water
just then the kraunchas swans geese and chakravaka drenched in water with their limbs reddened with the pollen of lotuses were fluttering out of the cave
the bulls among the monkeys were bewildered when they reached the cave which was difficult to access
the brilliant host of monkeys experienced both fear and joy to see the cave difficult to enter
the cave was crowded with creatures of different kinds it looked like the abode of the king of demons difficult to enter dreadful and impenetrable
then hanuman son of the windgod who appeared like a huge mountain and knew about forests spoke to the fellowmonkeys
going round the places covering all mountain ranges in the southern direction we are spent but we could not see maithili
from this cave have emerged several birds like sarasas swans kraunchas and chakravakas drenched in water surely there must be a source of plenty of water or well or a pond moreover there are shining green trees at the entrance of the cave suggesting subsoil water
on hearing him the monkeys entered the cave full of darkness there was no light of the moon or the sun it was a horripilating experience
the tigers among the monkeys entered the dark cave reverberating with the sounds of lions beasts and birds
the monkeys could not fix their eyes anywheretheir lustre or valour could not help them they moved like wind uninterrupted and their vision was lost in darkness
as the elephantlike monkeys entered the cave quickly they saw bright light and an excellent delightful place
holding one anothers hands they went in for a distance of one yojana inside the cave that was densely covered with several kinds of trees
having nearly lost their senses without water to drink the thirsty and bewildered monkeys were desperate for waterthey wandered in the cave without feeling lazy for some time
exhausted and enfeebled they saw with dejected faces a gleam of light at a time when they were desparate
having reached inside the cave the monkeys saw a forest shining like blazing fire dispelling the surrounding darkness there they noticed sala tala tamala punnaga vanjjula dhava champaka and naga trees they also saw blossoming plants of karnikara bunches of beautiful golden flowers and tender redcoloured leavesthey saw wonderful trees with creepers on top entwining them and ornamented with gold like golden fruits radiant like the dazzling rising sun there were altars encrusted with precious sapphire and vaidurya the golden trees were shining bright there were lotus creepers looking like sapphire and vaiduryathe ponds were filled with golden lotuses and were surrounded by birds
there they saw golden fishes and huge tortoises in the pellucid water of the tank filled with lotus creepers
the vanaras beheld highrise palaces built with gold and silver the windows fixed on the roof were golden shaped like cows eye with lattices of pearls they also saw best of houses built in gold silver and clay decorated with precious gems including vaidurya
they saw trees bright like corals in full bloom and ripe fruits golden bees were found hovering around making all kinds of honey
they saw all over rich collections of beds couches and highly valuable vehicles decorated beautifully with gems and goldthey also saw a large collection of shining utensils made of gold silver and bronze
there they noticed a wonderful collection of incense and sandal tasty and pure eatables roots and fruits
they found excellent drinks and many kinds of honey wonderful collections of clothes colourful blankets and heaps of animal skin
the monkeys marked here and there a collection of gold glittering like blazing fire
while searching here and there in the cave the strong and powerful monkeys discovered a woman not far from there
she was an ascetic in bark robes and deer skin blazing with lustre restrained in her food the monkeys got very frightened
the amazed monkeys stopped there hanuman enquired who are you whose cave is this
then hanuman who was of the size of a mountain greeted the old lady with folded hands and enquired her who are you to whom does this mansion this cave and these gems belong     thus ends of fiftieth sarga in kishkindakanda of the first epic of the holy ramayana composed by sage valmiki
on meeting the distinguished righteous ascetic woman robed in deer skin hanuman said
we are exhausted with thirst and hunger we are fatigued hence we entered this dark cave all at oncewithout waiting for permission
thirst drove us into this cave on earth we are amazed at the kind of many wonderful objects here and have nearly lost our senses we are tormented with pain
to whom do these golden trees resembling the rising sun belong for whom are these tasty roots and fruits whose are these manystoreyed golden houses with glittering windows adorned with silver lattices encrusted with gems
by whose prowess are these golden trees yielding sacred fragrant flowers and fruits how are these golden lotuses created in the clear water how is it that here are golden fishes and tortoises whose fruit of penance is this is it by your power we do not know you should tell all of us everything
the noble ascetic committed to the welfare of all beings replied to hanumans enquiry
o bull among monkeys this golden forest was created by the magical power of a deceitful demon called maya
this best of wonderful mansions has been constructed earlier by visvakarma the chief architect of the demons
he maya performed rigorous penance in the dense forest for thousands of years seeking the favour of brahma the creator and obtained a boon that he should inherit all the wealth of usanas shukra
then the mighty maya who received the power of executing desires created this mansion and lived here happily for some time in this dense forest
seeing this great demon in love with a heavenly apsara nymph called hema lord indra with all his might attacked him with his thunderbolt
thus this wonderful forest and the golden house with all luxury were given away permanently to hema by the creator brahma
o best of monkeys daughter of meru sauvarni i am svayamprabha selfilluminator caretaker of this house of hema meru sauvarni is the eleventh manu
hema wellversed in dance and music is a fast friend to me she granted a boon that none can resist me and gave this house of which i am the caretaker
what is your mission for what purpose have you come to this inaccessible forest what are you looking forhow did you find this
eat these wonderful roots and fruits and have these drinks and then tell me all about you     thus ends of the fiftyfirst sarga in kishkindakanda of the first epic the holy ramayana composed by sage valmiki
after the monkey leaders had taken rest the noble ascetic with undiverted attention said these words
o monkeys if you have been relieved of your fatigue after eating fruits now tell me about yourself if you think it can be told i want to hear
when hanuman son of the windgod heard her he started narrating frankly and truthfully
rama son of dasaratha a prosperous king of all the worlds comparable to indra and varuna came to the dandaka forest along with his brother laksmana and wife vaidehi ravana abducted his wife from janasthana
we along with the dreadful monkeys are sent with angada as our chief to the southern direction guarded by yama and inhabited by sage agasti we are commanded to search sita princess of videha and also the abode of the demon ravana who assumes any form at his free will
we were all exhausted lost in thought and worried unable to cross this deep ocean of sorrow we did not know how to proceed
then while we were looking around we saw this cave concealed by trees and vines with darkness spread all over
drenched in water the swans kuraras and sarasas were seen emerging with water dripping from thier wings
i suggested to the fellowmonkeys to enter this cave inferring that there would be water and all of them came to the same conclusion
we said let us enter since we were in a hurry to carry out our kings ordersthen we jumped in holding one anothers hand
vexed and starved we entered this grotto shrouded in darknessthis is our task and we reached here in the process
you have given us roots and fruits out of hospitality and we have been taken them driven by hunger and thirst
we were dying from hunger when you saved us tell us what the monkeys can do to repay your debt
to the leaders among the monkeys knowers of dharma who said this svayamprabha replied
i am very much pleased with all of you smart monkeys as i am engaged in the practice of righteousness i do not need your services     thus ends the fiftysecond sarga in kishkindakanda of the first epic the holy ramayana composed by sage valmiki
to the auspicious words of the righteous blameless hermitess hanuman replied
you are a righteous lady you have given us refuge now in moving about the cave we have exceeded the time limit given by sugriva
o righteous lady we have a great task waiting we are afraid of sugriva as we could not accomplish our objective by staying here save us
to the words of hanuman the ascetic replied i consider it difficult for any one who enters here to go back alive
i will help all monkeys out of this cave by virtue of my power of asceticism duly practised
happy at the prospect of getting out of the cave they all not only closed their eyes but also covered them with their delicate fingers
then the great monkeys faces covered with their hands emerged from the cave in a moment
the righteous hermitess released all the monkeys out of that difficult situation and said these words of consolation
this vindhya mountain has a rich collection of trees and bushes this is prasravana hill and this is the great oceano monkeys good luck to you now i am going back home having said so svayamprabha entered the splendid cave
then the monkeys saw the boundless dreary ocean roaring wild with its terrific waves spread all over
while they were ransacking the impassable mountain created with the magical powers of maya the time limit of one month set by the king was over
then the highsoul monkeys reached the hill adjacent to vindhya mountain on which trees were in full bloomthey sat there lost in thought
alarmed at the thought of transgression of time limit the monkeys kept looking at the tree tops entwined with a hundred oreepers heavily loaded with the flowers of spring
having realised looking at the flowers that spring has set in and they have exceeded the time limit they all fell down on the ground
coming to a conclusion after due deliberation angada heir apparent profoundly wise endowed with sturdy and broad shoulders like those of a lion or a bull spoke in a sweet voice to the elderly respectable monkeys dwellers of the forest
o monkeys dont you realize that all of us have come here at the command of the monkey king and while we were in the cave a whole month has gone by
we started our journey in the month of ashvayuja with a certain time limit that has exceeded what is the future course of action
you are all celebrated for bravery and incomparable in your activities you have followed me in obedience to the orders of the tawnyeyed sugriva
we should be killed since we have failed to achieve the objective of finding sita there is no doubt about it who can live in peace without executing the orders of the king
now that the time limit fixed by sugriva has expired the right thing to do for the monkeys is to fast unto death
by nature sugriva is harsh and being a king now he will not forgive us who are real offenders and have not done the task assigned
surely the king will torture us by awarding death sentence in a singular manner when we go back it is better for us to meet death here itself
i was not installed as heir apparent by sugriva i was made crowned prince by king rama the king of the people who never hurts others
the monkeyking nursed bitter enmity against me even earlier now seeing my lapse he will decidedly inflict severe punishment on me
i do not want my friends to see my calamity my death i shall sit here on the sacred shores of this ocean and await my death
hearing the young heir apparent thus speaking the best of the monkeys kindly responded
by nature sugriva is harsh rama is devoted to his wife therefore if sugriva sees that we have not found vaidehi and have returned without fulfilling the mission he will award death sentence to us in order to please ramathere is no doubt
those who have failed in their mission being offenders should not go to meet the king offenders are not forgiven here itself we will search for sita and if we are able to know her whereabouts we will go back or else we will go to the abode of yama
on hearing the words of the frightened monkeys tara said enough of this sorrow if it pleases you we will all go to the cave and reside there
this cave built by magic is inaccessible it has a number of trees water eatables and drinks if we live here we need not be afraid of even indra the breaker of enemy citadels or even of rama or also of the king of monkeys
all the monkeys agreed to the favourable suggestion of tara which was acceptable to angada a plan may be made in such a way by which we will not be killed by the king our strategy should be delinked from the conditions laid down by the king let us not face punishment said the monkeys     thus ends the fiftythird sarga in kishkindakanda of the first epic the holy ramayana composed by sage valmiki
hanuman listened to the proposal of tara whose face was like the moon lord of the stars after listening to tara he thought angada might take over the kingdom from sugriva
hanuman thought valis son possessed in addition to his intellect eight kinds of limbs four kinds of strength and fourteen qualities required of a king
hanuman proceeded to win over angada who was ever shining in strength and valour who was growing in majesty constantly like the moon in the bright fornight whose intellectual prowess was equal to that of brhaspati who was equal to his father in valour and who was wellversed in all sastras angada was listening totara like indra listened to sukra preceptor of the demons
resorting to the third strategy out of the four ways of achieving an objective hanuman created differences among the monkeys with skilful arguments sama dana bheda and danda are the four means hanuman adopted bheda as a means of winning over an enemy
when there were differences among the monkeys over the issue hanuman intimidated angada with frightening words expressing his anger using skilful arguments
o son of tara you are indeed very efficient like your father in combat you can hold firmly the responsibilty of the vanara kingdom like your father
o leader among monkeys vanaras are always fickleminded being away from their sons and wives they will not always carry out your command and stay here forever
this i am telling you openly and frankly these monkeys are not going to be obedient to you neither jambavan nor nila nor the great monkey suhotra nor even myself would subscribe to this opinion of staying in the cave and follow you it is not possible for you to keep us or these monkeys from sugriva through the policy of appeasement like sama dana bheda or even danda persuasion giving gifts creating differences or imposing punishment
it is said that when a strong man fights a weak one the weak opponent should adopt the strategy of asana watching for selfprotection the weak should not enter into combat with the strong
you may think it safe to stay here in this opening of the earth it is a petty task for the arrows of lakshmana to break open this socalled cave
in the past indra had done a small damage to the cave with his thunderbolt but with his sharp arrows lakshmana will shatter the cave easily as though it is a leaf cup
lakshmna has many such iron arrows that are equal to the thunderbolt they can even split the mountains
o scorcher of enemies the moment you decide to establish yourself here all these monkeys will surely desert you
the memory of their sons and wives will haunt these hungry monkeys the inconvenient bed will make them so depressed that they will leave you behind
left out of your friends and relativeswho are your wellwishers you will be very frightened even by the trembling of a blade of grass
in progress
it is not that lakshmanas dreadful arrows flying at great speed will not torture you it will be difficult for you to avert them as they are eager to kill an escaping enemy
if along with us you approach sugriva in a humble manner he will make you his successor to the kingdom
your fathers brother is virtuous wellintentioned loving steadfast in action and true to his promise he will not kill you
on hearing hanumans humble words of advice consistent with righteousness and full of devotion to his master the king angada said
sugriva has no steadfastness purity of body and mind compassion rectitude valour and patience
he usurped his elder brothers queen while he was still alive it is morally abominable since an elder brothers wife is like a mother how can a person who blocks the entrance of a cave while his noble brother is engaged in fighting inside be treated as righteous
illustrious rama who faithfully held his hand was forgotten after he received his help indeed whose help would he remember
sugriva ordered search for sita out of fear of lakshmana and not out of fear of unrighteousness how can such a man be pious
he is a sinner and an ungrateful person as he does not remember others help he is fickleminded which respectable person will believe him which member of his family will wish to live
if i am the kings son virtuous or otherwise i will be installed in the kingdom as successor how can sugriva suffer me to live when i am his enemys descendant
my alternate strategy has failed i have already made a mistake by announcing my plan my advisors are holding different views i am powerless how can a weakling an orphan like me live in kishkinda
sugriva is deceitful cruel and treacherous he will inflict secret punishment on me by way of imprisonment for the sake of the kingdom
it is better for me to fast unto death rather than suffer imprisonment permit me to do so you may all go back
i swear i will not return to the city i will fast unto death here only death for me is desirable
convey my greetings with due courtesy to rama and lakshmana on my behalf and my respects to my fathers younger brother king of monkeys sugriva and wish him well
you should convey my mother as well as ruma my good wishes for their health and wellbeing you should console my mother tara also
by nature my mother is compassionate she is fond of me but she is helpless on hearing about my death she will certainly give up her life
having expresed so much of his feelings disheartened angada saluted the elderly monkeys and started crying then he spread the darbha grass and lay down on the ground
seeing him lie down the bulls among the monkeys became sad and shed hot tears from their eyes
blaming sugriva and praising vali all the companions of angada sat there surrounding him after having decided to fast unto death
with the opinion of valis son ascertained all the great monkeys thought it proper to die they sipped water and assembled on the northern shore of the sea facing the east with the darbha grass spread on the ground their edges pointing southward
overtaken by the fear of death the monkeys kept talking about ramas exile into the forest dasarathas death destruction of demons in janasthana the death of jatayu abduction of sita valis death and ramas anger
while the numerous monkeys resembling peaks of high mountains were roaring it resounded through the mountain caves it was like the sound of the stormy thunderclouds     thus ends the fiftyfifth sarga in kishkindakanda of the first epic the holy ramayana composed by sage valmiki
while the monkeys were preparing to fast unto death on the plateau of the mountain sampati the prosperous king of vultures the longlived elder brother of jatayu widely known for his strength appeared there
coming out of the cave of the great mount vindhya sampati was glad to see the monkeys seated there and said to himself
destiny rules the world of men in accordance with a divine arrangement or else it would not have brought me food after a long time of fasting the monkeys are food for sampati
looking at them the vulture continued i will eat these monkeys one after the other as and when they die
hearing the words of the vulture greedily waiting for food deeply dejected angada spoke to hanuman
see yama son of vaivasvata has arrived here in person to destroy the monkeys in the name of sita sita became the direct agent for causing the destruction of monkeys
ramas task has not been performed sugrivas order has not been excuted and now suddenly this calamity has overtaken the monkeys unawares
we have heard in detail about the task accomplished by jatayu the king of vultures in order to please sita the princess of videha
bound by friendship and compassion each one helps the other in fact jatayu did this by giving up his life on his own for the sake of rama
jatayu the knower of dharma has laid down his life for the wellbeing of rama we are exhausted in the process of helping rama we have lost hope of our lives after entering these forests yet we have failed to find the princess from mithila
the king of vultures was slain by ravana in a combat he attained supreme status he had no fear for sugriva as we have
the survival of monkeys has become doubtful due to the death of jatayu death of king dasaratha and the abduction of the princess from videha
the exile of rama and lakshmana into the forest along with sita so also the death of vali and of the demons in the hands of rama due to his anger are all evil consequences of a boon granted to kaikeyi
the wise king of vultures was shaken up mentally on seeing the monkeys lying on the ground and hearing the unhappy narration of angada      thus ends the fiftysixth sarga in kishkindakanda of the first epic the holy ramayana composed by sage valmiki
on hearing the words that came from angadas mouth the sharpbeaked loudvoiced vulture sampati said
who is it that was pronouncing loudly the death of my dearest brother jatayu this news has shaken my mind
i heard my brothers name today after a long timei wish to know how the demon and the vulture fought at janasthana
i wish to be brought down from this inaccessible mountain peak by all of you i am glad to have heard from you the name of my younger brother after a long time he is virtuous valiant and praiseworthy
o bulls among monkeys i desire to hear about the death of my brother jatayu who was dwelling at janasthana
how did dasaratha develop friendship with my brother i hear that rama who is the favourite firstborn of dasaratha has endeared himself to all elders
o tamers of foes as my wings are burnt down by the suns rays it is not possible for me to move forward i wish you help me to get down from this mountain
the leaders among monkeys did not trust his words even though his voice was choked with grief they suspected his intentions
on seeing the vulture the monkeys fasting unto death got a terrible thought in their minds that the vulture might eat them
since we wish to die we will be accomplishing our objective successfully if he eats us soon
thus thought the chief among the monkeys angada having helped the vulture come down the mountain peak said
o powerful bird my revered grandfather riksharaja was a glorious king of monkeys he had two sons called sugriva and valiboth were strong like floodwaters my father vali was wellknown in this world for his remarkable deeds
the great warrior rama is the son of dasaratha the scion of the ikshvaku race and the king of the entire world he entered dandaka forest along with his brother lakshmana and consort vaidehi obeying his fathers command following a righteous path
his wife was abducted from janasthana by ravana the king of vultures jatayu a friend of ramas father observed princess of videha being forcibly carried away through the aerial region
jatayu destroyed ravanas aerial chariot and put maithili in a safe place but being old and exhausted he was killed in a combat by ravana
thus the vulture was slain by ravana who was stronger cremated by rama and his last rites performed he reached the supreme heavenly abode it was the luck of jatayu unlike dasaratha to be cremated by rama
then rama made friendship with my fathers brother great self sugriva and killed my father
on hearing the pathetic words from the monkeys who had given up hope of life the loudvoiced vulture wailing replied
o monkeys the one you said to have been killed by mighty ravana in a combat was my younger brother jatayu
even after i have heard this i cannot avenge my brothers death as i am old i have no wings and i have no energy enough to fight
in olden days when indra killed vrutra we jatayu and i seeking to challenge him reached the sun blazing with a garland of beams
flying in the sky at a violently high speed we reached the meridian of the sun when unable to bear the heat jatayu became weak
seeing my brother tormented due to the suns radiance i was overwhelmed with grief out of love i covered him with both my wings
o bulls among monkeys consequently my wings were burnt and i dropped down on vindhya here i have been living knowing not my brothers whereabouts
to these words of jatayus brother sampati angada the learned heir apparent replied
i have heard you if you are the brother of jatayu tell us about the abode of that demon if you know
tell us about ravana king of the demons who is unaware of the consequences if you know his residence tell us if it is near or far
then jatayus elder brother the glorious sampati said these pleasing befitting words
o monkeys i am a vulture my wings are burnt and my strength is depleted the only substantial help i can render rama is through my words
i know varunas worldsseas and oceans and all the three worlds measured by three strides by vamana indeed i also know about the friction between the great gods and demons and the churning of the ocean for nectar
ramas work is my primary duty but my strength is drained by age and i have lost my vitality
i saw a young lady of beautiful appearance adorned with all kinds of ornaments borne away by the evilminded ravana that dainty lady was calling out o rama o lakshmana and was crying aloud she was throwing away her ornaments and was wriggling to get out of ravanas grip
her fine silk garment was shining like the radiance of the sun on the mountain peak like lightning against the dark cloud that was ravana
since she was uttering ramas name i think she is sita now i will tell you about the demons abode listen
he is vishravas son and halfbrother of vaishravana his name is ravana and he resides in the city of lanka
the beautiful city of lanka is an island a hundred yojanas away from hereit was built by visvakarma
the city has golden gates golden platforms huge goldencoloured uniformly built mansions surrounded by a tall boundary wall of the colour of sunlight
you will see in the city of lanka the princess from videha daughter of janaka a picture of dejection robed in silk confined in the harem of ravana wellprotected by demonesses
o monkeys traverse a hundred yojanas across the sea on reaching the southern coast you will be able to see ravanas lanka defended and surrounded by the sea now proceed swiftly and prove your strength
by intuition i know you would see sita and return on the first plane you will see sparrows and birds which live on grain on the second you will see crows living on the food offered to the dead and birds living on the fruits of trees and then cocks cranes and kraunchas moving on the third plane on the fourth hawks and falcons and on the fifth vultures
o bulls among monkeys swans blessed with strength vigour beauty and youth move in the sixth region beyond on the seventh plane you will see the descendants of garuda
from here i see ravana and janaki we vultures have a divine golden vision and great power
o monkeys therefore by the strength of food and by nature we can always see beyond a hundred yojanas from this edge
our movement and vision naturally extends to distant places for those fighting on foot the movement is restricted to the extent of foot movement
look out for some means to cross the salty ocean you will see vaidehi and return your mission accomplished
take me to the ocean the abode of varuna i intend to offer oblation to my brother a great soul who is in heaven
th mightiest of monkeys carried sampati whose wings were totally burnt to the sea shore and after he had offered oblations took him back to the same place having obtained all information from the king of vultures the monkeys were very happy     thus ends the fiftyeighth sarga in kishkindakanda of the first epic the holy ramayana composed by sage valmiki
the mighty monkeys were delighted to hear the nectarlike words of the king of vultures
jambavan the king of bears got up at once from the ground along with the monkeys and spoke to the king of vultures
where is sita now by whom else was she seen while being carried pray tell us everything you are the ultimate saviour of monkeys
who is not aware of ramas swift arrows which are like thunderbolt who is not able to assess the speed and power of arrows of lakshmana released directly
pleased to see the happiness and eagernes of the monkeys assembled to hear about sita sampati continued in order to reassure them
now hear by whom i was informed about the abduction of the largeeyed princess from videha and where she is at present
with my vitality and prowess depleted i have been staying for a long time on this mountain extended by several yojanas and inaccessible
reduced to this state i have been maintained by food given in time by my son named suparshva best among birds
gandharvas have intense passion serpents show violent anger deer have great fear and we vultures have great hunger
once my son came to me without meat after sunset while i was feeling hungry for food
i was thinking tormented with hunger my son who always keeps me happy told me exactly what had happened
o dear father i went to get food at the right time and stood blocking the entrance of mount mahendra
there i stood alone looking down obstructing the path of thousands of creatures inhabiting the ocean
i saw a person who was dark and huge like a mass of collyrium carrying a lady whose radiance was like the rising sun
since i was looking for food i resolved to seize both of them but he asked me in a gentle and courteous manner to make way since i was blocking the aerial path
who will strike polite people even the mean do not do it anywhere and what to speak of me
he flew hurriedly with splendour as though he was enveloping the sky making it small all the flying creatures in the sky came and greeted me with respect
i heard the great sages saying o dear you are lucky to be saved he has somehow gone from here with that lady without hurting you undoubtedly you are lucky
i was greeted by the most illustrious siddhas i came to know from them that he was ravana the king of demons i was looking at him while he was abducting janakas daughter who was the wife of dasarathas rama her ornaments had dropped and silken robes had slipped since she lost hold on herself she was crying loudly calling out the names of rama and lakshmana her hair dishevelled
o father this is the cause of my delay said suparshva who knew the value of time thus he gave the entire account to me
even after hearing this i could not advance against ravana how could i a vulture without wings leap even a little
being endowed with the faculty of thinking and speech i shall tell you what is possible for you to execute with your prowess listen
i will please you with my word and thought and do not doubt that ramas task is dear to me as well
indeed you monkeys are very wise strong and sensitive the king of monkeys has sent you on this mission you cannot be conquered even by gods
the heronfeathered arrows of rama and lakshmana are sharp and strong enough to protect or subdue all the three worlds
the tenheaded ravana is mighty powerful and strong indeed but you are efficient and it will not be difficult for you to achieve this task
do not bother about the time limit resolve to achieve the objective for wise people like you should not lag behind in accepting challenges     thus ends the fiftyninth sarga in kishkindakanda of the first epic the holy ramayana composed by sage valmiki
sampati bathed and offered libations to jatayu then all the monkeys sat round him on the beautiful mountain
angada sat near sampati surrounded by all monkeys sampati who had gained confidence spoke to angada once again joyously
o monkeys i shall tell you in detail how i came to know the princess from mithila listen quietly with rapt attention
scorched by the rays of the sun i was burnt totally and fell on the peak of this mount vindhya years ago
then i looked at the oceans the mountains rivers lakes forests and all locations and my memory returned gradually
i came to know then that this place is inhabited by flocks of happy birds and full of many caves and mountain peaks this is mount vindhya on the shore of the southern ocean
there was a hermitage nearby where a revered sage who was even worshpped by gods lived his name was nishakara he did rigorous penance here
o righteous monkeys after the death of sage nishakara eight thousand years have passed and i have been living here
i descended down slowly from the high rugged peak of the vindhya mountain with great difficulty to the plain land bristling with sharp harsh darbha grass
eager to see the great sage i reached the place with much difficulty i and my brother jatayu had approached him many a time earlier
in the vicinity of that hermitage there was no tree without flowers or fruits and fragrant was the breeze that blew around
on reaching the sacred hermitage i stood and waited under a tree for the audience of the divine sage nishakara
he was followed by bears deer tigers lions elephants and snakes just as living beings follow their creator
just as the army including feudatories recede when the king comes all those creatures repaired to their dens when they knew the arrival of the sage at the hermitage
the sage who entered the hermitage came out again within a moment on seeing me and enquired about me affectionately
o gentle one seeing your body devoid of hair i can understood that your wings have been burnt and your body bruised
you are the king among vultures equal to wind in speedi had seen both the brothers earlier and both of you could change your form at will
what disease has affected you why are your wings dropped down who punished you in this way tell me     thus ends the sixtieth sarga in kishkindakanda of the first epic the holy ramayana composed by sage valmiki
then i revealed everything to the sageincluding the arrogant impetuous action of rashly following the sun for challenging indra
o revered sage i am exhausted and my senses are depressed i am ashamed of myself my body is wounded therefore i am not able to reply
deluded by pride i and my brother jatayu challenging each other to test our relative strength flew far into the sky
both of us made a bet on the peak of mount kailasa in the presence of sages to follow the sungod until he sets on the western mountain
we heard at some places sounds of musical instruments sounds of vedic chanting and many lovely young women dressed in redsinging
we flew quickly into the sky and reached the path of the sun and looked down at the forest which looked like a green lawn
the earth filled with lofty mountains appeared as if it is covered with pebbles surrounded by rivers meandering it looked as though it was entwined with threads
the mountains of the earth himavan and vindhya and the great meru looked like huge elephants in a huge pond
much sweat pain and fear generated in us while we went on and up this led to terrific confusion and stupor
i did not know which the southern direction was or the southeast or the west it looked as if the world had been consumed by fire and dissolved as if it was the end of the yuga
my mind was disturbed and i turned my attention from the object once again i focused my attention on the sun and could see the sungod with great effort the sun appeared to us equal in size to earth
without taking leave of me jatayu descended down to the earth seeing that i also followed him down quickly from the sky
i protected jatayu with my wings so that he was not burnt i however got burnt miserably and fell down from the aerial region
i thought jatayu had fallen down somewhere at janasthana but i fell on vindhya wings burnt in an unconscious state
bereft of my kingdom my brother and my wings and having lost my strength i desire to fall down from the mountain top and die     thus ends the sixtyfirst sarga in kishkindakanda of the first epic the holy ramayana composed by sage valmiki
when thus i spoke to the venerable sage in that manner roaring very painfully the divine sage replied after reflecting silently for a moment
you will get new wings and feathers and also other partsyou will attain vision life prowess and strength
i have foreseen with the power of my penance that a great task will be done by you i have also heard about it in the puranas and came to know of it
indeed in the ikshvaku family there will be a king named dasaratha he will beget a brilliant son named rama
on account of the command of his father rama armed with the strength of truth will proceed to the forest with his brother lakshmana
the king of demons ravana who is indestructible even by gods and demons will be abducting his wife from janastahana
immersed in grief chaste and famed sita will not take any food or enjoy pleasures however much she is tempted
knowing that vaidehi is not eating foodgiven by ravana indrathe ruler of gods will offer nectarlike food rare even for gods
having understood that it has been provided by indra sita will take out a large portion of it and pour it on the ground as an offering to rama and say i offer it to rama wherever he is on earth
if my husband and lakshmana are living or else even if they have attained heaven let this food be enjoyed by them sita will say
ramas messenger and other monkeys will be coming to search for the his queen o sampati you should narrate this to them
it is good for you in all respects to remain here where can you go without wings wait for appropriate time and place you will recover your wings
i am not enthusiastic about giving you the wings now remain here and carry on the work for the welfare of the world
carry on the work not only for the princes rama and lakshmana but also for the brahmins sages gods and others who live here
i also want to see rama and lakshmana but i do not like to hold on to my life for long hence i will give up my body the knower of self the sage nishakara said this to sampati      thus ends the sixtysecond sarga in kishkindakanda of the first epic the holy ramayana composed by sage valmiki
the sage who was skilful in speech having praised me thus and in many other ways permitted me to leave and entered his dwelling
having crawled slowly and slowly from the cave and climbed the vindhya i have been awaiting your arrival
more than a hundred years have passed and all this time i have borne the sages words in my heart and have waited for the right time and place
nishakara went on his last journey and attained heaven since then many sad thoughts have crisscrossed my mind and i am consumed with those thoughts
whenever i intended to die the words of the sage rang in my mind the inspiration he gave me to preserve my life removed my agony like the glowing flames of fire that take away darkness
i goaded my son with harsh words saying knowing the valour of the evilminded ravana why did you not protect her sita
even after hearing the wailing of sita knowing that both rama and lakshmana are separated from her and considering my friendship with dasaratha i felt displeased with my son as he did not make an attempt to rescue her
even as he was telling this to the monkeys his wings started appearing in their presence
he experienced an unparalleled delight seeing wings with red feathers growing on his body and said to the monkeys
by the grace of the most revered soulsage nishakara both my wings that were burnt by the suns radiance have grown again
the valour strength and even courage that i had in my youthi am experiencing now
sampati the foremost of the birds thus spoke to the monkeys and flew up from the mountains peak keen on finding the aerial path
the tigers among monkeys felt very happy on hearing the words of sampati and became sure of their success with their valour
the monkeys as strong as the wind regained courage and went in search of the daughter of janaka in the direction of abhijit constellation known as abhijit is associated with success     thus ends the sixtythird sarga in kishkindakanda of the first epic the holy ramayana composed by sage valmiki
hearing the words spoken by the king of vultures the highly courageous monkeys assembled together and leaped with joyscreaming
on hearing the words of sampati the monkeys felt glad and eager to see sita reached the ocean the passage to the abode of ravana
having reached the ocean the monkeys endowed with frightening courage stood looking at the vast ocean which appeared like an image of the whole world
powerful and heroic monkeys assembled at the northern end of the southern ocean
the ocean was of terrifying form filled with various violent species of grotesque creatures of huge bodies playing in the water full of violent tides it appeared asleep at one place and apparently sporting in another in some places it was rising as high as a mountain with huge volumes of water it was as if roaring with the demon chiefs residing in the underworld the great monkeys were worried seeing the huge ocean which created horripilation in them
all the monkeys were worried when they suddenly saw the ocean which looked impassable like the sky they wondered if they can at all accomplish the task of finding sita
angada the best among the monkeys saw the worried army despondent gazing at the ocean and comforted the frightened troops
angadathe strong and wise son of vali spoke thus to the tensed vanaras in the right time
do not be despondent it is the biggest flaw it destroys a person like an angry serpent killing a young child
if one succumbs to despondency while he has to exhibit his valour his brilliance gets diminished and he does not succeed in his manly pursuits
with the night over angada joined the older monkeys again and sought their counsel
the army of monkeys encircled angada like the army of maruts surrounding indra
who else other than the son of vali and hanuman can resist and pacify the monkeyarmy
then the illustrious angada subduer of foes took the counsel of elderly monkeys and the army into confidence and thus addressed them all in meaningful words
now which mighty monkey will cross the ocean who will prove sugriva subduer of enemies true to his promise
o monkeys which one can leap a hundred yojanas and liberate the monkey leaders from the great fear of sugriva
by whose effort can we be successful and return home happily from here to meet wives and sons
by whose grace shall we approach rama and lakshmana and even the monkey king sugriva happily
if there is any one among you who is capable of leaping across the ocean he will be giving all of us the sacred gift of life quickly
after hearing angada no one spoke a word the entire army of monkeys became still and motionless
angada the best of the monkeys again addressed them saying you are all mighty eminent and courageous born in renowned families and have been honoured again and againfor your actions
none of you at any time have faced any obstruction in doing your deeds you are efficient in leaping o bulls among monkeys now speak out who among you can fly and how far     thus ends the sixtyfourth sarga in kishkindakanda of the first epic the holy ramayana composed by sage valmiki
thereafter on hearing angada all the leaders among the monkeys gaja gavaksha gavaya sarabha gandhamadana mainda dvivida sushena and jambavan as well expressed one after the other their capability for leaping
gaja said he can leap ten yojanas and gavaksha said he can go upto twenty yojanas
then gavaya said to the monkeys i can leap thirty yojanas sarabha said i can leap forty yojanas bright ghandhamadana said i can leap as far as fifty yojanas without any doubt mainda said i can leap more than sixty yojanas highly brilliant dvivida said in turn i can no doubt leap seventy yojanas brilliant and best of the monkeys sushena declared i can leap across eighty yojanas
when the monkeys were talking of their individual capacity in that manner about their speed jambavan the oldest of the monkeys inferred their capacity and said
earlier i was also very courageous but now i have become old and reached the fag end of life
however in this situation it is not possible for us to neglect our task as it is the order of the monkeyking and rama who are determined to achieve the objective
jambavan the distinguished among the monkeys again said my strength to leap into the sky was not only that much i was stronger in my youth and could cover longer distances
in the past at the time of the wellknown yagna of king bali i was very strong i circumambulated the eternal vishnu while he was taking three strides in his incarnation of trivikrama vamana
having grown old i do not have the same courage in my youth my prowess was incomparable and none could excel me
i guess that at this time i do not have the capacity to fly to that extent achieving the objective is out of question with this much of energy
then the wise angada said to great jambavan in a gentle manner about his own strength
i can certainly go to a distance of a hundred yojanas however i cannot say whether i will have enough capacity to return
jambavan who was skilful in speech spoke to that great angada o leader among monkeys and bears your energy to cover this distance is wellknown to us
you can go upto even a hundred thousand yojanas and have the required energy to return also but it is not proper to send you because you are the heir apparent
o scorcher of enemies you are established as the commander of the army and it is proper for us to protect you as we protect our wives
o subduer of enemies in acomplishing this task you are the root o dear therefore you should always be taken care of by us just like the wife looked after
the root of any objective should be protected well this is the basis of an accomplisher only when the roots are intact the trees have the ability to yield flowers and fruits
o warrior of proven valour o subduer of enemies in achieving this objective you are the source being endowed with valour and wisdom
o best of monkeys you are the son of my guide vali and respectable we will be capable of accomplishing the goal only under your protection and guidance
jambavan the wise monkey having said that angada the great son of vali replied
if i do not go and no other monkey leader goes then we have to resort to fasting unto death once again
if i do not fulfil the objective of the wise king of monkeys i cannot save my life even after returning there kishkinda
the monkey king has the authority to shower grace or give vent to his anger if we go without fulfilling the task we will face destruction
therefore think over well so that we do not fail ultimately you have a visionyou should suggest means by which this mission does not misfire
on listening to angadas words jambavan the bull among monkeys replied this way
o hero this work will not be balked i will now inspire one who can achieve this task
then jambavan observed the worries of several hundred thousands of the monkey army and said to hanuman
o hanuman you are the choicest one among many scholars wellversed in all sastras why do you sit alone why do you not speak
hanuman you are equal to the king of monkeys and also rama and lakshmana in brilliance and strength
you are the son of arishtanemi sage kasyapa and vinata and your gurulike elder brother is garuda the greatest among birds he is powerful and and famous
garuda is very powerful swift and famous i have seen him snatching serpents from the ocean many times
the strength of your shoulders is equal to that of his garudas wings your speed and valour are no less
o leader of the monkeys you are superior in strength wisdom brilliance and valour to all beings why do you not realise your own strength
o dear she was famous in the three worlds peerless in beauty and could change form at her free will she was born of a monkey on this land by dint of a curse
she was the daughter of a great king of monkeys called kunjara that young and beautiful lady had assumed a lustrous human form decked with wonderful garlands ornaments and silk clothes and was roving on top of the mountain which appeared like a proud raincloud
while the largeeyed lady was stationed on the mountain top the windgod gently let her auspicious yellow garment with red border fly away
then he windgod saw her curved wellset thighs her beautiful plump breasts and her lovely pleasing face
on seeing the broad hips slender waist and beautiful limbs of that famous lady the windgod was infatuated
the windgod lost his control over himself his whole being was overpowered by love for her beautiful flawless body he embraced her with his long arms
she was bewildered by this and being chaste and strict observer of chastiny she said who is it that has destroyed my monoandry
on hearing anjanas words the windgod replied o auspicious lady i do you no harm o lady of beautiful hips i reached enjoyed you in mind not body you need not fear
o renowned lady i have embraced you and united with you mentally enjoyed you without physical contactyou will bring forth a son endowed with great wisdom and courage
he will be very powerful illustrious and will be of great valour and strength he will be my equal in leaping and flying
o great monkey o strongshouldered one having been assured that way your mother was pleased and delivered you a bull among monkeys in a cave
on seeing the rising sun in the deep forest mistaking him to be a fruit you wanted to seize it when you were youngyou suddenly flew into the sky and went flying towards the sun
o great monkey you went three hundred yojanas and were pushed back by the suns radiance yet it did not leave you depressed
o great monkey while falling fast in space wise indra hurled his thunderbolt quickly at you in anger
you fell on the edge of the mountain peak and your left chin got broken since then you are widely known as hanuman one who has a wounded chin
the windgod who is a carrier of fragrance and breaker of trees became very angry on seeing the injury on you and stopped blowing in the three worlds
o dear when the windgod was pleased brahma gave a boon to you to appease his anger the boon made you truly valiant so that you cannot be struck by any weapon and killed
o lord observing that you are not hurt even when struck by the thunderbolt indra offered one of the best boons to you to choose to die only when you wish
you are a son of kesari endowed with terrific strength and a lawful son of maruta also you are therefore equal to the very windgod in flying and in brilliance
now we have almost lost our lifeyou are our saviour like another monkeyking like garuda king of birdsyou are fully endowed with valour and courage
o dear when visnu vamana incarnate took three strides i circumambulated the whole earth including its mountains and trees twentyone times
then on receiving orders from the gods we collected medicinal herbs and nectar which gave us great strength
i have become old and my valour is depleted at this time you are the sole resort for us you have all the necessary qualities
cheer up and advanceyou are the best among the creatures that can leapthe entire army of monkeys want to see your valour
o hanuman tiger among monkeys rise up and cross this great oceanyou have that supreme capacity among all beings
o hanuman all the monkeys look dejected why do you delay o warrior act quick with your rapid speed like trivikrama who took three strides that covered the entire universe
in order to cross a hundred yojanas hanuman the best of monkeys expanded his might and strength seeing him a warrior of great strength all the monkeys filled with enthusiasm at once gave up grief and collected togetherthey rejoiced and propitiated him screaming aloud
the monkeys collected together happily gazing at hanumanthey were wonderstruck to see hanuman in that huge form just as all beings were when they saw lord narayana in his incarnation of vamana
the monkeys praised the mighty hanuman as he grew in size whirling his tail around joyfully
as hanuman was being praised by the monkey leaders his body filled with lustre it looked excellent
just as a lion grown in a mountain cave stretches its body the windgods son stretched his limbs at that time
on expansion wise hanumans face was bright glowing like a burning oven and shining like smokeless fire
hanuman risen from the midst of the monkeys with his hair bristling on the body due to expansion of body saluted reverentially to the elderly monkey jambavan and said
the windgod is a friend of fire who is a powerful consumer of oblations his strength is immeasurable he wanders in the sky and shatters the mountain tops
i am the lawfulson of the swiftmoving windgod maruta comparable to him in leaping
i can with all enthusiasm go round the vast mount meru a thousand times without resting on it which is as though scratching the sky
i can submerge this world including its mountains rivers and lakes i can push back the sea waters quickly with my arms
thrust by my thighsthe ocean will rise up carrying with it the shanks and mighty crocodiles stunned by the force
i am capable of circumambulating a thousand times the great garuda who consumes snakes and flies in the sky the abode of birds
o bull among monkeys when the sun rises from behind the eastern mountain it is possible for me to start with him and go to the western horizon and return before the blazing sun with its beams of light sets it is also possible for me to descend to the earth with the same speed and return to the sun without touching the earth
if i rise up i can overtake all those creatures flying in the sky and from there i can stir up the ocean and tear up the earth easily
o monkeys when i leap i can crush the mountains into powder and pull the vast ocean with me with the force of my thighs
and then as i leap through the sky flowers of many kinds of creepers and trees will follow me
o monkey when i fly upward in the dreadful sky or descend down all creatures will see me for my path will be the path of the constellation of swati a group of stars
o monkeys when i fly in the sky like the great mount meru you will see me as if i am swallowing the sky because i will be enveloping it with my strides
only garuda and maruta have the capacity to fly like me no one other than the king of vultures and the windgod have the speed to fly like me
just as the lightning generated by the clouds lands at once flying in the sky without any support i can also land in less than a moment
o monkeys i have a feeling in my mind that i will see vaidehi be happy
i am equal to maruta and garuda in speed i feel i can cover ten thousand yojanas at a stretch
i think i can encounter indra wielder of the thunderbolt and obtain nectar from his hands i can even confront brahma the selfborn creator courageously i can even uproot lanka and carry it
the monkeys looked at him and were amazed happy to see him roaring and shining in brilliance
jambavan the finest of the monkeys felt very glad on hearing his words which put an end to the sorrow of the kith and kin and said
o son of kesari o son of maruta o hero you have removed the great grief of your race dear
by the blessings of the sages and by the grace of the elderly monkeys may you cross over the vast ocean
then the tiger among monkeys hanuman said to those forestdwellers monkeys the earth cannot bear the thrust of my leaping
the rocks on the peaks of the ranges of mount mahendra cannot with stand it although they are huge and firm
i will pick up speed on the peaks of mount mahendra filled with different kinds of trees and minerals
o great monkeys these mountain peaks can withstand the crushing force of my feet as i leap over a hundred yojanas
the son of maruta who was as eminent as the windgod the crusher of enemies ascended the great mountain mahendra full of grassland inhabited by deer thickly grown with various trees and creepers full of fragrant flowers and fruits where roam lions and tigers and proud elephants a place that echoes with sounds of intoxicated birds and waterfalls
the mighty preeminent monkey who was equal to indra in valour took a leap from the high peaks of the tall mountain mahendra
crushed by the feet of the great self hanuman the huge mountain looked like a proud elephant struck by a lion
the rocks of the mountain got scattered by the force the deer and elephants were terrified the trees were shaken up violently and streams of water gushed forth
shaken by the rude shock couples of intoxicated gandharvas left in a huff the vast slopes of the great mountain flocks of birds and groups of vidyadharas flew away the serpents went into hiding rocks fell off the shaken mountain
the serpents with their bodies half protruded out of the rocks and hissing looked like flags planted on the mountain
the alarmed and agitated sages abandonned the mountain peaksthe mountain appeared like a lone traveller separated from the caravan in the great forest
magnanimous wise and heroic hanuman destroyer of enemy warriors fixed his attention on speed betook himself mentally to lanka ere he reached it physically      thus ends the sixtyseventh sarga in kishkindakanda of the first epic the holy ramayana composed by sage valmiki
hanuman crusher of enemies resolved to find the whereabouts of sita carried away by ravana he followed the path of the charanas celestial bards
hanuman who raised his head and neck intending to cross the formidable ocean which none else could accomplish looked like a leading bull
tawnyhued hanuman gifted with extraordinary strength and patience happily strolled on the marshy tracts of grassy land which had the colour of vaidurya
wise hanuman went about like a lion scaring away birds uprooting trees with his chest and trampling many animals
the mountain was as though decorated with mineral rocks of varied colours like blue red yellow and green as well as black and whiteit was frequently visited by yakshas kinneras gandharvas and nagas surrounded by their retinue capable of assuming any form at their free will rivalling gods and nagas in splendour
as the monkey leader stood at the foot of the great mountain filled with lordly elephants he looked like an elephant standing at the centre of a pond
offering salutations with folded palms to the sungod to mahendra lord of the gods to the windgod to the creator brahma and to all the attendants of lord siva made up his mind to proceed to lanka
hanuman endowed with great equanimity facing the east and joining his palms by way of salutaion to the windgod his father he enlarged his size and turned south in order to depart
having made up his mind to leap for the cause of rama hanuman began to grow in size just as the sea grows during the fullmoon and newmoon days while the monkey troops were watching
having swollen to an immeasurable figure he pressed on the mountain with his feet and hands in an attempt to cross the ocean
pressed firmly by hanuman the mountain was shaken for a moment which caused the flowers to drop down from the tree tops
with heaps of flowers full of fragrance fallen down from the trees all over the mountain it looked as though it was a mountain of flowers
the mountain pressed hard under the feet of the valiant hanuman discharged streams of water just as an elephant in rut would exude water of intoxication
pressed by the powerful hanuman mount mahendra let out streams of the hue of gold and silver containing the ores of these minerals
the mountain threw down big boulders along with sulphur just like fire emits columns of smoke surrounded by flames
squeezed on all sides of the mountain by hanuman all creatures living in the caves shrieked making horrible sounds
due to the crushing of the mountain a loud noise of the various creatures shot up filling the earth in all directions and groves around
the snakes spread out their broad hoods manifesting swastika marks on them and bit the rocks with their fangs pouring out terrible fire
bitten by the venomous and angry snakes the mountain was broken into a thousand pieces by the blazing flames
even the medicinal herbs grown on the mountain could not neutralize the effect of the poison of snakes
even the ascetics left the place approaching that the mountain would be broken into pieces by creatures the alarmed vidyadharas leaped into the sky along with groups of their women leaving behind golden jugs of wine as well as precious utensils big and small sizes and golden goblets cups in the drinking place as well as many tasty eatables like licking food chewing food and many types of meat they also left bullhides and swords with golden sheaths
the intoxicated vidyadharas with eyes red like lotuses wearing garlands around the neck and smeared with red sandalpaste flew into the sky
adorned with necklaces anklets and armlets the vidyadharis stayed wonderstruck in the sky smiling gently in the company of their lovers
the seers among the vidyadharas proficient in different fields of knowledge were also watching the mountain from the sky along with others
then the vidyadharas heard the words of praiseof hanuman by the sages seekers of the ultimate truth the charanas and the siddhas who stood and watched in the clear sky
hanuman the son of the windgod who is like a mountain with extraordinary might intends to cross the ocean the abode of crocodiles
for the sake of rama and the vanaras he wants to reach the other shore of the ocean which is difficult and indeed impossible
the vidyadharas heard the sages speaking in that manner on the mountain they beheld hanuman the bull among vanaras whose strength was beyond measure
hanuman huge as a mountain moved his body and shook the hair on his body thundering like a cloud
like the king of birds garuda would shake a serpent he shook his tail covered with hair in order to take off
hanuman had the tail curled at his back which appeared like a big serpent being carried off by garuda
the monkey fixed his arms looking like iron clubs firmly on the mountain and crouched his waist and contracted his feet
the glorious and courageous hanuman his head and shoulders contracted summoned up all his energy and vigour
having cast his eyes upward in order to view the distance and direction in which he had to leap he restrained his breath in the chest while looking at the sky
a mighty elephant among vanaras hanuman holding his feet firmly and standing in that position contracted his ears and addressed the monkeys when he was about to leap
just like an arrow released by raghava would fly i too will proceed with the speed of the wind to reach lanka ruled by ravana
if i am not able to find the daughter of janaka at lanka i will go to heaven abode of the gods with the same speed
if i do not find sita in heaven in spite of my efforts i will bind that king of demons ravana and bring him here
i will by all means return successful with sita or else i will uproot lanka along with ravana and bring him here
having thus addressed the monkeys the foremost of vanarashanuman endowed with great speed leaped without any exertion the elephant among monkeys felt like garuda
when he took off numerous trees on the mountain drawing together the branches all over flew along with him
he swept away the lapwings in heat on the blossoms of the trees by the speed of his thighs while he coursed through the cloudless sky
swept away by the force of his thighs the trees bent forward following him for a while just as relatives accompany their kith and kin on long travel
uprooted by the force of hanumans thighsgreat trees like sala followed him just like the troops follow the king
with numerous trees laden with flowers following him hanuman who looked like a mountain presented a queer spectable
then the huge trees sank into the ocean of salt water even as mountains did afraid of indras thunderbolt
covered with tender sprouts and buds of different kinds of flowers hanuman shone brightly like a flying mountain with fireflies
shedding their blossoms under his thrust the trees dropped into the waters of the sea just like close relatives follow at the time of farewell
driven by the wind caused by hanumans speed a variety of flowers fell into the ocean because of their light weight and the ocean looked colourful and bright like the starspangled sky
covered with blossoms of different kinds and colours hanuman looked like a cloud brightened by lightnings in the sky
the seawater looked splendid with flowers dropped by dint of his speed it resembled the firmament spangled with enchanting stars just risen in the sky
that great vanara appeared as if he was gulping the entire ocean with its rising waves while he was looking upward it appeared as though he was keen to drink in the sea as well
while he was looking upward that great vanara appeared as if parched with thirst he was gulping the entire ocean with its rising waves
as he was moving in the sky following the direction of the wind his eyes blazed like two fires burning on the mountain flashing like lightning
the large round reddishbrown eyes of hanuman shed their bright light like the rising moon and sun
by the reflection of his copperyred nose his face looked red like the suns orb coming close at twilight
as the son of the windgod was flying through the sky his coiled up tail looked splendid like the banner installed at the festival in honour of indra on the fifteenth day of the month of bhadrapada
with his white teeth and curled up tail the wise son of the windgod looked splendid like the halo of the sungod
the great monkey with copperred buttocks other parts being dark looked splendid like a cleft mountain with a huge deposit of minerals shining red
the wind passing through the arm pits of the lionlike vanara crossing the ocean sounded like a thundering cloud
the elephantlike monkey was seen darting across the oceangoing from north to south like a meteor risen in the north along with its tailend falling down the sky
the vanara expanded into an enormous size form appeared as though moving like the setting sun he looked like a huge elephant bound round the waist
when the vanara was flying in the sky his shadow reflected in the ocean looked like a ship driven by the wind and sailing on the sea below as if the lower part of his body was under water and upper part occupied the sky
whichever part of the sea over which that monkey flew it appeared as though it was riotous with eddies whirlpools and revolving foam etc stirred up by the speed of his thighs
as the great vanara was flying swiftly the oceanic waves in rows dashing against his chest rose as high as the mountain
the forceful wind generated by the monkey moving swiftly and by the clouds agitated the ocean violently creating dreadful sounds
as the tiger among the monkeys pushed the big network of waves of the saltwater ocean and leaped forward it appeared as if he was drawing the intermediary space dividing the earth and the sky
hanuman moving along in high speed looked as if he was counting the mighty waves risen ike meru and mandara mountains
then the water raised by his onrush along with the cloud widely spread in the sky shone like an outstreched autumnal cloud
on account of the seawater rising up the whales crocodiles fish and tortoises laid bare like the limbs of the body disrobed
seeing hanuman the tiger among vanaras coursing through the sky the serpents in their seaabode mistook him for garuda
the shadow of hanuman the lion among monkeys thirty yojanas long and ten yojanas in breadth appeared more pleasing
the broad shadow of the son of the windgod in the sea following him shone like a dark row of clouds sailing in the pristine sky
hanuman the great vanara splendid with a huge body coursing through the air seemed like a winged mountain flying the sky without any support
as the powerful monkey an elephant among vanaras was proceeding swiftly along the ocean got instantly transformed into a trough on account of water swelling by the force of his flight
hanuman was found pulling clusters of big clouds along with him like the windgod and appeared like garudathe king of birds drawing flocks of birds along with him at the time of landing
while hanuman was drawing big clouds which were either white or red or blue or yellow he looked charming
entering into and emerging from the clouds he looked like the moon that appears and disappears behind a bank of clouds
then seeing hanuman crossing quickly the gods gandharvas and demons rained flowers on him
the sun spared hanuman from the heat and even the windgod served him blowing cool while he was taking leaps in order to fulfil ramas mission
the sages praised him while he was coursing through the sky the gods and gandharvas sang in praise of him extolling his majesty and vigour
observing the unwearied monkey the nagas yakshas the demons protecting the southwest the learned sages and birds praised him
while the monkeychief was leaping across the sea the seagod wished the wellbeing of the ikshvaku family and honoured him the seagod belonged to the same race
if i fail to help the monkeychief the wise will blame me
i expanded on account of a scion of the ikshvaku race sagara and i should not do anything to make him hanuman suffer since he is the minister helping the ikshvaku race
i will have to make arrangements for his rest later he can resume his journey comfortably
having resolved in his mind the seagod addressed the noble golden mount mainaka hidden in the sea
o foremost mountain you are kept here by indra lord of the gods as a barrier against the intrusion of demons residing in the netherworld
you are staying at the entrance preventing the violent demons of the immeasurable nether world from jumping onto the surface
o noble mountain you have the capacity to grow across upward and downward by your free will i therefore prompt you to grow
valiant hanuman a tiger among monkeys and a performer of dreadful deeds is flying over you to fulfil ramas mission
i should help him for he is working for the welfare of the ikshavaku family the ikshvaku kings are worthy of adoration to me and for you as well
you may act as our minister and let us not miss this chance pious men lose their cool if a worthy act is left unfulfilled
rise up from the waters let him rest on you since this noble monkey is our guest and worthy of worship
o goldenpeaked mountainyou are the refuge of the gods and gandharvas let him also rest on you for a while before he negotiates the remaining part of the journey
you ought to rise up if you consider the nobility of the scion of the kakusthas the deportation of mythili and the exertion put forth by hanuman the lord of monkeys
hearing the command of the god of the ocean mount mainaka rich in gold and covered with trees and creepers rose up at once from the water
just as the rising sun comes out with glowing rays tearing the veil of dark clouds the mountain rose up from the water of the ocean
at the instance of varuna the presiding deity of the ocean the lofty mountain appeared projecting its peaks hitherto submerged in the water the golden peaks inhabited by nagas and kinnaras resemmbled the rising sun as though scraping the sky in a moment
the sky shone like barnished weapons smeared with the golden colour of the mountain peaks that rose up above the water
the noble mountain mainaka was glittering like a thousand suns with selfeffulgent golden peaks shining
hanuman considered the mountain rising up in the midst of the ocean and standing in front an impediment
the great vanarawho was swift in action felled down the mountain that had risen high instantly with his chest just as the wind would strike a cloud
felled by the vanaras speed the tall mountain overwhelmed with joy roared in high pitch
now the mountain assumed a human form and standing on its own summit which stood very high and glad at heart addressed the heroic vanara gone to the aerial region
o best of vanaras you have achieved a formidable deed alighting on my peak and comfortably resting awhile you may resume your journey
the son of ramas family sagara has extended the ocean in the pastit is most appropriate that he the god of the sea honours you in return as you have set out in the service of rama
i was prompted by the ocean for your sake since he has great regard for you o great monkey you may rest here for a while and continue your journey the lord of the ocean feels that this tiger among monkeys can cover the distance of a hundred yojanas he tells me let him rest on your peak and then cover the rest of the distance
o foremost of the monkeys after eating plenty of sweet and tasty roots and fruits and resting a while you may go
o chief of monkeys indeed we too have a relationship with you based on merit which is wellknown to all the three worlds
o son of the windgod you are an elephant among monkeys the foremost among them who move at a high speed
even a newcomer however ordinary deserves worship by a wise man who wishes to educate himself in the path of righteousness needless to say that distinguished guest like you deserves all reverence
o foremost among the vanaras you are the son of the highsouled windgods preeminent among the gods you are also equal to him in speed
o knower of righteousness to worship you is to honour the windgod therefore you are worthy of worship for me i will tell you the reason listen
formerly in kritayuga o dear mountains were endowed with wings they used to move speedily in all directions like garuda and the windgod
when they moved about even hosts of sages gods and creatures panicked for fear of falling down and destroying all worlds
provoked at this the thousandeyed indra who had performed a hundred sacrifices cut off the wings of mountains into a thousands pieces with his thunderbolt
o distinguished vanara your father the windgod threw me down into this saltwater sea thus my wings were protected
o esteemed vanara the windgod is revered by me and so i honour you o chief of monkeys my bondage with you is therefore of high value to me indeed
o great monkey when i hold you so high you ought to oblige me and the god of the ocean wholeheartedly and accept our hospitalty
o noble monkey oblige us by accepting our offering given with love and be relieved of your fatigue your presence itself is welcome to me
the great hanuman pleased with the words of mainaka said i am pleased at your hospitality remove your unhappiness
my commitment is hastening me the day set for the accomplishment of the task is also drawing to a close a vow is made and i will not halt in the middle of my work
having said this the mighty monkey gently touched the mountain with his hands before ascending to the sky with a smile on his face
the mountain and the sea honoured and adored the son of the windgod and gave him appropriate blessings
and thereafter leaping a long distance into the clear sky he hanuman took the path of the windgod his father leaving behind the mountain and the sea
rising higher and further up and looking at the mountain which was going down into the ocean the son of the windgod coursed through the cloudless sky unsupported
gods siddhas as well as the great sages praised him for the second great achievment of hanuman which is impossible for others to accomplish
the gods who happened to be present at that time on the mountain and the thousandeyed indra were delighted by the gesture of golden sunabha mainaka mountain
indra the lord of sachi was personally satisfied and spoke to mainaka the best of mountains in faltering tone his throat choked out of joy
o hiranyanabha the foremost among the mountains i am highly pleased with you i give you security free from fear of losing wings o pious one you may stay on happily as you please
you have rendered very valuable help to hanuman who was attempting to leap a distance of a hundred yojanas he is fearless even when there is reason to fear of falling down
the vanara has gone on a mission to help the son of dasaratha i am highly pleased with the service rendered to him
thereafter mainaka the great mountain was delighted to see indra lord of the gods performer of a hundred yajnas satisfied
then mount mainaka assured by indra became secure and hanuman also crossed over the ocean in a short while
then the gods gandharvas siddhas and great sages approached surasa the mother of nagas who was glowing like the sungod and said
the glorious son of the windgod called hanuman is crossing the ocean obstruct him for sometime by assuming the hideous form of a demon gigantic as a mountain fearful with yellowishbrown eyes with big teeth and a wide mouth like the sky
we want to assess his strength valour and intelligence once again we wish to know whether he will win or give way to despondency
thus honoured by the gods surasa assumed a terrific ugly form frightening to all and stood in the midst of the ocean putting up a distorted appearance and encompassing hanuman who was crossing the ocean she spoke to him
o bull among vanaras the lords of the universe have provided you as food for me i will eat you enter my mouth
thus addressed by surasa the glorious hanuman said this with a blooming face and folded hands
dasarathas son called rama accompanied by his brother lakshmana and his wife vaidehi entered dandaka forest
while rama was engaged otherwise his glorious wife sita was abducted by ravana actuated by deeprooted enmity of demons with him
i am going as ramas emissary to search for his wife it is proper for you to render help since you are a resident of his kingdom
having heard hanuman surasa capable of taking any form at her free will told him that no one can cross her region as she had been given such a boonby the creator
surasa mother of serpents observing that hanuman was attempting to escape said this in order to gauge his strength
o best vanara you must pass through my mouth today such is the boon granted to me by brahma in the past then she quickly opened her big mouth and stood
thus addressed by surasa hanuman the supreme vanara said open your mouth wide enough to hold me
provoked by the words of surasa hanuman stretched himself to ten yojanas
seeing his body stretched to ten yojanas like a cloud surasa also widened her mouth to twenty yojanas
provoked hanuman further stretched his body to thirty yojanas and surasa on her own enlarged her mouth to forty yojanas then the great hero hanuman stretched his body to fifty yojanas
surasa widened her mouth sixty yojanas and then the heroic hanuman enlarged himself to seventy yojanas
surasa widened her mouth to eighy yojanas and the heroic hanuman grew up to ninety yojanas looking like a mountain
intelligent hanuman observing surasas enlarged mouth open and dreadful like hell with a long tongue suddenly shrunk his body to the size of a thumb
glorious and mighty hanuman quickly went into her mouth and got out and stood in the sky and said
o dakshayani i have indeed entered your mouth and your boon has come true as nobody can go against the boon of the creator allow me to proceed in quest of vaidhehi my salutations to you
seeing hanuman released out of her mouth like the moon released from the mouth of rahu surasa assumed her true form and said
o noble vanara proceed happily to achieve your purpose go and unite vaidehi with the noble self raghava
witnessing hanuman achieving a very difficult feat for the third time all the living beings applauded him saying well done welldone
rising above the invincible ocean the abode of lord varuna hanuman coursed through the sky speedily like garuda
hanuman passed through the path of wind like garuda the region was refreshed with clouds that released torrents of rain and frequented by birds the great masters of music tumburu narada and gandharvas trained in kasika moved there driven by lions elephants tigers birds and serpents and were moving in different aerial vehicles it was splendid with god at fire who strikes fiercely like thunderbolt it was inhabited by great sages who had acquired merit the region was traversed by firegod who carried havis in large quantities earnestly it was decorated with planets constellations moon sun and clusters of stars it was filled with groups of greal sages gandharvas nagas and yakshas it was isolated part of the universe traversed by the king of gandharvas like vishvavasu it was an auspicious path for moon and sun a sporting ground for airavata the vehicle of lord indra it was an extensive world of living beings created by brahma it was frequented by many heroes ascending to heaven and blocked by vidyadharas
hanuman passed through the path of wind like garuda the region was refreshed with clouds that released torrents of rain and frequented by birds the great masters of music tumburu narada and gandharvas trained in kasika moved there driven by lions elephants tigers birds and serpents and were moving in different aerial vehicles it was splendid with god at fire who strikes fiercely like thunderbolt it was inhabited by great sages who had acquired merit the region was traversed by firegod who carried havis in large quantities earnestly it was decorated with planets constellations moon sun and clusters of stars it was filled with groups of greal sages gandharvas nagas and yakshas it was isolated part of the universe traversed by the king of gandharvas like vishvavasu it was an auspicious path for moon and sun a sporting ground for airavata the vehicle of lord indra it was an extensive world of living beings created by brahma it was frequented by many heroes ascending to heaven and blocked by vidyadharas
hanuman son of the windgod was seen everywhere in the sky he appeared like a longwinged king of mountains unsupported
seeing hanuman speeding in the sky a demoness called simhika who can assume any form at her will had grown out of proportion and thought on her part
thinking thus she dragged him by his shadow before she took hold of him hanuman started deliberating within
i am caught suddenly i am handicappedi am like a huge ship in an ocean retarded by the wind blowing from the opposite direction
looking around right and left up and down the monkey saw a huge being rise from the salty sea
seeing the form with a hideous countenance hanuman reflected about the creature of ugly appearance endowed with power which can catch a creature though his shadow about which king sugriva had once told him it is the same creature no doubt said hanuman
recognising the true nature of simhika the clutcher of shadows the wise hanuman grew to a huge size like a cloud in rainy season
observing the body of hanuman growing in size simhika started distending her mouth wide like the depth of the underworld
roaring like a heavy mass of clouds simhika chased hanuman intelligent hanuman observed her enormous mouth and noticed her vital parts
hanuman the vanara whose physique was as hard as thunderbolt suddenly contracted once again and entered her opened mouth
the siddhas and charanas who were watching his performance of drowning in her mouth were amazed as though the moon is seized by rahu on a fullmoon night
the vanara who had the speed of mind tore her vital parts with his sharp nails and rushed out quickly before she closed her mouth
selfcontrolled hanuman the great monkey acting with firmness of mind and ingenuity threw her down and once again rapidly grew in size
heart torn asunder and killed by hanuman miserable simhika instantly fell into the sea water observing it the beings who ranged the sky said to the foremost of vanaras
o great jumper a great deed has been done by you today in killing that fierce creature o great monkey fulfil your mission without any obstruction
o lord of vanaras he in whom these four qualities fortitude vision intelligence and dexterity exist as in you will achieve his mission and not get lost
honoured by them the venerable monkey went ascending into the sky like garuda to achieve the objective
on reaching the other side of the shore crossing a hundred yojanas he saw rows of forest trees
hanuman the best among jumpers even while in air he saw an island adorned with many trees also gardens adjacent to malaya mountain
the mighty hanuman crossed the inviolable sea stood comfortably on the peak of trikuta mountain and looked at lanka
covered fully with the continuous shower of flowers dropped on him from the trees heroic hanuman appeared as though he was a heap of flowers as he stood there
the glorious powerful vanara hanuman even after crossing a hundred yojanas felt neither suffocated nor exasperated
he said to himself i can cross a distance of even hundreds of yojanas what to say of a hundred yojanas which is a calculated distance
courageous and exalted hanuman the best among vanaras noted for his speed reached lanka crossing over the great ocean on his own
hanuman passed through forests laden with fragrant flowers bluish grassy land big rocks and mountains covered with trees
brilliant hanuman a bull among monkeys crossed the mountains covered with blossoming trees and forest ranges
that son of the windgod stood on the mountain and saw the forests and groves round lanka situated on the mountain peak
the mighty vanara saw around lanka trees like sarala karnikara in full bloom datepalms priyala muchulinda kutaja kethaka trees filled with fragrance priyangu kadamba so also flowering plants like saptachhada asana kovidara and karaveera fully loaded with flowers and buds these trees were thronged by birds with their branches shaken by the wind flocks of swans and waterfowls were found in ponds of different types there were various pleasure groves with flowers in bloom and fruits of all seasons and varieties of water resorts and delightful gardens
fortunate hanuman having reached lanka ruled by ravana found it surrounded by moats full of blue lotuses guarded by demons with frightening bows in view of sita abducted and kept there it was protected by boundary walls inlaid with gold that great and beautiful city with buildings resembling the assembly of planets and whitewashed elevated houses looking like autumnal clouds and well laid out streets decorated with garlands of banners and flag posts rows of colourful creepers and festoons the city of lanka appeared like amaravati the city of gods
the foremost among the vanaras perched on top of the mountain saw the city of lanka on the mountain with auspicious mansions as though touching the sky
the city of lanka ruled by the lord of demons and built by visvakarma looked as if it was a city floating in the sky
having reached the northern entrance of the city he started thinking that visvakarma must have conceived lanka as a lady with its ramparts as her hips and loins moats filled with water as her robes the spiked iron tridents as her locks of hair and the tall towers as her her ear rings
observing lanka that resembled mount kailas with sky scrapers appearing as if flying filled with dreadful demons and nagas protecting the city of bhogavati the city of patala unimaginably wellbuilt it was once occupied by kubera half brother of ravana it was guarded by horrible demons holding tridents and spears in their hands the city appeared like a cavern protected by venomous serpents with protruding fangs hanuman examined the high security of lanka and looked at the ocean he thought of the form of ravana a formidable enemy
it is not possible for monkeys to come here and even if they do it is no use lanka is invincible even to the gods in war
what will rama the mighty armed hero do even after reaching this formidable city of lanka ruled by ravana
there is no scope for reconciliation with the demons it is not possible to win over them with gifts they cannot be divided by dissension there is no scope for war
only four great monkeys can have access to this place they are angada the son of vali nila sugriva the wise king of monkeys and myself
whether janakas daughter vaidehi is alive or not is not known after seeing her i shall think over
standing on the mountain the elephant among monkeys pondered for a while on the means of finding sita in which lay the welfare of rama
i shall not be able in my present form to enter the city guarded by fierce and powerful demons
to accomplish this great task i will have to assume an inconspicious form and enter the city of lanka in the night as that is the appropriate time
looking at the city unassailable even to gods and demons hanuman sighed again and again thinking
by what means can i find mythili daughter of janaka without being noticed by the evilminded ravana the lord of demons
how can the purpose of rama a noble soul be not spoilt i may have a private audience with the daughter of janaka
just as darkness disappears at sunrise wellplanned strategies also fail at the hands of a thoughtless messenger when they are set in opposition to proper time and place
even though messengers are not intelligent they think themselves clever and capable they act foolishly swerve from proper course of action and fail in their effort
how should the task be performed how to avoid impetuousness how can my purpose of crossing the ocean be not wasted
if i am seen by the demons the plan of rama possessor of selfknowledge to kill ravana will be wasted
it is difficult to stay with the demon anywhere here even in the disguise of a demon without being identified it will not be possible to remain unidentified even by assuming any other form
i think even the wind who has no form cannot move here without being detected nothing escapes the notice of powerful demons there is nothing unknown to them
i will surely meet with death if i hide here in my original form and my masters mission also will be spoilt
therefore i shall transform myself into a tiny form and jump about the city of lanka during night time in order to accomplish raghavas purpose
entering by night the inaccessible city of ravana i shall search all over the palace and find sita
having planned in that manner the heroic hanuman keen to see sita waited for the sunset
when sun set maruti the son of the windgod reduced himself at night to the small size of a cat wonderful to behold
as soon as dusk had set in courageous hanuman jumped in and entered the well laidout royal path of the beautiful city
hanuman saw the city stretched with rows of buildings all overwith seven or eight storied mansions which had pillars of gold and silver windows with fretwork of gold inlaid with crystals floors decorated with gold resembling the grand city of gandharvas
inlaid with precious gems and fretwork and ornamented with pearls the mansions of demons looked splendid
the golden archways of the demon were colourful they illuminated the well decorated lanka from all sides
beholding lanka of unimaginable wonderful glory the great monkey keen to see sita became sad as well as elated at once he did not know how to find sita in that city and felt sad but he was also elated that he was going to meet her at any cost
he found that famed place with a garland of tall white mansions conspicuous with archways latticed with gold strings protected by mighty ravana and surrounded by terrific demons
even the moon rose with thousands of rays in the centre of multitudes of stars overspreading and illumining the world with a canopy of bright beams as if to render ministerial help to hanuman
the heroic vanara saw the rising moon flitting in and out shining like a fresh white conch in the colour of milk and lotus stalks bright like a swan floating in the lakelike sky      thus ends the second sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
the mighty son of the windgod intelligent hanuman an elephant among vanaras standing on the peak of the lamba which looked like a high rainbearing cloud and relying on his energy entered by night the city of lanka ruled by ravana rich in delightful forests groves and water pools
hanuman happy to reach lanka stood on its rampart and surveyed the city of land which was splendid with beautiful mansions overcast with autumnal clouds pierced by glittering streaks of lightning served by planets and stars with mild winds blowing out of fear of ravana with the roaring sounds of the sea and with a wellfed army like vitapavati that is alaka the capital of kubera halfbrother of ravana and the treasurer of celestials which had elephants sationed at the outer gates provided with white archways and protected by serpents like the auspicious city of bhogavati capital of patala surrounded by a golden rampart the city resembled amaravati the capital of indra decorated with flags fluttering echoing with the jingling sounds of small bells
surveying all over hanuman was wonderstruck to see as though it was leaping into the sky the city had golden shutters altars encrusted with vaidurya mansions inlaid with diamonds crystals pearls and other gems crowned with pure gold and silver the staircases built with silver were studded with vaidurya the beautiful quadrangles coverd with grains of crystal were as though leaping into the air it echoed with sounds of krauncha birds peacocks and royal swans filled with sounds of musical instruments it resembled the city of vaswokasara
gazing at the enchanting auspicious prosperous city of the king of demons mighty hanuman began to reflect
it is not possible to attack this city by to outsiders as it is protected by the forces of ravana with their weapons readyto attack
this land can be reached by kumuda and angada or the great vanara sushena and even by mainda and dvivida
son of vivaswan sugriva the chief of vanaras kushaparva riksha jambavan and myself also will be able to reach this place
reflecting upon the valour of longarmed rama and valiant advances of lakshmana hamuman felt pleased within himself
hanuman looked at the city of the demon king whose darkness was dispelled by bright gems and mighty mansions as if it were a young maiden the prosperous city was like a well decorated woman adorned with ornaments having walls for her dress the stables for her earrings the armouries for her breasts
assuming her real form the presiding deity of lanka noticed the son of the windgod the tiger among vanaras of great prowess entering the city
seeing the best of vanaras the deity of the city of lanka ruled by ravana rose up before him in a distorted form
she stood in front of the son of the windgod and spoke to him in a loud voice
o dweller of the forest who are you why did you come here speak the truth about your identity so long as you hold on to your life
o vanara this lanka is a secret place protected by ravanas army everywhere it is surely not possible for you to enter this city
then hanuman who was standing in front of her said i will tell you the truth since you are asking me
who are you terrible woman of ugly distorted eyes why are you obstructing me at the gate of the city why do you impound upon me
the spirit of lanka who could assume any form at her will got enraged on hearing the words of hanuman and spake in a harsh tone
in obedience to the orders of the great demon king ravana i am protecting this unassailable city
it is not possible for you to enter this city ignoring my presence soon you will be killed you will give up your life and attain eternal sleep
o monkey i am the presiding ogress of lanka presenting myself personally i am to protect this city this is my answer to you
on hearing the words of ogress of lanka the son of the windgod stood up ready and appeared like another mountain
seeing the monster of a woman the powerful hanuman bull among vanaras endowed with wisdom spoke to her
i would like to see this lanka with marketplaces gateways and ramparts i have come here for that purpose my curiosity has been roused to see this place
i have arrived here to see lankas gardens groves and forests and also all the important houses
on hearing hanuman the ogress of lanka who could assume any form replied in harsh words
o evilminded foolish monkey it is not possible for you to enter the city ruled by ravana the king of demons without conquering me
the tiger among monkeys said to the the nightwalker o noble lanka i shall see this city and go back
then the ogress of lanka made a loud and frightening sound and struck the most powerful vanara with the palm of her hand
at this strong slap the heroic hanuman son of the windgod roared loudly
overcome by anger hanuman clenched the fingers of his left hand and hit her with his fist considering her to be after all a woman he did not turn outrageous
struck by the blow of hanuman the demoness fell down on the ground at once her limbs shattered her face distorted
wise and brilliant hanuman seeing the deity fallen down left her without killing her out of compassion thinking that she is a woman after all
thereafter the deflated demoness of lanka with an agitated voice said to hanuman the monkeyhero
o strongshouldered great monkey be gracious save me heroes endowed with great strength stay back when the time comes
o monkey i am lanka incarnate you have conquered me by your strength and valour
o lord of vanaras in the past creator brahma had given me a boon which has come true i will tell you listen
when a vanara vanquishes you by his prowess you may know that destruction of ogres will set in
o gentle one the time ordained by brahma has come today with your presence here the truth revealed by brahma the selfborn cannot be proved otherwise
the ruin of all demons and evilminded king ravana will take place due to the abduction of sita
o great vanara enter the city ruled by ravana and accomplish your purpose
o lord of vanaras you may search for the chaste lady daughter of king janaka all over freely entering this doomed city ruled by the chief of demons     thus ends the third sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
hanuman the strongshouldered mighty monkey chief having defeated the presiding deity of lanka who could assume any form at her will leaped over the boundary wall of the rear entrance of the excellent city by his prowess
hanuman a devotee of the king of monkeys entered the city of lanka placing his left foot first on the forehead of the city and proceeded by tradition one enters the enemys dwelling by placing the left foot first to cause defeat of the enemy
the son of the windgod endowed with great strength entered the enchanting lanka and walked along the highway set with flowers of pearls
the houses reverberating with sounds of laughter and of musical instruments decorated with lattice windows of diamonds resembled the sky shining with clouds with a goad made of diamond thunderbolt of indra
the city of lanka appeared radiant with its tall mansions resembling white clouds the mansions had auspicious marks of lotus and swastika engraved on them and were opening in the direction of the south
glorious hanuman wellwisher of sugriva king of vanaras looked around the city decorated with colourful garlands surveying it for the cause of raghava he was greatly delighted
going from one building to another hanuman saw mansions of different kinds structures
he heard melodious songs of intoxicated women set to tune in three places namely chest throat and head and three pitches known as mandra slow madhya medium and tara high the songs resembled those of the apsarasas well set in musical notes set to music
great hanuman heard the jingling sounds of waist bells and anklets of women and sounds of great men climbing up and down flights of steps sounds of clapping and joking everywhere in the mansions
he heard chantings of sacred verses in the houses of demons engaged in the study of the vedas and heard demons singing loudly the eulogy of ravana
he observed large contingents of demons lining the highway and spies of ravana stationed in the middle of the city
going around lanka hanuman witnessed all kinds of demons priests who were performing rituals ascetics with matted hair some with shaven heads and some robed in cowhides some were holding fistfuls of darbha grass as weapons others held sacrificial tools as weapons some had mallets some hammers and others had staff and spikes some looked frightful with a single eye some with a single ear some with drooping stomachs and sagging breasts and in distorted forms similarly some dwarfs and some wielding iron weapons their bodies covered with wonderful shields some not very tall or short not stout or thin not very dark and not with hideous forms or mutilated bodies some had goodlooking countenances some were seen holding posts and flags and weapons of several kinds
the great monkey saw the demons who held shaktis and trees as weapons shakti is a lance some held threepointed spears missiles and slings with which missiles are hurled some of them wore flower garlands smeared unguents on their body and were bedecked with choicest ornaments they were dressed in several ways and many of them moved freely they were very strong and held sharp tridents and armed with thunderboltlike weapons
hanuman saw in front of the harem one hundred thousand strong vigilant soldiers of a middle rank ordered by the lord of demons
the great monkey observed the huge archway of the demon kings palace made of gold situated on top of the mountain as if scraping the sky circled by moats full of white lotuses appearing as though the moats were decorated with earornaments the whole city was encircled by a boundary wall
and then the great vanara entered the wonderful mansion that resembled heaven it was resonating with pleasing sounds of jingling ornaments made more noisy by the neighing of the horses there were carriages chariots flying chariots horses and elephants the beautiful entrance was looking splendid with intoxicated animals and birds that place looked splendid with fourtusked elephants resembling heaps of white clouds the beautiful entrance was guarded by thousands of valiant demons
hanuman entered the harem of ravana surrounded by walls of gold inlaid with precious pearls and other gems and sprinkled with excellent black agaru and sandal water     thus ends the fourth sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
then intelligent hanuman observed the moon in the central part of the sky spreading a canopy of his luminescence like the sun and looking like an intoxicated mighty white bull moving in a stable
while moving forward hanuman saw the moon spreading his light thereby warding off the agony of all creatures causing the swelling of the ocean and illuminating the earth as well as the sky
the same splendour on the mandara mountain on earth which glows at dusk lay on the ocean is there on lotuses in the lakes and on the beautiful moon also
like a swan in a cage of silver like a lion in a cave of mandara mountain like a hero on a proud intoxicated elephant the moon shone in the sky
the fullmoon with its hornlike spot shone like a bull with sharp horns like the white himalayan mountain with its lofty peaks and like an elephant with gold plated tusks
with the sun the great planet star destroying the frost that forms the dew the moon with its stain shone with graceful radiance
the moon shone bright like a lion mounted on a rock like a lordly elephant in a deep forest like a king on attaining the kingdom
at the time of moonrise the darkness of dusk is dispelled the dark deeds of cannibals disappear the natural instinct for love returns to women as the radiance of the moon spreads everywhere like in heaven
pleasing sounds of string instruments had begun to be heard chaste women were found asleep with their husbandsthe nightrangers had begun their strange evil and cruel deeds exhibiting their anger
intelligent hanuman the great warrior observed there in the prosperous mansions demons proud of their wealth highly intoxicated and dull their houses full of horsedrawn chariots with comfortable seats
the intoxicated demons were quarrelling ridiculing one another bitterly and wildly throwing their stout arms on one another indulging in incoherent talk uttering vulgar words
the demons were seen expanding their chests sportively and caressing their wives by placing their limbs on them they were assuming wonderful forms and drawing their bows up to their ears
he even saw women collected there their limbs smeared with unguents on their bodies like wise women with beautiful countenances laughing at others some sleeping and others hissing sighing like angry serpents
there were huge elephants trumpeting respected people warriors sighing for the lack of enemies to vanquish it had a lake infested with hissing snakes
he saw there in the city of lanka demons who were intellectuals pleasing in words with faith in religion preeminent heroes of the world of different kinds followers of good practices and with lovely names
he rejoiced to see the handsome demons radiant with forms commensurate with their virtues he also saw some ugly figures their traits in conformity to their forms
there he saw demonesses adorned with choicest ornaments their minds attached faithfully to their husbands and bottles of wine some of the wives of the demons however looked gentle and bright like stars
there he saw cheerful demonesses shining brightly abashed by the embrace of their beloveds during the night he also saw those sporting with their beloveds freely and looking like birds embracing flowers
intelligent hanuman saw demonesses seated happily on the laps of their beloved ones on the terraces of the mansions exhibiting their attachment to one another overwhelmed with sexual pleasure
ogresses without veil some altruistic some separated from their husbands looked pale like the moon though possessed of polished gold complexion
that heroic monkey saw ogresses delighted in the happy company of their loved ones who have joined them ecstatic wives in the houses
he saw rows of faces of shedemons shining like moonlight with sidelong glances and graceful eyelashes wearing ornaments resembling charmimg flashes of lightning
hanuman could not find sita anywhere an excellent lady born in a noble royal family adopting the right path a lady delicate like a blossoming creeper of good breed or so he imagined
sita must have had a pair of beautiful eyes she must have been a passionate lady with mind fixed on her glorious husband ever established in dharma she is perhaps a distinguished lady compared to her counterparts in lanka
she whose neck was adorned with costly ornaments earlier must be shedding hot tears now her throat choked with grief with her beautiful eyelashes and a sweet loving voice she would be now like a peahen wandering in the woods
she would be like a barely visible ray of the moon like a streak of gold covered with dust like an unhealed scar of a wound caused by an arrow only superficially covered and like a flake of cloud swept off by the wind
hanuman stood griefstricken having unsuccessfully searched for a long time for the wife of rama the lord of men the highly eloquent was now despondent for a while he looked dull and dejected     thus ends the fifth sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
the mighty hanuman who could assume any form at will not finding sita in the tall mansions again started rapidly ranging in lanka
then he reached the residence of the lord of demons enclosed by a red colour compound wall dazzling like the midday sun
the elephant among vanaras hanuman scanned the mansion defended by dreadful demons like a forest protected by lions
he saw beautiful silver archways decorated with gold colourful inner apartments with beauteous entrances
he saw archways guarded by riders mounted on majestic elephants and unwearied riders of chariots drawn by horses of irresistible speed kept ready
there were wonderful chariots covered with skins of lions and tigers encrusted with ivory gold and silver with ringing bells moving about
the palace was embellished with excellent seats and vessels with many precious gems there were spacious places to accommodate big chariorts filled with shouts of great charioteers
it was pleasing with several kinds of beautiful beasts in their thousands all over
the place was full of beautful women carefully protected by disciplined guards as well as demons
full of the jewels of joyous women the residence of the lord of demons reverberated with the jingling of their ornaments and accessories like the sound of the sea
the place was full of eminent demons with royal traits like a dense forest infested with lions it carried the fragrance of agaru and sandal of good quality
reverberating with the sounds of trumpets mridangam and conches there the demons daily performed worships and sacrifices on new and fullmoon days
the place produced deep sounds like the sea those mighty ogres wore gemstudded ornaments the great vanara saw the residence of the great self ravana rich with precious gems
hanuman the great monkey saw the royal mansion looking brilliant with elephants horses and chariots he thought that the palace was the very ornament of lanka he moved unnoticed into the close quarters of ravana
hanuman ranged undaunted from one mansion to another including the pleasure gardens
courageous and swift hanuman sprang from prahastas house to mahaparshvas and so on
then the great vanara leaped from the residence of kumbhakarna which looked like a cloud to vibhishanas
the great vanara leaped from mahodaras to virupakshas from vidyujjihvas to vidyunmali and then to vajradanstras
the brilliant leader of monkeys bounded to the house of suka to the clever saranas and to indrajits
the noble vanara jumped from jambumalis to sumalis and from rashmiketus suryaketus and to vajrakayas residence
hanuman jumped the houses of dhumraksha sampati vidyudrupa bhima ghana and vighana sukanasa vakra shatha vikata brahmakarna damshtra romasa yuddhonmatta matta dhvajagriva nadi vidyujjihva and indrajihva hastimukha karala pisacha and sonitaksha
the illustrious son of the windgod jumped from house to house in an order and saw the wealth of the wealthy in the lofty mansions
passing all the mansions the lucky hanuman reached the residence of the demon king ravana
the heroic and powerful vanara saw at ravanas residence demonesses with hideous eyes guarding the bed and an army of demons holding tridents hammers powerful javelins and iron cudgels
at his ravanas residence hanuman also noticed troops of huge demons ready with different kinds of weapons
he saw horses of high speed in red white and cream colours he saw beautiful wellbred elephants which were not inferior to the enemys they were welltrained and had proved equal to airavata indras elephant in battles resembling the thundering clouds they were unassailable to the enemy in war and were trumpeting like a cluster of clouds
he saw in the palace of ravana the demon king thousands of troops adorned with gold fully protected with armour of gold shining like the morning sun
the son of the windgod saw at the palace of ravana the lord of demons colourful palanquins of several kinds bowers picture galleries spots for sporting hillocks artificial made of wood apartments for romance for pleasures and day time activities
comparable to mount mandara it was crowded with peacocks set with flag staffs fixed all over magnificent mansions built by skilled craftsmen with great efforts decked with gems of several kinds rich with treasures comparable to kailasa the home of siva the lord of all beings
the palace of ravana looked splendid with gems of different hues and with ravanas presence it was shining like the radiant sungod
the leader of the vanaras saw there beds seats and main vessels made of gold
hanuman entered the delightful lofty palace comparable to kuberas mansion it was filled with vessels encrusted with gems scattered all over the floor was drenched with liquor it was resonating with sounds of golden anklets of women and of drums the rows of mansions lofty palaces with welllaid apartments were full of hundreds of exquisite women     thus ends the sixth sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
powerful hanuman beheld the conglomeration of buildings with golden lattices encrusted with vaidurya with flocks of birds comparable to a complex of clouds pierced by lightning during rainy season
attached to the spacious halls of the houses were storehouses for valuable conches weapons bows and arrows on the top of the attics on these mansions were large and delightful terraces open to the moon
the monkey saw numerous kinds of treasures cherished by gods and demons which were won by ravanas might
the mansions of the lord of lanka built with great care and effort on earth were by all means excellent and appeared as though built personally by maya the divine architect wellknown for magical skills
hanuman beheld the magnificent and soulcaptivating palace possessing the splendour of molten gold of matchless beauty it looked like a towering cloud worthy of the might of ravana the lord of ogresses
it appeared splendid like a scattered piece of heaven on earth glittering with countless gems it looked like a mountain peak covered with pollen of flowers dropped from all kinds of trees
the aerial chariot was lit up by resplendent women just as a raincloud dazzles with flashes of lightning it was auspicious worthy of worship it looked as if it was drawn by royal swans in the sky
a jewel among aerial chariots it looked colourful with many gems beset it appeared like the summit of a mountain decorated with the colours of minerals like the sky bespangled with planets and the moon and like a mass of multicoloured clouds adorned by a rainbow
the whole earth had been picturised on it it was filled with rows of mountains and a canopy of trees all over the trees were filled with lovely flowers with petals and filaments drawn on them
there were pictures of mansions white in colour and pools of crystalclear water filled with lovely flowers there were pictures of beautiful lotuses drawn on it
there the great hanuman indeed saw a splendid chariot called pushpaka it was glowing with glittering gems taller than the biggest mansion it was a great chariot
inside were birds made of vaidurya silver and corals there were colourful serpents made of various gems and highclass horses of exquisite limbs drawn
it had curved figures of birds with beautiful wings carved out of corals and gold the wings were shining as if they were really the wings of allies of cupid the god of love
he saw on it lotus ponds artificial elephants with shapely trunks offering to laxmi who herself was a lotus holding in her beautiful hands blue lotuses shining with filaments
thus he reached the auspicious palace appearing like a beautiful mountain and stood wonderstruck once again he looked at that beautiful palace which appeared like a mountain with lovely caverns in spring time filled with wonderful fragrance
then hanuman moved about that cherished city ruled by the strength of arms of the tenheaded king unable to find venerable sita who was deprived of the benefit of her husbands virtuous proximity he became deeply sad
unable to find sita the disciplined and foresighted hanuman who always kept the righteous path felt distressed while moving about his mind oppressed by all kinds of thought     thus ends the seventh sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
the courageous son of the windgod hanuman the vanara saw the aerial chariot kept in the middle of the mansion inlaid with gems and diamonds latticed with artificial windows of barnished gold
the immeasurable pushpaka fashioned by visvakarma with images of incomparable beauty was not possible to describe an excellent product of his achievement it was placed in the aerial path appearing as a beaconlight signpost in the orbit of the sun
there was nothing in pushpaka which was not executed carefully with special effort nothing which was not made of precious stones such privileges were not available to even gods indeed there was nothing which was not unique
the pushpaka was designed by dint of divine efforts and prowess of kubera it could touch any place its master commanded with a cool mind it had many beautiful places of rest
the pushpaka was specially designed in a unique manner it was decorated with many colourful peaks it was delghtful and pleasing to the mind and bright like the autumnal fullmoon it looked like a mountain with many wonderful towers around
the pushpaka was borne by multitudes of bhutas whose faces were shining with earrings who were demons ranging in the night sky they were gluttons endowed with great speed and they had big rolling and frightening eyes
that hero among monkeys beheld the aerial chariot looking beautiful like a colourful collection of spring blossoms its appearance was more pleasant than spring itself     thus ends the eighth sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
the son of the windgod hanuman saw a huge spacious and excellent of all mansions in the centre of the palace
the mansion of the lord of demons was a conglomeration of palaces half a yojana long and half a yojana wide
hanuman the subduer of enemies went around in search of the largeeyed vaidehi
searching the excellent residences of important demons hanuman finally reached the palace of the lord of ogres guarded by armed demons with elephants with two or three or four tusks
hanuman entered the palace of ravana crowded with shedemons who were the wives of ravana and the princesses brought by him after winning them in wars to hanuman it looked like an ocean filled with crocodiles sharks whales and a variety of fishes and snakes tossed by the force of the wind
whatever wealth was possessed by vaisravana kubera the son of sage vishrava and also indra who rides the ucchaisrava green horse was there in the palace of ravana
the wealth stored in ravanas palace was akin to what lay in the palaces of kubera yama or varuna and ever more exquisite
hanuman saw in the centre of that palace a complex of many wellbuilt houses
there was a wonderful aerial chariot called pushpaka embellished with all kinds of gems built by visvakarma for brahma it was the same one that kubera had won from his grandfather the creator brahma through his supreme penance the lord of ogres acquired it as a memento for his victory by defeating kubera with his might
it was supported by finely built pillars of two types of gold kartaswara and hiranmaya with images of wolves carved on them and blazing it was tall as if scraping the sky and resembled mountains like meru and mandara it was graced with multitudes of auspicious and decorated pleasurehouses everywhere
it was well built by visvakarma and and had golden stairways with radiant platforms glowing like fire and sun
it had latticed windows made of gold inlaid with crystals the platforms were encrusted with saphires called indraneela and mahaneela appropriately
it was shining bright with colourful corals precious gems and peerless pearls fixed on its floor
it was bright like molten gold fragrant with red sandal comparable to the rising sun
hanuman ascended the wonderful pushpaka welldecked with many corridors
there he smelt the stupefying unearthly odour of food and drink he felt as though the fragrance had taken a potentially solid formnote the wind has no form but when he carried the aroma of food and drink it appeared like the personification of wind which could be smelt   fragrance comes from earth  the poet transmits the same to the wind who has got only  sense of touch
the fragrance was as if inviting the mighty hero like a relative inviting his kith and kin saying come here and leading him to a place where ravana rested
then he proceeded to an auspicious hall which was ravanas favourite like his chief queen dear to his heart
the stairways of the mansion were inlaid with special gems windows were latticed with gold floors were covered with crystals figures of ivory with silver
it was decorated with pillars of silver and gold inlaid with pearls and corals and gems
it had highly ornamented pillars all over some slightly bent and others straight with lofty columns looking like wings it appeared as if the mansion had started on its journey to heaven
the floor was covered with a wide carpet spread from wall to wall with designs of different murals of many places and houses drawn in a row garland like the big carpet appeared like the expanse of earth itself
the mansion was resounding with the noise of birds singing in heat it had wonderful fragrance it was laid with exquisite tapestries and served as a dwelling place for the king of demons
it was smoky with fumes of agaru incence though spotless like a swan it was colourful and radiant like kamadhenu the wishfulfilling cow because of the offering of flowers
the mansion was so full of effulgence and soul ravishing that it served as an adornment even to splendour it looked as though it banished all sorrow and was a source of prosperity
the chamber of ravana like a mother gratified all the five senses of hanuman with proper objects of the senses
this may be heaven or world of gods it may be amaravati the abode of indra or else it may be the supreme achievment of the creator thought maruti
seeing the golden lamps that stood burning steadily hanuman thought they looked like gamblers in deep thought defeated by expert gamblers in a game of dice
hanuman fancied that the entire place was set ablaze with the glow of lamps the lustre of ravana and the brilliant glow of ravanas ornaments everything was shining
he found thousands of beautiful women seated on carpets wearing different clothes and garlands and dressed in various attires
drinking and sporting until midnight they had dropped off to sleeptired
fast asleep sounds of their ornaments silenced the young women looked like a large bed of lotuses with swans and bees sitting calm without their usual noise
hanuman looked at the faces of the wellbred young women with closed eyes and concealed teeth fragrant like lotuses
the faces of the women looked like blooming lotuses at daybreak their petals closed up again at night
the intoxicated bees would again and again long to enjoy these beautiful faces which were like blooming lotuses
the illustrious hanuman felt it to be correct to compare those faces with lotuses for their fragrance
brightened by the beauty of the maidens the mansion shone like the autumnal sky endearing and pleasing with stars
the lord of demons surrounded by women shone like the beautiful moon encircled by stars
seeing those women lying together hanuman imagined them to be numerous meteors dropped from heaven after enjoying their merits enjoyed and exhausted
it was clear that the grace and lustre of those women looked brilliant like the lustre and grace of brilliant stars releasing an auspicious glow
garlands displaced and jewels scattered they were drowsy due to drink and sexual exercise
a few young women had their circular vermilion mark on the forehead smudged some had their anklets loosened and a few had their necklaces
some had their strings of pearl broken others had their clothes slipped off and some had their waist belts snapped they were like young mares fallen to rest after carrying heavy loads
with their good eartops broken and flower garlands crushed some looked like blooming creepers in a dense forest crushed by mighty elephants
the pearl chains large and shining like rays of the moon in the space between the breasts looked like sleeping swans
the vaidurya worn by women on the breasts looked like kadamba birds while the golden chains put on by some others appeared like ruddy geese
their hips were like river banks crowded with swans karandava and chakravaka birds shining like rivers
with their tiny bells round their girdle looking like buds the bold golden ornaments like lotuses their gestures of love like crocodiles and their radiant beauty like silver banks the women looked like smoky rivers
the beautiful imprints made by the heavy ornaments on the tender limbs breasts and nipples of some women appeared like many ornaments
shaken by the breath released from their mouths the fringes of the garments of some women were drawn towards their faces again and againfluttering
the fringes of their garments glowing beautifully close to the faces of the wives of ravana with different beautiful hues shone splendid like flags
the eartops of some women endowed with auspicious charm were swinging softly generating a gentle sound by the touch of their breath
the sweet smell of wine emitted from their mouth and the natural fragrance of their breath was refreshing to ravana as if it was serving him at that time
some women of ravana overcome by blind passion smelt again and again the mouths of their cowives next to them assuming it to be ravanas
even though the beautiful wives should have been angry with their cowives for smelling their mouths they behaved pleasingly having no freedom to act with ravana
some women slept pillowed on their arms laying aside their adornments and others had their garment under the head as pillows and lay in sleep
some women lay placing their arms on the breasts of the other while their own arms were used as pillow by another one woman placed her head on the lap of the other and slept
given to intoxication and sex the women slept touching one anothers thighs sides hips back and lap of the other with their limbs intertwined
knit with the shoulders of one another like a garland of flowers intertwined with the tipsy bees resting the women shone
the women of ravana appeared like a garden in spring they were as if a cluster of creepers blossomed in spring due to the caresses of the breeze they were knit together as one string forming a garland flowers of one creeper striking the other the joints of these creepers had grown strong when tangled together shaken by the breeze the bees resting on one creeper would go to the other
it was not possible to distinguish clearly between their jewels limbs garments and garlands and to place them in the right spots
when ravana was happily asleep the gods of light burning on the gold lampposts gazed without winking as it were at the women whom they dare not gaze for fear of waking ravana
the women halled from the families of royal sages ancestral deities daityas and demons who were infatuated with him
many were brought by ravana as captives of war and some came on their own deluded by lust
except sita no other woman among them had been taken there by force they were won only on account of his valour and virtues none loved any one earlier and none was married to others
none among them was born of a lowly family nor lacked beauty kindness skill strength or brightness no one was not lovable to ravana
if the lawful wife of rama born of a good family can be allowed to remain with rama in the same way as the consorts of the lord of demons how fortunate it would be thought the wise lord of monkeys
hanuman once again assuming his true form said to himself sita is surely a virtuous lady superior to and more distinguished than them all alas this lord of lanka committed an ignoble act by abducting her     thus ends the ninth sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
looking around hanuman noticed a bed chamber with a heavenly dais on which he saw a couch encrusted with crystals vaidurya and inlaid with colourful ivory and gold it had an exquisite rich covering
hanuman saw an umbrella in one spot decorated with the best of garlands the white umbrella looked like the moon lord of stars
he saw an exquisite couch made of gold shining wonderfully like the sun it was decorated with ashoka flowers women were holding fans of chamari deer it was upholstered with the best of bedspreads made of soft sheep skin and adorned with beautiful strings of flower garlands scented with aromatic smoke it was refreshed with fragrance which had spread all over the place
hanuman saw the mightyarmed heroic lord of demons sleeping with huge bloodshot eyes looking like a cloud he was adorned with flashing earrings and clad in robes of silver texture his body was smeared with red sandal paste of sweet fragrance therefore he looked like a cloud reddened by twilight and flashing with the lightning of his ornaments he was handsome and could assume any form at will he looked like mandara mountain surrounded thickly with trees and wild bushes decked with exquisite ornaments he was sleeping after dalliance at night on that glittering couch he was the beloved of the ogresses and bringer of joy to them
hanuman saw the mightyarmed heroic lord of demons sleeping with huge bloodshot eyes looking like a cloud he was adorned with flashing earrings and clad in robes of silver texture his body was smeared with red sandal paste of sweet fragrance therefore he looked like a cloud reddened by twilight and flashing with the lightning of his ornaments he was handsome and could assume any form at will he looked like mandara mountain surrounded thickly with trees and wild bushes decked with exquisite ornaments he was sleeping after dalliance at night on that glittering couch he was the beloved of the ogresses and bringer of joy to them
having reached ravana who was breathing hissing like a snake hanuman was for a moment frightened and drew away from him as if he was put to terrible fear
the great vanara ascended the stairway and reached another altar and once again looked at the sleeping ravana the tiger among demons
while the lord of demons lay asleep on the magnificent couch he looked like the prasravana hill with its elephant in rut
hanuman saw the great ravanas arms which were like a pair of indras flag staff adorned with golden straps the arms bore the marks of wounds caused by airavata indras elephant torn by the thunderbolt of indra in war and wounded by the discus of lord visnu his strong fleshy wellbuilt arms having auspicious thumbnails shapely fingers and palms pressed together resembled the iron crowbars or beam used for main doors the arms resembled elephants trunks tossed on a clean bed resembling two fivehooded snakes fingers like hoods besmeared with cool fragrant red sandalpaste of excellent quality which looked red like the hares blood they were well massaged by the best of women with fine fragrant sandal paste they were the arms which could make yakshas pannagas gods and demons roar in fear at their sight
the vanara gazed at the arms of ravana placed on the couch that appeared like two angry snakes asleep in a cave on the lap of mount mandara
the lord of demons looked splendid like a mountain with his long fully developed arms he appeared like mandara mountain with two lofty peaks
the breath released from the huge mouth of that lion of demons carried the fragrance of mango and punnaga as well as excellent bakula flowers it exuded the aroma of rich and delicious food and different drink it was as though pervading the whole chamber
hanuman saw ravana whose face was lit up by his earrings his shining headgear studded with gold and pearls was set aside his fleshy broad chest on which the pearl necklace had slightly receded from its positionas he was asleep was shining along with the red sandal paste he had put on a splendid white silken cloth which had also slipped a little and was covered with exquisitely rich yellow upper garment his eyes were bloodred his body was comparable to a heap of blackbeans he was sighing heavily like a hissing snake he appeared like an elephant sleeping on the banks of the great river ganges with four golden lamps glowing on four sides of the bedthe four directions were illuminated all his limbs lit up bright with the glow of lamps he looked like a cloud with streaks of lightning his dear wives were seen resting at his feet in the palace of the lord of demons
hanuman the leader of vanaras found the wives of ravana whose faces were bright as the moon adorned with beautiful earrings and fresh floral garlands
hanuman saw the women there wearing fine jewellery performing dances playing musical instruments and resting on the lap or leaning on the arms of the demon king
he noticed on the earlobes of the the women gold earrings decked with diamonds and vaidurya they were wearing shining armlets of gold
there the beautiful moonlike faces of women illumined by the lovely earrings lay on the cot which looked resplendent like the sky lit up with hosts of stars
exhausted by drinking and indulging in amorous sport the consorts of ravana slept here and there with their visible slender waists
another woman exceedingly beautiful and a delicate danseuse of beautiful complexion and rhythmic movements held her limbs in a dancing posture though asleep due to her habit
another woman slept hugging her veena she shone like a lotus plant flung in a large river clinging on to a boat veena is compared to a boat and the woman to a lotusplant in the ambience of flowing waters of the river the entire hall had put up such a dynamic view showing hectic life of the inmates
a woman with dark eyes asleep with a drum placed in her armpit looked like a beautiful mother holding her loving baby the drum was hung to her arm with a rope
another charming beauty endowed with beautiful breasts lay hugging a tambourine as though a passionate woman lay embracing her lover whom she secured after a long time
yet another lotuseyed lady slept embracing a lute as if a lovelorn woman lay clasping her lover
another selfpossessed lady graceful in dance holding a sevenstringed lute was as though lying asleep with her beloved
another lady with drunken eyes lay fast asleep holding a drum close to her beautiful bosom with her soft limbs these images show that these women were singing and dancing till late night and slept exhausted
another lady of slender belly who had been exhausted by drunkeness was lying with a tabor pressed to her bosom and inserted in her armpit
one lovely woman and another held a drum and slept as if they were hugging their young child
yet another with her eyes like lotus petals deluded with passion tightly held in her arms a musical instrument known as adambaram and slept
another lovely lady was fast asleep having turned a goblet of water aside yet another lay like a garland of variegated flowers in spring season
overcome with sleep another woman lay pressing with her own hands her golden gobletlike breasts
one woman with eyes like lotus petals and face like the fullmoon embraced another young woman of beautiful hips and slept tipsy with drink
some charming maidens held wonderful musical instruments pressing against their bosom and slept like passionate women embracing their loved ones
hanuman saw some maidens lying on separate excellent beds women richly endowed with beautysleeping
then the vanara saw a very beautiful woman of golden complexion decked with pearls and gems and with ornaments as if illuminating the excellent mansion with her splendour she was the kings favourite and the chief queen mandodari
on seeing her embellished with ornaments beauty and charm the long armed son of the windgod the chief of the vanaras thought her to be sita and rejoiced
he rejoiced clapping his palms kissing his tail and jumping up climbing up the pillars and jumping down on the ground in joy thus he exhibited his monkey nature     thus ends the tenth sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
the great vanara having rejected his judgement started thinking again
lovely sita being away from rama will not sleep will not eat or drink or adorn herself how can she approach any other man even if he is the king of gods for there is none equal to rama even among gods having thus decided hanuman strolled about the banquet hall
some women were fatigued after sporting similarly some were exhausted after singing others were tired through dancing and some were worn out by continuous drinking
some women reclined on tabors some on murajas and some on drums and hassocks while some slept on excellent couches
the monkey leader saw thousands of beautiful women asleep after long dalliance some of them were adorned with ornaments some were good at arguments and versed in the appreciation of songs some were aware of the appropriate time and place and some were adept in right expressions
in the midst of these women the longarmed lord of demons shone like a majestic bull in a big cowshed
surrounded by the women the demon king shone like a proud elephant attended by many female elephants scattered in a dense forest
the tiger among vanaras saw at the great ravanas palace a drinking place where everything one desires was provided
there at the drinking hall the meat of deer buffaloes and boars portioned and placed
the tiger among vanaras also saw there meat of peacocks and chicken placed in large golden vessels some half eaten
hanuman saw the meat of pigs and jungle fowls deer peacocks and bones marinated with yoghurt and special kinds of salt
he saw several kinds of nonvegetarian food like cooked meat of fowls ruddy geese buffaloes goats fishes as well as food for licking food is of four kinds  which can be chewed  ordinary solid semisolid food which can be consumed  food for licking  liquid food which can be sipped
the banquet hall looked splendid with food seasoned with salt and sour ingredients there was ragashadavas syrup made with grapes pomegranates different juices like half ripe mangoes and seasoned with ginger cardomom butter etc heavy chains anklets and shouldersstraps were thrown aside the people relaxed while eating and drinking and discarded heavy ornaments many glasses were found scattered or drinks spilt on the floor after usemany fruits and flowers were kept
good couches and different kinds of seats were wellarranged in the banquet hall the place appeared as if it was glowing witout fire
in the banquet hall there were many types of meat arranged in a number of ways they were cooked by experts by seasoning them with choicest ingredients
there were many types of wonderful and pleasing wine extracted from sugarcane honey fruits and flowers they were good even though fermented and made delicious by seasoning with aromatic spices
the banquet hall appeared beautiful with many kinds of garlands arranged in different locations also there were vessels made of pure gold crystalware and jars spread all over
hanuman saw the best of wines in large quantities kept in silver and pure gold pots
the great monkey saw the wine jars made of gold and silver studded with crystals and gems
he saw wine jars at one place some fully drained and at another place not touched at all
he moved about looking at different types of eatables and drinks arranged separately along with the left over food
at some places he saw broken pots at other places rolling pots and elsewhere flower garlands strewn and mixed up with water and fruits
hanuman saw many beds some unused and some occupied by lovely women sleeping embracing one another
overcome with sleep some women pulled clothes of other women and covered their bodies with them
the lovely clothes and garlands on the bodies of women were moving mildly by their exhalations as if shaken by the gentle breeze
with the many scents of cool sandal of sweetsmelling wines of diverse kinds as well as flower garlands of several types and of incense burning in that hall the cool wind blew spreading several fragrances all over
the wind wafting through the pushpaka chariot carried the fragrance of the cool sandalpaste used in bath and the sweet smell of wines and thick smoke of fragrance spread further
there in the demons abode were women who were fair some lovely with dark and others with golden complexion
withered due to indulgence in sex they were overcome with sleep the charm of the women was like the lotus creepers with closed lotuses
brilliant hanuman ransacked the harem of ravana but found no janaki
the great monkey was very much worried as he thought he had transgressed the moral code by watching the women
observing the wives of others in this manner in their inner chambers very much amounts to transgression of moral code by me thought he
i did see these wives of another but not with a sensual mind i have only seen them but not with foul intention
another bright idea struck the highly sensible hanuman who had a clear vision of the task ahead i was firm and singleminded in my direction regarding the task ahead thought he
it is true i saw all the loyal wives of ravana but without any foul desire indeed in my mind no passionate feeling was ever aroused
mind propels the sense organs to do good or bad deeds but my mind is firmly esatablished in righteousness
it is not possible for me to look for vaidehi elsewhere during such search operations one always looks for women among women
one has to search a creature among its own species it is not possible to find a lost woman in the herd of female deer
i searched all over ravanas harem with a pure mind but i have not seen janaki
even while valiant hanuman was looking among the daughters of gods gandharvas and nagas he could not find janaki
heroic hanuman unable to find sita among the women moved aside and started thinking
illustrious hanuman left the banquet hall to renew his effort in search of sita     thus ends the eleventh sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
anxious to find sita hanuman revisited the bowers of creepers picture galleries and domitories located in the midst of the mansion but did not find that beautiful sita
the great monkey unable to find the beloved of rama thought sita might not be surviving so he started thinking i could not see her even though i have searched all over
janaki follower of noble path anxious to protect her chastity must have been killed by the wicked demon king
the daughter of janaka might have collapsed out of fear looking at the distorted faces of ugly tall and monstrous demon maids of ravana
i have spent a long time with vanaras i have not succeded in my efforts to find sita i dare not see sugriva now without finding sita and without fulfilling my task sugriva will punish me severely there is no way out
i have searched all over the harem ravanas women have been seen yet i have not been able to see noble sita my efforts have been wasted
what will the vanaras say when i return what should i speak when they ask me o hero what did you accomplish there
since the time limit has exceeded and janaki is not spotted surely the vanaras would sit and wait unto death what am i going to say
what will the elderly jambavan say what will young prince angada and other vanaras collected there say when i reach the seashore to meet them
wise hanuman once again declared being free from despair is the root cause of prosperity freedom from despondency gives supreme happiness and leads to success
the action of a living being certainly bears fruit therefore i shall put forth my best effort without feeling despondent i will once again search everywhere in lanka ruled by ravana
i have searched the banquet halls bowers of creepers picture galleries and gymnasiums i have searched everywhere through the paths of gardens and mansions harems and the pushpaka chariot also
thinking thus he started searching once again the basement cells temples homes within homes
the great vanara searched all over again and again jumping up and down stopping for a while and moving opening and closing doors by crossing entering and exiting jumping up and down thus he moved about and searched whereever there was scope to search
even a space of four fingers in the inner chambers of ravana was not left out in his search for sita
he moved in the lanes inside the boundary walls around the shrines altars wells and tanks whereever it was possible to look for
hanuman could see only ogresses of different typesugly deformed but could not find the daughter of janaka
hanuman could see even the women of vidyadharas who were matchless in beauty among women in the world but not janaki the beloved of raghava
hanuman could see there moonfaced daughters of nagas with charming limbs but not the slimwaisted sita
hanuman saw the daghters of nagas kidnapped by ravana forcibly after victory in war but not sita the delight of janaka
the longarmed hanuman son of the windgod was able to see other great women but not sita so he became despondent
the son of the wind god the great monkey realised the futility of his efforts in crossing the sea he brooded again
hanuman son of the windgod came out of the aerial chariot mind stricken with grief and started thinking again     thus ends the twelfth sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
hanuman the vanara leader jumped from the aerial chariot to the boundary wall like a flash of lightning in the clouds
going round the palace of ravana unable to see janakas daughter sita hanuman spoke thus to himself
i have thoroughly surveyed the entire city of lanka to please rama but i am unable to find sita of flawless beauty
i have searched for sita thoroughly in waterlogs lakes tanks streams and rivers and all over the woods and among mountains that are difficult to reach i have searched all over the land but have not been able to find janaki
sampati king of vultures had said that sita is at ravanas palace but i have not been able to see her
can it be that mythili daughter of janaka dejected and helpless succumbed to the evil intentions of ravana
or perhaps she might have been dropped midway from the hold of ravana while he was flying at great speed afraid of the deadly arrows of rama
or perhaps while being borne away on the path frequented by siddhas the beloved of rama might have fallen down dead heart broken on seeing the vast sea
he thinks on account of the high speed during the flight of ravana under the pressure of his arms the noble largeeyed lady might have given up her life
surely she might have fallen into the sea while wriggling in her effort to extricate herself from the hold of ravana as he was flying over the sea
oh poor sita distanced from relations while protecting her chastity helplessly she might have been devoured by cruel ravana
or else the pious blackeyed sita might have been eaten by the the cruelnatured wives of the lord of demons
or she might have attained death meditating on rama whose face resembles the fullmoon and eyes the lotus petals
or vaidehi the princess of mithila might have cast off her life grieving intensely and crying alas rama alas lakshmana alas ayodhya mithila is the name of the capital city and videha is the country which was ruled by janaka sita the princess is known as vaidehi mythili and janaki
or i think sita might have been imprisoned in a cage like a myna in ravanas palace she will be surely crying
how could janaki the daughter of janaka ramas wife the lady with a beautiful waist and eyes like lotus petals come under the fold of ravana
whether janaki is lost or irretrievable or dead is not known the news should not be reported to rama who is very fond of his wife
to carry or not to carry this news to rama would be a mistake what shall i do i am facing a tough situation
i wonder what the right course of action is when things have taken such a turn what is proper for me to do hanuman once again deliberated
if i return to kishkinda without seeing sita of what use is my effort what have i accomplished what will happen dharma artha kama and moksha are the four purusharthas or accomplishments in life
my crossing the ocean my entry into lanka and my survey of the demons are all futile
what will sugriva or even the vanaras and the two sons of dasaratha say when i reach kishkinda
if i report the most unpleasant news that sita was not found rama will give up his life
seeing rama in such a painful state wise lakshmana who has given his life to rama to whom he is deeply devoted will also not survive
on hearing the death of both the brothers bharata will also die on seeing this satrughna will also not live
on seeing that rama has ended his life the grateful and truthful monkey leader sugriva will give up his life
distressed disheartened pained and grieved on account of her husbands death the virtuous lady ruma wife of sugriva will be unhappy and die
tara who is troubled by valis death and tortured with grief will not live when king sugriva dies
on account of his parents death and also because of sugrivas calamity angada will give up his life
the grief due to the death of their king will make the vanaras hit their heads with their palms and fists
the vanaras who were reared by the kings kind words gifts and care will give up their life
the chiefs among vanaras together will not enjoy their life in the forest or mountains or caves
tormented by their kings death the vanaras with their wives sons and ministers will drop down from the mountain peaks on the rough ground and die
the vanaras will put an end to their lives by poisoning or by hanging or by selfimmolation or by killing themselves with weapons or by fasting unto death
if i go there without finding sita it will cause destruction of the ikshvakus and vanaras would weep it would be dreadful
i will not go to the city of kishkinda from here or to sugriva without finding mythili it will not be possible for me to face him
both the highsouled warrior princes treading a righteous path as well as the vanaras will survive with a hope of my return if i stay back
if janaki is not found i will stay here and live like a hermit subsisting on whatever is available on this sea shore which has abundance of roots fruits and water
i will prepare a pyre and enter the fire so that sea waves wash off the ashes or crows and beasts will eat up my body while i sit fasting unto death
i shall enter water and drown myself to death if i am not able to find janaki i think this way of ending life has been suggested by great ascetics
my glory which had a good start in the form of bringing rama to sugriva and brought fortune to sugriva and fame to me has been snapped as i could not find sita
i will remain an ascetic and do penance under the tree practising selfcontrol and not go back without seeing the blackeyed sita
besides if i go back without finding sita all the vanaras including angada will die
if i commit suicide i will earn numerous sins by being alive i can witness auspicious events therefore i will live for happiness can come only to the living
the elephant among monkeys hanuman worrying over and over again holding his head for long could not reach the end of his grief
i will kill ravana this mighty tenheaded demon sita was indeed carried away by him this killing him can be a fitting reply to his evil action my desire would be fulfilled
or else i shall carry him across the sea and put him before rama like a bull as if he is a sacrificial prey to lord siva
distressed over his inability to find sita hanumans mind was overcome with anxiety and he started thinking further
till i find the virtuous sita wife of rama in this lanka i shall keep searching everywhere again and again
had i brought raghava following the words of sampati rama would have burnt all vanaras unable to find his wife
i will stay here itself restricting my food and controlling my senses let not men and monkeys perish for my fault
here is the ashoka grove with huge trees i will go there i have not looked for her in this place
i shall offer salutations to vasus rudras adityas and aswinis and proceed to increase cause the sorrow of the demons there are eight vasus eleven rudras twelve adityas two ashwins and fortynine windgods
i will conquer all the ogres and pass them to sita the delight of the ikshvaku family as an offering and give rama to her as the fruit of her austerities
the brilliant son of the windgod hanuman whose senses were overwhelmed with worries regained his senses in a short while and got up
my salutations to lakshmana rama and divine daughter of janaka salutations to rudra indra yama and vayu salutations to sun moon and maruts
having offered salutations to all gods as well as to sugriva he looked at all quarters and left for the ashoka grove
hanuman started thinking again about his task after reaching the auspicious ashoka grove
this ashoka grove filled with many trees guarded by many demons is carefully tended it must be sacred
the guards posted there are surely protecting the grove the divinity pervading all over me the wind must also have been controlled as it is also not blowing violently i have turned my body small for ramas cause and also to save myself from ravana
may all sages gods the selfborn brahma windgod indra the wielder of thunderbolt whose name is invoked in sacrifices yama who carries a rope varuna give success and lord siva help me may the sun moon aswinis marutas assist me may the gods of the quarters and the lord of all beings help me to succeed may those whom i could not see also bring success to me
oh when and how would i behold that beautiful noble lady of stainless character with a moonlike face prominent nose white teeth pleasant smile and with eyes like lotus petals
how will i set my eyes on that gentle frail and suffering thing now who has been abducted by that mean cruel sinner of dreadful look     thus ends the thirteenth sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
mighty hanuman lost in thought for a moment jumped down the harem to the boundary wall of the palace
standing on the boundary wall the great vanara contracted his body and observed the blossoms on several tree tops salas lovely ashoka trees and blossoms of champak uddalaka naga mangoes with their fruits crimson as the snout of a monkey it being the beginning of spring
he penetrated like an arrow released from a bow the cluster of trees covering mango grove and overgrown with hundreds of creepers
entering deep into the grove hanuman saw clusters of trees pleasing to look at herds of animals and flocks of colourful birds singing melodious notesthe grove was surrounded on all sides by silvery and golden trees which looked colourful with flocks of birds and herds of deer it was full of lovely thickets looking like the rising sun it was fringed with various trees bearing abundance of fruits and flowers it was inhabited by intoxicated cuckoos bees proud peacocks and numerous lovely birds
the vanara who went searching for the paragon of virtue born of a noble family awakened the birds who were happily asleep in their nests
as the birds flew away the trees hit by the wings of birds showered flowers of different colours
covered with flowers hanuman shone like a mountain of flowers in the midst of ashoka grove
beholding that sprightly monkey running in all directions its body covered with variegated blossoms fallen from the trees all living beings there thought that it was spring personified
strewn with flowers of various colours fallen from the trees of various kinds the goddess of earth looked charming like a young woman profusely bedecked
shaken vigorously by hanuman of great speed the trees shed their blooms of variegated colours
the tree tops shorn of their leaves and flowers and fruits fallen appeared like gamblers who had lost their stakes and had to lay down their clothes and ornaments
shaken by the swift hanuman even the big trees dropped flowers fruits and leaves
deserted by the flocks of birds resting on them flowers and leaves also dropped from branches the trees were left bare with trunks unable to move
the garden of ashoka with trees shattered and crushed by hanumans tail hands and feet appeared like a woman with dishevelled hair with her vermilion mark effaced her bright teeth and lips faded for being kissed and wounded with nails and bitten with teeth by her lover
hanuman shook with tremendous speed the huge clusters of creepers hanging there just like stormy wind in rainy season scatters masses of clouds on the vindhya mountain
roaming there the monkey noticed the beautiful floors paved with gems gold and silver
he observed ponds of different shapes filled with clear water with steps paved with rich gems with sands of pearls and corals and bottoms of crystal which contained beds of lotuses in bloom adorned with chakravaka birds and resonant with cacklings of swans and sarasas and vatyuhas rubbing their beaks there were golden platforms built on banks and platforms built of crystals there were trees on the bank of streams and nectarlike sacred waters flowing in them surrounded by hundreds of creepers and ashoka blossoms scattered everywhere with thickly grown bushes of different kinds with lilies in bloom in tanks
the tiger among monkeys beheld a delightingful mountain resembling the raincloud with tall pleasing peaks wonderful peaks spread all over the mountain there were caves built of stone with a variety of trees
hanuman the great monkey saw a stream descending from the hill which looked like a beloved jumping down from the thighs of her lover it was adorned with trees whose boughs touched the water and thus looking like an angry woman leaving her dear lover but detained by her relatives with the water running backward in circles it appeared as if the beloved has returned to her lover pleased
not far from there hanuman son of the windgod sighted lotus ponds filled with different kinds of water birds
hanuman saw an oblong pond full of cool water provided with steps embellished with gems and beautified with pearl dust as sand on its bank thronged with many kinds of animals it looked colourful with large mansions constructed by visvakarma in the artificial woodlands decorated all over
there the trees had abundance of flowers and fruits a few trees were full of leaves and branches spread like parasols there were raised golden platforms
the monkey leader saw one simsupa tree covered all over with canopies of many climbers and leaves the tree was surrounded by golden platforms
he beheld several pieces of land and streams flowing out of the springs he also noticed golden trees asresplendent as fire
he saw trees resplendent with golden radiance and thought that he was in the midst of gold like the sungod getting golden hue by the radiance of meru the golden mountain
hanuman was wonderstruck to hear the sound produced by rows of golden trees which stood round the simsupa tree this sound resembled the tinkling of a hundred anklets when the wind passed through their leaves
strongarmed hanuman climbed up the simsupa tree shining with flowers on its top and surrounded by tender sprouts and leaves he said to himself
i may see by chance from this point vaidehi tormented with grief anxiously waiting to see rama while moving about here and there casually
surely this beautiful ashoka grove with delightful champak chandan and bakula trees belongs to the wicked ravana
this lovely lotuspond is frequented by flocks of aquatic birds surely ramas queen janaki will come to this place
beautiful janaki beloved queen of rama loves to wander in forests she will surely visit this grove
or may be that doeeyed noble lady brooding over rama will come to this garden she is familiar with
that lovelyeyed queen tormented with grief over separation from rama will be coming here to stay as she always loves strolling in the forest
the daughter of janaka the chaste wife of rama used to for the company of those creatures wandering in the forest
surely that lady of lovely complexion the beautiful janaki will come to this river flowing with sacred waters for performing the evening rituals
to the auspicious sitathe beloved of rama the lord of the world this ashoka grove is a befitting place
the moonfaced queen will certainly come to this stream of auspicious water if she is surviving
pondering thus the highsouled hanuman remained concealed on the tree loaded with flowers and leaves and waited looking eagerly for the wife of the lord of the people      thus ends the fourteenth sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
hanuman looked out from the simsupa tree all around for mythili scanning the ground below
hanuman surveyed from the simsupa tree the ashoka grove of trees full of fine fragrance it looked welldecorated like the nandana garden of indra it teemed with animals and birds it was filled with the voices of the cuckoos it had tall mansions and underground chamber there were golden lilies and lotuses in the lakes enchanting couches with rich coverings and trees full of blossoms of all seasons and fruits in abundance with the ashoka tree shedding showers of flowers from time to time the place shone with the splendour of sunrise it glittered like inflamed fire the ashoka tree had hundreds of colourful birds on the branches it appeared as if it had branches without leaves which made them look like earornaments of the grove ashoka flowers in bloom hung down to the base of the tree as if to take away the grief of the onlookers the blossoms of the karnikara and kimsuka brightened the whole grove

the grove shone bright as if it were inflamed fire with beautiful trees like purnaga saptaparna champak and uddalaka in full bloom
there were thousands of ashoka trees some of which shone like gold others like the flames of fire and some dark as collyrium
the grove with different types of gardens spread over looked like the nandana garden of indra and chaitraratha garden of kubera it surpassed every other garden it was unimaginable in splendour it was divine and delightful filled with the radiance of countless varieties of blossoms shining like stars like a second firmament it was like another ocean filled with precious gems of flowers it had trees with flowers of honeyscented fragrance sounds of animals and birds filled the air it was pleasing to the heart with various divine fragrances wafted by the breeze
the monkey leader saw a lofty templelike structure in the midst of the ashoka grove which was highly fragrant and appeared like another indescribable structure that stood on a thousand pillars like another gandhamadana mountain it gleamed white like mount kailasa its stairs were paved with corals the altars were made of brightly polished gold this structure glowing with brilliance was as if stealing the eyes it looked white with light and lofty as though scratching the sky
then he beheld a lady surrounded by female demons clad in soiled clothes she looked dejected emaciated through fasting and was sighing repeatedly she appeared thin and pale like the crescent moon at the beginning of the bright fortnight
her form was faintly recognisable she had a lovely radiance on account of her beautiful form she looked like the tip of burning fire engulfed in a cloud of smoke
she was wearing an excellent single yellow cloth which was soiled unadorned she looked like a muddy lotuspond bereft of lotuses
she was bashful tormented with agony dejected with a withered look she appeared like the star rohini oppressed by planet mars
her face was filled with tears she looked dejected and emaciated due to fasting always plunged in grief she looked like one meditating in tears
unable to see her dear kith and kin she sat guarded by ogresses she appeared like a doe separated from the herd and encircled by a pack of hounds
she from behind appeared like the earth covered with a range of trees at the end of rainy season with her single long black braid touching her hips looking like a black serpent she who deserved to be happy and had not experienced worries was burning in grief  is a trait of a  sita who was forced to stay in lanka was a
after seeing the largeeyed lady worn out and dressed in soiled clothes hanuman started deliberating in himself and guessed it was sita for strong reasons
beholding the form of the largeeyed lady hanuman guessed this is similar to the form seen while the demon was kidnapping her
her face resembled the fullmoon which dispelled the encircling gloom by its radiance she had a slender waist beautiful round breasts shapely eyebrows red lips dark hair and eyes like lotus petals with attractive limbs she was comparable to rati consort of cupid
just as the radiance of the full moon is cherished by all this lady was liked by every one in this world with her lovely figure she was seated on the ground like an austere ascetic
the timid lady was hissing sighing like the consort of the serpent king who being caught in a widespread cobweb of grief was looking gloomy
she was like the flames of fire obscured by smoke she appeared like the text of smriti of doubtful meaning a treasure that has been thrown away
she was like faith shattered hope frustrated desires blocked by obstacles success vitiated fame marred and intellect blurred
she appeared like fame besmirched by false allegation she was pained by the obstruction to meet rama and emaciated by abduction
the fawneyed lady was looking here and there with her dark curved eyelashes her unhappy face was streaming with tears
covered with dirt and mud and shorn of adornments even though she deserved them she looked wretched like the radiance of the moon muffled by dark clouds
hanuman did recognise sita after looking at her carefully again and again even as one is able to make out knowledge of shastriclore forgotten with lapse of time and lack of practice
just as an unclear expression which has undergone certain changes in meaning due to lack of usage over a long period is understood by virtue of previous practice so also hanuman had difficulty in recognising sita who was devoid of any decoration
after close observation of different signs and deliberation with reasons he came to the conclusion that the largeeyed lady is the same blameless princess sita
hanuman observed the ornaments worn by vaidehi adding grace to her limbs which rama had describedthey were wellcrafted earrings and wellfit savdamshtras he noticed wonderful variegated ornaments of corals and gems as well as those worn on hands they were blackened for long wear and sita had marks of wearing them on her bodynote this is a pair ornaments shaped like dogs teeth it is not known on which part of the body they were worn
i think these ornaments are the same that were described by rama those dropped by sita are not found on her body these were not droppedthere is no doubt
the shining yellow upper garment like a golden cloth was torn flung down it stuck to a tree which the monkeys noticed
the jingling choice ornaments were thrown down on the ground
this cloth worn long is crumpled even then it has retained its shine and looks fresh
this lady of golden complexion is ramas beloved queen who does not disappear from his mind although away
she is that same lady for whom rama has been passing through compassion benevolence grief and passion he is compassionate considering her a woman kind and benevolent since she is his dependent stricken with grief for losing a wife and passionate since she is his beloved
this blackeyed sita and her divine charming body with perfect limbs are a match for ramas figure
the divine queens mind is firmly fixed on rama and his mind fixed on her for this reason she and the righteous self rama are able to survive till this moment
lord rama had accomplished a difficult task in sustaining the body this way without allowing it to sink and perish during separation from her
rama the strongarmed hero has accomplished a difficult task by surviving even for a moment without this sita who has intoxicating lustre
hanuman the bull among monkeys admired the laudable sita and the virtuous rama and once again began to lament
sagacious hanuman eyes dimmed with tears thought for a short while on the plight of sita and lamented
if sita who is worshipped by righteous lakshmana and loved by rama is tortured like this it shows it is difficult to trangress the force of time
just as river ganga is not agitated by the rainbearing clouds this sita is not perturbed as she is aware of the prowess of rama and might of lakshmana
sri rama matches vaidehi perfectly in character age behaviour birth and auspicious signs she is aware that he is the right person for her rama deserves vaidehi and this blackeyed lady deserves him
on seeing her glowing like fresh gold resembling goddess lakshmi who is dear to the entire world and thinking of rama hanuman said
it was for the sake of this largeeyed sita that the powerful vali and the heroic kabandha who was equal to ravana in heroism were killed
rama killed viradha of fearsome valour in the forest like sambara by indra
ogres like khara and trisira and the powerful dooshana were kileed in battle by rama endowed with selfknowledge
on her account sugriva obtained the coveted kingdom ruled by vali which was a difficult proposition and retained supremacy in the world
on account of the largeeyed sita i ventured to cross the lord of rivers the sea and came to this city
even if rama turns this land stretching to the ocean upside down or even the entire world on account of her it is justifiable according to me
the sovereignty over the three worlds will weigh less than one sixteenth part of janakas daughter sita
she had risen from the land when tilled by the plough and was covered with auspicious paddy dust resembling the pollen grains of lotuses this daughter of janaka the great righteous ruler of mithila this lady with unswerving devotion to her husband
this celebrated lady is the eldest daughterinlaw of the noble valiant king dasaratha who never returned from the battleground without being victorious
she is the loving wife of the righteous grateful wise and selfrealised rama she has fallen into the hands of these shedemons
on account of her immense love towards her husband she has given up all kinds of luxuries not caring for suffering she was satisfied with fruits and roots in the desolate forest engaged in serving her husband she experienced utmost joy as in her own palace a lady of golden complexion who had not experienced suffering earlier is subjected to sorrow and is tolerating calamities in this way
rama deserves to see herjust as a thirsty man longs for the source of water rama pines for this highly virtuous lady who is tormented by ravana
just as a king who had lost his kingdom feels happy on regaining it surely raghava will feel exhilarated when he gets her back
deprived of all sensual pleasures and separated from her relatives she is surviving with the hope of meeting them
she is looking at neither the shedemons nor these trees full of flowers and fruits she is surely thinking of rama with a singleminded attention
indeed the husband is the greatest ornament for a married woman hence though deserving adornment she does not like it bereft of her husband who is her only ornament
lord rama indeed performs a difficult task in surviving without her that he is not feeling despondent is a wonder
sita who is endowed with beautiful dark hair and eyes like a hundredpetalled lotus who deserves to be happy is in sorrow i grieve to see her in this state
she who has beautiful eyes like lotus petals was protected by the arms of both rama and lakshmna who is tolerant like the earth and is guarded by the female demons of hideous appearance under a tree
deprived of her charm she resembles a lotuscreeper blasted by frost this daughter of janaka has reached a pitiable condition afflicted by series of calamities she resembles a famale chakravaka separated from her mate
the top branches of ashoka trees bent down with blossoms and the moon rising with thousands of cool rays at the end of winter when spring sets in beholding which she should be delighted intensfy her sorrow
hanuman the swiftfooted bull among monkeys on his part waiting on the simsupa tree thus reflecting concluded in his mind that she was sita     thus ends the sixteenth sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
then the moon shining like a bed of lilies rose stainless ascended the clear sky and looked like a swan swimming through blue water
the moon shed clear lightas if with his brightness and his cool rays he wished to refresh the son of the windgod
then he saw sita whose face shone like the fullmoon but she was as though sinking under the burden of sorrow like a boat with heavy load sinking in water
while hanuman was eager to observe sita he saw many shedemons in ugly appearance close by her one of them was oneeyed another with a single ear a third had ears covering the body yet another had pointed spikelike ears one was breathing through the nose on the head one had long thin neck one was hairless another had hair covering like a blanket one of them had hanging ears on the forehead another had big hanging lips still another had long lips hanging up to the chin so also one had protruding knees one stunted one tall another had lips extending up to her chin yet another was longfaced and another had long knees there was one pigmy one tall one was humpbacked and another a dwarfsimilarly an ugly looking one another with gaping mouth still another with a distorted face one with yellow eyes and one of deformed face were seen
hanuman the leader of the monkeys saw there shedemons of several distorted forms some were brown in colour and some black and some quarrelsome some holding spears mallets and hammers of black iron some with faces like boars deer tigers goats and jackals feet like those of elephants camels and horses some had their head sunk into the trunk others having one hand or one leg likewise some having ears like that of a donkey or a horse or a cow some with elephant ears and some with monkey ears some with big nose without nosewith crooked nose and some without nostrils breathing through their forehead and some with the trunk of an elephant some with elephantfeet with huge feet and feet like that of cows and some with hair on their feet there were some with huge heads and necks some having large breasts bellies some with hanging breasts and some with long nails and tongues similarly there were some having faces of goats mouths of horses camels or donkeys they were terrifying armed with iron crowbars and tridents some were wrathful some with uneven gaping mouth and some with smoky hair and distorted faces they were always found drinking smeared with flesh and blood and feeding on flesh and blood their appearance was horripilating all of them were seated around the trunk of massive tree

the illustrious hanuman watched the blameless princess janaki who was seated under that tree
shorn of lustre unkempt hair filled with dust she appeared like a meteor slipped and fallen on land merits exhausted
she was rich by her reputation for chastity but poor as she yearned to see her husband though devoid of all excellent ornaments she looked adorned with love for her husband
besieged by the demon king deprived of her near and dear ones sita was looking like a fettered female elephant separated from its herd and besieged by lions
she appeared like a streak crescent of moon covered by autumnal clouds at the close of the rainy season she looked haggard since she was out of contact with her husband an unused lute with its strings let loose
she deserves to be with rama but had fallen under the sway of shedemons sitting in the midst of ashoka grove she was like a creeper without blossoms immersed in the ocean of sorrow the noble lady was like the star rohini surrounded by unpropitious planets
even though she was daubed with dirt and had no ornaments on her she looked bright like a lotus fibre smeared with mud
hanuman saw the fawneyed lady clad in crushed and soiled clothes with a pathetic face she felt no dejection when she thought of her husbands prowess the blackeyed beauty was protected by her own chastity
seeing the fawneyed sita a frightened female deer looking all around as if for some help sighing hot breath was as though burning the trees having tender leaves with her hot sighs she looked like a collective mass of all sorrows a high tide of suffering
she was a tolerant lady she had beautiful limbs which looked splendid even though she was not wearing ornaments hanuman experienced immeasurable joy on seeing mythili
seeing that lady with eyes intoxicating hanuman shed tears of joy at once he paid obeisance to rama thinking he could trace sita at last
heroic hanuman felt happy when he saw sita he offered salutations to rama and lakshmana at heart and covered himself with the leaves of the simsupa tree and waited     thus ends the seventeenth sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
the night came to a close while hanuman went searching and looking for sita at ashoka grove full of flowering trees
at dawn sounds of recitation of vedas and the six auxillary sciences ie grammar prosody etymology phonetics astronomy and the science of rituals by the brahmins among demons wellversed in performing exalted sacrificial ceremonies were heard
by that time the strongarmed powerful tennecked ravana was awakened by the delightful sounds of auspicious musical instruments
the chivalrous lord of demons woke up as usualhis raiment and garland were still in disarray and he thought of vaidehi
the demon king who was unable to hide his great passion and control his senses was drawn towards sita in his state of intoxication
adorned with all ornaments and glowing with excellent splendour he went through the path filled with trees flourishing with all kinds of flowers and fruits
ponds covered with a variety of beautiful flowers and colourful birds always cheerful looked very wonderful
watching the garden filled with trees gateways ornamented with gold and gems he entered through the pleasant pathways in the ashoka garden there were wonderful wolves and several herds of animals in the garden fruits dropped from trees were strewn all over
ravana son of sage paulasti was followed by a hundred women just as indra is trailed by the females of gods and gandharvas
some women carried golden lamps some held yalk tail fans in their hands while others bore palmleaf fans
some moved ahead of him carrying water in golden pitchers others followed him carrying circular couches to be used as seats
one glorious and compassionate lady carried in her right hand a gemstudded jar filled with wine
another shedemon moved behind him holding an umbrella with a golden handle which was white like a royal swan and bright like the fullmoon
the chief wives of ravana with eyes dizzy with sleep and drinking followed their heroic husband like streaks of lightning follow a thunder cloud ravana who was dark looked like a cloud and the women with dazzling golden complexion appeared like lightning
the necklaces and armlets of the wives disarrayed the sandal paste and other unguents on the body smudged hair hanging down their faces the sweating damsels followed ravana they were dizzy with leftover intoxication and sleep and were swaying from side to side their dishevelled hair was loose and faces filled with sweat their flower garlands on the body had wilted due to sweat on their limbs the drunken wives of ravana actuated by their high regard and passion for him followed as he advanced with drunken eyes
their husband powerful ravana under the control of passion looking dull absorbed in the thoughts of sita walked slowly as though counting his steps
then hanuman son of the windgod heard their jingling golden girdles and anklets
then hanuman the vanara saw ravana of extraordinary deeds and of unimaginable strength and valour at the entrance of ashoka garden
hanuman saw him in the glow of lamps wet with fragrant oil carried by many shedemons all over
hanuman saw him who was possessed of lust arrogance and intoxication he appeared like cupid setting aside his quiver and arrows with his curved big red eyes
he was playfully pulling up his upper garment that slipped and stuck to his armlet this excellent unsoiled robe was looking like the foam of churned nectar
hanuman seated on a leafy branch of the simsupa tree thickly covered with leaves and flowers started scanning the identity of ravana who was drawing nearer
the leader of the monkeys started gazing at the chief wives of ravana endowed with youth and beauty
surrounded by beauties the glorious king entered the grove meant for women reverberating with the sounds of beasts and birds
the brilliant vanara looked at the son of visravas ravana the demon king adorned with wonderful ornaments he had long tapering ears he was intoxicated with drink encircled by damsels he was looking like the moon surrounded by stars
the brilliant vanara hanuman son of the windgod recognising the strongarmed ravana got down a little saying this is truly the strongarmed ravana
hanuman possessed of extraordinary energy was taken aback at the might of ravana he remained hiding covered over with leaves
with the desire to see sita endowed with black hair beautiful hips plump breasts and dark sideglances ravana returned to ashokavana     thus ends the eighteenth sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
on just seeing ravana the lord of demons from a distance adorned with the best of ornaments the charming young blameles princess vaidehi of beautiful waist trembled like a banana plant shaken by a strong wind
largeeyed faircomplexioned sita seated there with her belly thighs and breasts covered with arms cried
the tennecked ravana too on his part saw sita tormented with grief guarded by the shedemons like a boat sunk in the sea
she looked woeful seated on the bare earth like the broken branch of a tree cut and fallen down on the ground
her body looked colourful with dust although she deserved adornment she had none she was like a lotus stem in mud looking bright yet dull with mud
she was as though moving towards the knower of the self the supreme king rama with the horses of her resolution yoked to the chariot of her mind
she was emaciated absorbed in thought of rama alone and crying and unable to find the end to her grief
sitting in that manner she resembled a coiled serpent queen the star rohini overshadowed by a smoking comet that is ravana
though born in a traditional righteous and virtuous family she was as though passing through a purificatory process like a lowbred woman
she resembled reputation besmirched by scandals like vedic studies slackened by lack of aplication knowledge is verified with a suitable statment of the veda which is the ultimate test of ones finding this method is adopted in all astika sastras which accept the authority of the veda
she was like great fame grown dim faith slighted worship meddled and hope frustratednote sitas condition is being compared with abstract concepts such as fame faith reverence and hope which are hit by reverses in fate she was the personification of all such suffering
she was like a prospect blasted command flouted entire direction set on flames at the time of catastrophe and articles of worship abducted by evil forces at the sacrificial ceremony
she was like a lotuscreeper blighted an army with its gallant warriors killed radiance of light blocked by darkness and a stream run dry
she was like the altar of worship defiled blazing fire extinguished and the moon eclipsed by rahu in the full moon night
she appeared like a lotuspond the excellent leaves of whose lotuses surrounded by frightened birds are destroyed by the trunks of elephants
stricken with grief caused by separation from her husband she appeared like a river gone thin and dry not fit for ablution like a night during dark fortnight of the month deprived of all its glow
a delicate lady with beautiful limbs who deserved to be in a gemcrusted house was now like a lotus stem just plucked out and scorched by the suns heat
she was sighing heavily in intense grief like a royal female elephant tied to a pillar and separated from her lord the leader of the herd
she was lovely even with a single braid of unkempt hair like the earth with a single row of dark trees covering its surface at the end of the rainy season
she was wasted and emaciated through fasting and grief depressed due to brooding and threatenings she ate very little but was rich with austerities
tormented with grief sita looked like a goddess begging rama the foremost of the raghu family with folded hands in her mind to destroy ravana the tennecked demon
blameless mythili with clear large eyes and beautiful eyelashes with a reddish tint at the corners was looking around crying ravana tried to allure sita who was deeply faithful to rama and threatened to kill her when he found her unflinching     thus ends the nineteenth sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
ravana expressed his intention in sweet words to the depressed and griefstricken ascetic sita surrounded by demon guards
on seeing me sita you want to conceal your thighs belly and breasts through fear of me i think you do not want me to see you
o largeeyed one you are endowed with beauty in all limbs you are the delight of all worlds i desire you dear oblige me
o sita no human or demon who can take any form at their will can relieve your fear born of me
o timid lady having an unrighteous approach to wives of others or their abduction by force is natural to demons there is no doubt
mythili let passion hold its sway over my body as it will but i shall not force you or touch you since you do not love me
o reverend lady fear not me on that account have confidence in me show your love do not be swayed by grief
o lady to wear a single braid sleep on the ground brooding wearing soiled clothes and fasting without proper occasion does not suit you
o mythili having secured me you get all these comforts wonderful garlands sandal incense garments and beautiful ornaments rich drinks beds and seatsyou can enjoy songs dances accompanied by musical instruments
you are a a jewel among women you should not remain like this you should adorn yourself properly how can you remain deprived after having me
your charming youth should not pass away uselessly a past event does not come back like a current of stream
o lady with auspicious looks me thinks the creator must have retired after creating your beautiful form for there is no one comparable to you in beauty
o vaidehi you have extraordinary beauty and exuberant youth who would not lose his balance of mind even if he were brahma the grandsire himself after getting you
o one with a face like the cool fullmoon with heavy hips i am unable to extricate my eyes from any limb of your body i see
o mythili be my wife give up this folly due to delusion be my chief consort among the several excellent women i have picked up here and there be blessed
o timid lady gems brought forcibly from all the worlds this kingdom as well as myself are yours
o lovely lady i will win all the cities and lands and give them to janaka for your sake
im unrivalled in this entire world behold my matchless virility which permits no rival in war
the gods and demons were unable to withstand my power in wars fought against me they were often shattered and defeated with their flags crushed in war
offer your love to me get yourself decorated in an excellent way wear glowing ornaments on your limbs let me see you in pleasingly decorated form
o charming lady decorate yourself liberally enjoy these pleasures as you please drink and make merry
give away land and wealth as you wish enjoy with me freely and command me boldly i will obey you by all means
o blessed lady see my affluence and my fame seeing you enjoy life by my grace all your kinsmen will follow
o beautiful lady rama has renounced victory he has lost his fortune clad in bark he is wandering in the forest following asceticism and sleeping on the ground what can he do for you i am in doubt if he is alive or not
o vaidehi i wonder if rama can see you at all you are like moonlight veiled by dark clouds and cannot be seen even by the flying cranes
surely raghava will not be able to win you back from my hands any more than the demon hiranyakasipu was able to usurp the fame of indra
o lovely timid lady your smile your teeth and your eyes are bewitching just as garuda snatches away a serpent you ravish my mind by your beauty
even when you are attired in soiled silk and are bereft of ornaments i find no interest in my own wives
o janaki there are a number of virtuous consorts residing in the harem of my royal palace you may exercise your authority on all of them
o sita of heavy hips and beautiful brows be happy enjoy all the worlds of mine the gems and wealth of ravana
o queen rama is not equal to me either in penance or prowess or valour or wealth or brilliance or even in fame
o delightful one i will bestow you with heaps of riches and land therefore enjoy with me drinking sporting and revelling accept me and be happy to sport with melet your elatives join you and enjoy all my wealth
o timid lady embellish yourself with necklaces of pure gold and enjoy with me in the enchanting seaside forest groves full of trees with blossoms and swarming bees     thus ends the twentieth sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
on hearing the demons haughty words oppressed pitiable sita replied slowly in a sorrowful tone
sita austere beautiful and chaste afflicted by grief kept sobbing brooding over her husband and trembling in fear she placed a blade of grass in between her and ravana and replied with a gentle smile on her face
turn your mind away from me and fix it on your wives you should not expect to seek me just as a sinner cannot hope to seek blessedness
i was born of high lineage and joined a meritorious family by virtue of my marriage i am devoted only to my husband i should not commit this contemptible forbidden act
glorious vaidehi having thus spoken to the demon turned her back and continued
i cannot be your lawful wife obtainable by your personal efforts i am a chaste woman married to another man being a king examine the dharma honestly and adopt a pious way of life
o nightranger enjoy your wives take care of them taking your example others wives also deserve to be protected
the wives of others will insult an evilminded man who is not satisfied with his own wives is fickleminded and has no control over his senses
you are indulging in unrighteous act and not listening to the advice of wise men who have a sense of discrimination you are the cause of the destruction of demons
even prosperous countries and cities are destroyed on account of indiscreet rulers engaged in unfair means
having got you as its ruler this lanka filled with gems riches will perish without delay for the crime of one individual
o ravana living beings will welcome and enjoy the destruction of a shortsighted sinner killed by his own vile act
seeing you getting ruined this way for your sin those who were angry with you for their humiliation in your hands will feel glad and say luckily this terrible fellow has met with his doom
i cannot be lured by your power or wealth i am inseparable from raghava like light from the sun
how can i pillow on somebodys arm after resting on the honourable arm of the great lord of the worlds
i am alone the lawful wife of the lord of the earth like the knowledge of the vedas which rightfully belongs to a wise brahmin who has realised the self after having had his ceremonial bath as a token of celibacy and having observed strict vows during the period of his study
o ravana it is proper for you to unite me in distress with rama as one would unite a female elephant with the lordly elephant from which it is separated in the wilderness
i wish you to build friendship with rama the bull among men surely it is the right thing for you to do if you are desirous of avoiding a dreadful death
he is famous as a knower of dharma and is compassionate to those who seek his protection if you desire to preserve your life build friendship with him
propitiate him he is compassionate to those who seek refuge exercise control over your senses for your sake and it is proper for you to return me to him
it is good for you to give me back to rama the foremost in the raghu dynasty otherwise you will face death
you will hear the terrible twang of ramas bow resembling the rumble of the thunderbolt released by indra who performed a hundred yajnas
the shafts bound with feathers of kanka birds released by rama and lakshmana will be killing the demons all over this lanka they will not give a chance for any other weapon to fall
just as garuda swiftly extirpates the serpents rama will exterminate the demon leaders
my husband the subduer of enemies will soon take me away just as lord visnu in the form of vamana took away the glowing prosperity from the demons with three strides
when the army of demons as killed you had no capacity to protect and was destroyed at janasthana the place of death you acted in this dishonest way
you are a mean creature finding me in the vacant hut when the two brothers lions among men were away you abducted me
had you smelt the presence of rama and lakshmna it would not have been possible for you to stand there like a dog under the gaze of a pair of tigers
you will not be able to withstand them in a battle you will meet the same fate as the onearmed vritra in a battle with the twoarmed indra
my lord rama accompanied by saumitri will draw out your life by his arrows swiftly as aditya sucks up shallow water at once by his radiance
even if you fly to kuberas mountain kailasa or the residence of king varuna ocean you will not escape ramas arrows like a mighty tree cannot evade lightning     thus ends the twentyfirst sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
hearing the sharp words of pleasing sita the lord of demons replied in unpleasant terms
the more the lover is courteous and loving and pleasing to women the more he is humiliated by them
my love for you has restrained my anger just as a good charioteer controls the horses galloping on a wrong path
love is partial it gets bound to those in whomsoever compassion and friendship is generated even though they are punishable
o beautiful one it is on this account that i do not kill you even though you deserve to be killed and insulted for the words used even as you are engaged in a pseudoascetic life
o mythili for each of the piercing statements made you deserve dreadful death
ravana the lord of demons said these words in reply to vaidehi who was overcome with anger and exitement
i shall wait for two months the deadline fixed o lady of beautiful hue thereafter you have to share my bed
if you are still reluctant to accept me as your husband after two months you will be sent to kitchen to be cooked as morning breakfast for me
observing janaki threatened by the demon king the daughters of gods and gandharvas shed tears with distressful eyes
when sita was threatened by the demon king the daughters of gods and gandharvas there consoled her through gestures of their lips and eyes
having thus been consoled sita proud of the power of her virtues said this to ravana in selfdefence
obviously there is no one among your people keen on your welfare since nobody is preventing you from this reproachable act
who in all the three worlds other than you would even in mind seek this consort of the righteous self sri rama like sachi to indra
o stupid demon where can you go to escape the consequences of your sinful words spoken against ramas consort of undimmed brilliance
it is like a proud elephant fighting in war with a rabbit rama is like an elephant and you are like an ordinary rabbit people speak of
you are not ashamed of belittling rama in his absence you have not yet walked into his sight
o ignoble wretch i wonder why your dark brown distorted eyes do not fall off the socket when you look at me lustfully
why does not your tongue drop down while you speak such words against this consort of the righteous king rama and daughterin law of dasaratha
o ravana i can reduce you to ashes through the fire of my chastity but i do not have ramas permission and i want to preserve my power of ascetism even though you are fit to be consigned to the flames
when i was with wise rama it was not possible for you to abduct me no doubt providence has ordained this to bring about your death
you are a great warrior and a brother of kubera you possess an army then why did you abduct ramas wife bypassing him
on hearing janaki the lord of demons ravana looked at her with his cruel eyes opened wide and rolling
prosperous ravana looked like a mass of dark cloud with strong arms stout neck gait of a lion a blazing tongue and burning eyes
he appeared taller with an unsteady crown he was wearing wonderful red flower garlands and clothes and was smeared with unguents shining in ornamental armlets
wrapped well with a big black thread around his hips he appeared like mount mandara encompassed by a black serpent at the time of churning the milkocean for nectar
the lord of demons shone like mount mandara both his long two arms like two mountain peaks
he stood like a mountain with two ashoka trees clothed with red leaves and flowers in the form of earrings of the colour of the rising sun
he was comparable to the wishfulfilling tree grown in heaven a personified spring season and a memorial structure raised on the cremation ground he looked frightening even though welladorned
looking at vaidehi eyes red with anger and breathing heavily like a histing snake ravana replied
o sita you are following a vow of chastity and treading a meaningless wrong path i will destroy you as the sun dispels the morning twilight with his lustre
king ravana a tormentor of enemies having thus threatened mythili commanded the shedemons women of fiecrceful appearance as follows
of them one had one eye the other one ear another with ears covered one had the ear of a cow another had ears of an elephant and yet another long hanging ears one had the feet of an elephant another hoofs of a horse and still another of a cow while one had a single foot another had broad feet and yet another no feet at all one had a long neck and a large head one had large breasts and belly one had a big face and eyes another had a long tongue and yet another no tongue at all one had no nose and still another had a lion face and yet another the face of a cow
o demonesses all of you jointly dispose janaki towards me see that she submits to me at once
by adopting means favourable or contrary to her will or through persuasion or coercion or through reward or punishment draw vaidehis mind towards me said ravana
the demon king repeatedly commanded the ogresses burning in anger and passion and threatened sita again and again pointing his finger at her
an ogress called dhanyamalini at once approached the tenheaded ravana and embracing him said
o king of demons sport with me my lord what purpose will be served with this pale wretched sita a human being after all
o king surely she is not ordained by brahma the foremost among the immortals to enjoy the luxuries earned by the strength of your arms
having heard her words the demon king who resembled a fierce dark cloud turned away laughing heartily
thereupon the tennecked demon departed as if he was shaking the earth and entered his residence which was shining like the blazing midday sun
then the daughters of gods gandharvas and nagas gathered round and followed him into his excellent palace
having derided mythili trembling in fear yet steadfast in treading the righteous path ravana overpowered with passion left her and entered his glittering mansion     thus ends twentysecond sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
king ravana tormentor of enemies having thus spoken to mythili commanded the demonesses and departed
as the demon king left for his abode all the demonesses of hideous looks rushed towards sita and crowded around her
the demonesses overcome with anger approached sita and harshly said
o sita dont you think it is a privilege to be the wife of the highsouled tennecked ravana who is the distinguished king of a high family of sage paulastya
then ekajata a shedemon of hideous looks eyes red with anger and a belly of the size of the palm said to sita
the mindborn son of brahma is well known as paulastya he was the fourth among the six prajapatis maricha atri angira pulastya plaha kratu
this glorious mindborn sage pulastyas son is the famous vishrava who in glory and splendour was equal to prajapatis
o largeeyes lady to become the wife of the lord of demons is a stroke of good luck you deserve to be one o lady of beautiful limbs why dont you accept his proposal
then an ogress called harijata said this in anger her cateyes rolling
you ought to be the wife of the lord of ogres who has vanquished thirty three crores of gods including indra their king
then an ogress named praghasa overwhelmed with anger deriding sita said these terrible words
why dont you wish to be the wife of such a mighty and powerful king a valiant hero who has never beaten a retreat in war
even renouncing his highly respectable favourite wife among all mighty ravana is prepared to accept you
ravana is prepared to abandon a thousand wives in his prosperous harem decorated with all kinds of gems in order to accept you
another ogress called vikata said know that he who has often defeated gods in war and has vanquished nagas gandharvas and demons has come to you seeking your favour
o foolish woman why dont you seek the wifehood of a glorious king of demons who has abundance of wealth
then an ogress called durmukhi said o lady of long sideglances why dont you yield to him afraid of whom the sun scorches not and strong winds blow not
o lady of beautiful brows why dont you make up your mind to accept the king of kings afraid of whom the trees rain flowers the mountains and clouds release water at his will ravana is the king of the southwest direction why dont you wish to be his wife
then the hideous ogresses approached sita and spoke these harsh words in an unbecoming manner
o sita why dont you agree to dwell in ravanas inner apartment furnished with fine bedsteads and which is delightful
you are a woman wife of rama an ordinary mortal you are holding in high esteem withdraw your mind from rama or else you will not survive
o charming lady you have an irreproachable beauty and grace why do you think of human rama only who has been dethroned from the kingdom he is only a human being who is unsuccessful and distressful
hearing the words of the ogresses sita with eyes like lotus petals full of tears replied this way
dejected or dethroned from the kingdom rama is my lawful husband i will ever remain devoted to rama as suvarchala wife of the sungod is to him
i am steadfast in love to my husband rama the foremost of the ikshvaku family in the same manner as noble sachi to indra arundhati to vasistha rohini to the moon lopamudra to agastya sukanya to sage chyavana savitri to satyavan srimati to kapilamuni madayanti to soudasu kesini to king sagara and bhimas daughter damayanti to her lord nala the king of nishadas
hearing the reply of sita the ogresses ordered by ravana and overtaken by anger again began to threaten sita using harsh words
hanuman who kept himself concealed on the simsupa tree speechlessly listened to the ogresses threatening sita
sita was trembling in fear the enraged ogresses went on licking their lips hanging again and again
the enraged ogresses immediately picked up the axes and rose up saying she is unfit to have the demon king ravana as her husband
as the charming sita was threatened by the fierce ogresses she moved towards the simsupa tree with eyes full of tears
then the largeeyed sita drowned in sorrow surrounded by the ogresses went near the simsupa tree and stood there
the ogresses started intimidating sita who was dressed in soiled clothes and emaciated with a dejected look on her face
then a dark ogress called vinata with a terryfying look loathsome appearance and a large sunken belly said to sita
o sita you have shown your love for your husband to this extent it is enough o auspicious lady anything carried to excess leads to adversity
o mythili i beseech you to oblige ravana you have discharged your duty as a human being be happy but you should also heed my advice which is after all salutary
leave the helpless human rama and seek ravanas refuge o vaidehi using the heavenly unguents and adorned with imposing ornaments from now on be the queen of all people
o beautiful sita just like swaha queen to the firegod and sachi to indra accept ravana why are you still thinking of rama who is helpless and whose life span is coming to an end soon
if you do not heed our words of advice all of us will eat you at this very moment
now vikata another ogress with hanging breasts raised her fist up in anger and roared at sita
o wicked mythili we have tolerated many unpleasant words uttered by you due to our kindness and mildness
o mythili you have heeded not our good and timely advice tendered in your interest you have been brought to the other shore of the ocean and to the inner chambers of ravana which is very difficult for others to access
you are in ravanas house wellguarded by us it is not possible even for indra destroyer of citadels to come to your rescue let alone rama
mythili act according to our advice i am your wellwisher give up sorrow and stop shedding useless tears
o sita offer your love to ravana adore him and be happy give up this continuous dejection enjoy all pleasures along with the king of demons
o timid sita know that youth of women is fleeting and transient before it is over enjoy all kinds of pleasures
o lady of intoxicating eyes range in the company of the demon king the delightful gardens and mountain ranges filled with gardens
o beautiful sita seven thousand ogresses will be at your beck and call therefore accept ravana the lord of all ogres as your husband
o mythili if you heed not my words of advice i will pluck out your heart and eat it up
next spoke a fiercelooking ogress called chandodari overcome with anger taking up a huge trident and rotating
i have developed a morbid desire to feast upon this woman with eyes flashing like does whose breasts heave with stress and fear after she was abducted by ravana
i thought of feasting on your spleen liver heart all the joints head and intestines
next spoke an ogress called praghasa saying why not we twist and squeeze the neck of this heartless lady why are you sitting idle still come on
thereafter we will announce that such a human being is dead then ravana will simply say eat her up there is no doubt
then an ogress called ajamukhi said let her body be cut into lumps of equal pieces
we shall share them i do not like disputes in this regard go swiftly and get drinks and food to lick let the accompanying dishes of all variety and quality be brought
then an ogress called surpanakha said i too like the proposal of ajamukhi
get the wine quickly destroyer of all sorrows after relishing the human flesh we will start nikumbhila dance
threatened by the ogresses in that manner sita who was like the daughter of a god cried aloud     thus ends the twentyfourth sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
on hearing the many harsh words of dire threat by the ugly ogresses the daughter of janaka wept
in reply to the ogresses who thus spoke noble vaidehi terribly frightened said in a voice choked with tears
surrounded by the ogresses distressed sita who was like the daughter of a divine did not get any solace
like a doe that strayed from the herd in the forest and tormented by wolves around sita had withdrawn into herself all her limbs through fear she was trembling excessively
laying hold on a large blossoming branch of the ashoka tree sita thought of her husband with a broken heart
her large breasts bathed with the flow of tears she continued to brood over her plight and found no end to it
trembling like a banana tree uprooted by the stormy wind sita who was seized with fear of the ogresses looked pale and desperate
the long luxuriant braid of hair of the trembling sita waving in the wind appeared like a crawling female serpent
the distressed mythili her consciousness drowned in grief sighing shed streams of tears
the bright beautiful sita began to wail alas rama alas lakshmana alas my motherinlaw kausalya alas sumitra
there is a famous popular saying among the learned that untimely death is not possible either for a woman or a manit is true that i am living in this miserable condition deprived of ramas company and tormented by these cruel ogresses here living in such conditions even for a moment is impossible but nobody dies an untimely death
i am a woman of low merit a wretched woman an orphan i will be ruined like the loaded boat that gets hit in the midst of the ocean by the stormy wind
unable to find my husband and seized by these ogresses i am collapsing on account of grief like a riverbank under the current of water
blessed are those who are in touch with my husband with eyes like lotus petals whose walk is majestic like a lions who has a sense of gratitude and is pleasing in words
separated from rama endowed with selfknowledge it is impossible for me to live like one who has drunk venom
i do not know what great sin i have committed in my past life for which i experience this terrific cruel affliction
i long to give up my life afflicted with great grief as i wellguarded by these ogresses have no hope to reach rama
fie upon this human life fie upon this dependence what a pitiable situation i am placed in it is not possible for me a human to give up life at my free will      thus ends the twentyfifth sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
the young daughter of king janaka thus speaking began to cry her face bent down
bewildered or distracted or intoxicated this young lady wailed wallowing round on the ground like a young female horse
when rama was engaged in deer hunt and i was screaming i was brought forcibly by ravana who can assume any form at his will
having fallen under the clutches of the dreadful demonesses and threatened by them i am so full of woes and worries that i dont want to live
in the absence of the great charioteer rama of what use is my living in the midst of ogresses i need no wealth no ornaments
it may be that my heart is made of stone or it has no age or death since it does not riven even with grief
i am preserving this sinful life like this though separated from rama fie on me for this wretched infidel life
how can i have interest in any kind of pleasure without my sweettongued husband the lord of the whole earth extending up to the ocean
i will give up my body break me into pieces or eat me up i cannot bear the sorrow of separation from my dear rama any longer
i will not even touch that vile nightranger ravana with my left foot what to speak of loving him
even if i am cut broken to pieces or burnt in glowing fire i will not accept ravana why do you shout for so long
rama is renowned wise grateful and kindly it is due to my misfortune that he has turned pitiless to me there is no doubt
he who destroyed fourteen thousand demons singlehanded has not come to protect me i do not know why
rama my husband for sure is capable of killing in battle this ravana who has held me captive and who is a demon of inferior valour
why is rama who killed viradha a bull among demons in dandaka forest in the fight not coming to rescue me
this lanka in the middle of the ocean is unassailable but there is nothing which can resist the arrows of rama
what may be the reason that my loving husband rama who is highly powerful has not reached this place to which i was abducted by the demon
the elder brother of lakshamana does not know that i am here or im afraid the glorious rama knows and yet tolerates such an outrageous act
even the king of vultures knows i was borne away he could have informed rama but he has also been thrashed down on the earth by ravana in the fight
though old jatayu did a great help to me by resisting ravana in the duel and advancing to confront him
had only raghava known that i was here he would have freed this world of demons with his anger
had rama known that i am in lanka he would have blown up this city dried up the ocean and destroyed the name and fame of the mean ravana
like me weeping the cry of ogresses with lost husbands will be heard in every house in lanka there is no doubt
if only lakshmana and rama in their quest for lanka reach here it is not possible within their sight for the enemy to survive even a moment
very soon this lanka will be enveloped with smoke from funeral pyres and thronged with flocks of vultures moving in circles it will be like a burial ground
your bad behaviour forebodes illluck for youi shall have my desire fulfilled in a short time
inauspicious signs are seen here in lanka in a short time this city will lose its splendour
surely this impregnable lanka will wither up lose its splendour and appear like a widow when this sinful ravana a mean demon is killed
this city of lanka with many auspicious celebrations will lose its king and all mean ogresses will remain like widows
i shall surely hear very soon sounds of distressful cry of young ogresses in every household
totally burnt by ramas arrows this lanka will be filled with darkness and its splendour lost and preeminent demons destroyed
if the heroic rama of bloodshot eyes comes to know that i am here at ravanas the expiry of time limit fixed by this cruel lowly foolish ravana has arrived this wicked fellows death is inevitable
nothing is forbidden for sinful demons a calamity will befall now due to this adharma the flesheating ogres are aware of neither dharma nor adharma
this demon is determined to make me his morning meal how can i do anything in the absence of my lord of pleasing countenance i am distressed very much by not seeing rama possessed of eyes with a reddish tinge in the corners
neither lakshmana nor his elder brother knows that i am here alive had they known both of them would have ransacked this earth
would it be that the heroic elder brother of lakshmana has gone to the abode of gods unable to find me on this earth
blessed are the gods gandharvas and siddhas and great sages who are able to see my lotuseyed lord rama
or that royal sage wise rama who always seeks dharma having become one with the supreme spirit has no longer any interest in me
love attaches itself to one who remains before ones eyesfriendship fades with separation the ungrateful destroy love and friendship as their love is conditioned by frequent meetings but it cannot happen in case of rama
do i a charming lady not have any good fortune because of my past deeds i wonder how a foremost woman like me seperated from my husband is sinking in grief without rama has my fortune diminished
instead of living separated from noble and brave rama a blemishless character and a destroyer of enemies it is better for me to die
may be both the brothers foremost among men have laid down their arms and taken to asceticism subsisting on roots and fruits
or else has this wicked demon king slain both the brothers rama and lakshmana by some deceptive means
by all means i wish to die in these circumstances however death is not ordained for me even in this sorrowful state
blessed are the exhalted sages who have not committed any sin they have selfcontrol and have subdued their senses there is no pleasure or displeasure for them
salutations to those exalted souls who have distanced themselves from pleasure and displeasure pleasures may not lead to suffering or displeasure to excessive meaningless fear for such great souls
separated from the wise rama who deserves pleasant things i will give up life being under the clutches of the sinful ravana      thus ends the twentysixth sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
hearing sitas words some terrifying demonesses overwhelmed with anger went to inform ravana who was quick to act
the dreadfullooking demonesses once again approached sita and conveyed her categorically in harsh words the terrible consequences ahead
o vile one you are determined in your evil ways today these shedemons will eat away your flesh to their hearts content
then seeing the ignoble shedemons threatening sita an old demoness called trijata who was lying down there said
devour yourselves now o ignoble ones if you will do not eat janakas favourite daughter the daughterinlaw of dasaratha
tonight i had a terrific horriplating nightmare in which i saw the annihilation of all demons and the triumph of sitas husband
o trijata tell us the kind of dream you dreamt last night they insisted hearing the words from the mouth of the shedemons trijata told them all about her dream
rama in white attire wearing a garland of white flowers ascending a palanquin made of ivory drawn by a thousand swans and coursing through the sky with lakshmana arrived
i also saw sita in my dream wearing white robes and perched on a white mountain surrounded by the ocean
just as light is united with the sun i saw sita united with rama i saw rama with lakshmana riding a huge mountainlike elephant having four tusks
dressed in white garlands and clothes the two brothers tigers among men glowing in their effulgence approached janaki
then from the front of the mountain janaki shifted to the back of the elephant held by her husband waiting in the sky
then i saw the lotuseyed sita springing up from the lap of her husband and playfully caressing the moon and sun with her palms
then the excellent elephant was seen halted in the city of lanka with both princes and the largeeyed sita mounted on the elephant
rama accompanied by his wife sita came on a chariot yoked to eight white oxen
valiant rama foremost among men accompanied by his brother lakshmana and wife sita went towards the northerly direction in the wonderful pushpaka chariot that resembled the sun
in this way i saw in my dream rama as valiant as lord visnu accompanied by his brother lakshmana and his wife sita
just as a sinner cannot attain heaven rama cannot be won by gods or demons even rakshasas and others
i saw the body of ravana lying on the ground smeared with oil clad in red wearing a garland of lilies and intoxicated with drinking
tonight i saw in another dream ravana with shaven head clad in black clothes fallen down on the ground from the pushpaka chariot being dragged by a woman
he was wearing red garlands and unguents his body smeared with oil he was drinking laughing and dancing his mind and senses perplexed he was driving on a chariot yoked to donkeys
i saw the demon king ravana running behind the chariot driven by donkeys in the southerly direction he was falling with his head bent down and deluded by the fear of the donkey
i saw ravana getting up quickly in a bewildered state terrorstricken totally confused in intoxication he had gone almost insane naked uttering words of abuse plunged into a pool of filth and emitting foul smell he disappeared into a helllike dark chamber
there i saw the nightranger kumbhakarna and also ravanas sons their bodies smeared with oil
the tennecked ravana was seen this time riding on a boar indrajit on a crocodile and kumbhakarna on a camel all set towards the southerly direction
only vibhishana was under a white umbrella clad in white with white garlands and white sandal paste
hailed by the sounds of conches and drums and of musicians and dancers vibhishana was seen ascending on to a decorated fourtust elephant which was huge like a mountain and trumpting like a thundering cloud he stood there along with four ministers and reached the aerial region
i saw this delightful lanka teeming with horses chariots and elephants archways and towers crumbling and falling into the ocean
in my dream i saw this city of lanka protected by ravana burnt down by a powerful vanara a messenger of rama
kumbhakarna and other demon leaders wearing red clothes entered into a pool of cow dung
therefore go away from here you will be totally destroyed by rama who will secure his wife and will kill all of you along with others in great anger
rama will not approve of any one abusing or threatening his venerable beloved wife who had led a life of exile with him
give up these cruel taunts speak to her in a cordial manner we will beg vaidehis forgiveness i like this kind of action
when any demoness in a sorrowful state dreams this kind of dream she will be relieved of sorrow and will obtain supreme joy
o demonesses beg her pardon now even though you had threatened her earlier where is the need to hesitate there is cause for concern for demons from rama
o shedemons this janakas daughter from mithila who is capable of protecting you against great dangers will be pleased by your submission
look at the signs on her body there is not a little inauspiciousness in the limbs of the largeeyed princess from mithila
i see the day of fulfilment for vaidehi has drawn near i can also foresee the destruction of the demon king and the triumph of rama
this dream indeed served as an augery for good news about her look her left eye which is large like a lotus petal is throbbing
the left shoulder of this great vaidehi has started suddenly throbbing indicating that she is feeling a bit happy
her excellent left thigh comparable to a female elephants trunk is trembling as though indicating that rama is standing in her presence
one can see the bird which utters excellent sweet notes indicating happy tidings entering again and again the foliage of the tree a delightful bird as if prompting sita again and again to rejoice     thus ends the twentyseventh sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
after hearing the unpleasant words spoken by the king of demons which caused restlessness and sorrow to sita she was terrified like the young calf of a lordly elephant fallen into the clutches of a lion in the midst of the forest
encircled by the demonesses sita was repeatedly humiliated by ravanas cruel words she wept like a young girl deserted in a desolate forest
even though i am threatened like this i am living pitiably because of lack of merit indeed i regret my survival due to my bad luck elders say that death will not ocurr before its time it seems to be true
even though i am devoid of joy and living in deep agony my heart bursts not into a thousand pieces like the summit of a mountain hit by thunderbolt lightning
i will not be blamed if i commit suicide nowi stand condemned to death in the hands of this ugly ravana i cannot bestow my affection on him or surender to his desire like a brahmin would not like to impart vedic knowledge to a nonbrahmin better die of my own accord than be killed by a sinful ogre
if the lord of the world does not come here before that time fixed by ravana the vile lord of demons will cut me into pieces with weapons just as a barber would cut to pieces the foetus with a sharp knife in order to save a pregnant woman
just like two mighty lions are killed by a bolt of lightning the two princes must have been killed by a creature in the guise of a deer on my account
verily it is the spirit of the time that assumed the form of deer and tempted this unfortunate soul it was foolish of me to send away the sons of a noble king lakshmana and his elder brother
i am devoted to you and to no other god my hardship in sleeping on the ground my righteousness my discipline and chastity have all proved futile like the devotion of an ungrateful person
this righteousnes practised by me is in vain like my devotion to you as i am unable to see you i am a separated emaciated pale with no hope of reuniting with you
having truly fulfilled your pledge given to your father you will return from the forest to ayodhya rid of all fear as an accomplished person will and revel in the company of largeeyed damsels i think
o ramai loved you and concentrated all my love on you for a long time only for my doom i have observed vows and austerities in vain i cannot continue it for long here i am giving up my life fie upon this luckless one me
i will end my life at once by taking poison or else by a sharp weapon alas there is none to give get me poison or a weapon at this demons residence
queen sita was wailing in many ways constantly remembering rama the soul of all shivering her face pales as she approached the great simsupa tree in bloom
burning in grief worrying in many ways sita took hold of her braid and said by tying myself with this braid i shall quickly reach the presence of the lord of death
sita of delicate limbs approached the simsupa tree and held on to a branch and stood while she was thinking of rama and lakshmana and their noble family many omens of proven results appeared on her auspicious charming body these omens were dispellers of grief and harbingers of courage in the world as declared from ancient times now they manifested themselves     thus ends the twentyeigth sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
like wellwishers flocking round a person on whom fortune is smiling omens foretelling auspicious happenings in near future appeared to sita she was unimpeachable she was in agony distressed in mind bereft of all joy now standing under that simsupa tree
her left eye with a row of curved eyelashes the black pupils of the eye in white throbbed in an auspicious manner the lady with her long tresses and throbbing eye appeared like a red lotus gently struck by a fish
her stout left arm curved beautifully fit for excellent agaru and sandal paste once the pillow by her beloved lord for long throbbed suddenly
again her roundshaped left thigh resembling an elephants trunk started throbbing presaging union with rama
her eyes were pristine teeth wellshaped the goldhued auspicious sari on her charming limbs was now a little soiled on account of dust it slipped slightly as she stood up this augured well for her
reassured by such omens which augured well as tested by time sita with beautiful eyebrows and deep foresight experienced great joy like a seed blighted by the wind and the sun comes back to joyful life through a pleasing shower a foreteller is addressed as siddha in sanskrit dramas
her face shining with beautiful red lips like bimba fruit sparkling teeth and curved eyelashes with lovely brows extending up to her hair she appeared like a moon released from the mouth of rahu
revered sita completely relieved of grief exhaustion gone fears allayed mind illumined with joy looked charming with her countenance as a night with the moon fully risen during the bright fortnight     thus ends the twentyninth sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic compsed by sage valmiki
the valiant hero hanuman heard everything including the lamentation of sita and the dream of trijata and the threats of the demonesses
the sight of sita who seemed a deity in the nandana garden of indra set a chain of reflections in his mind
this is sita whom thousands of vanaras are searching in all directions
roaming everywhere incognito to ascertain carefully the strength of the enemy i have seen everything
i have seen the ability of the demons and the citadel of lanka i have seen the power of ravana the demon king
it is the opportune time for me to comfort sita eagerly waiting to see her husband who is of immeasurable prowess and who is compassionate to all beings
the moonfaced sita had never experienced sorrow before she sees no end to her sorrow and suffering i will console her
if i should return to kishkindha without reassuring sita whose understanding has been clouded in grief i would be blamed
if i so back this illustrious princess janaki will give up her life finding no means of deliverance from this tragic situation
i should provide some comfort to the strongarmed rama with a face like the fullmoon yearning to see sita
i cannot talk to her in the presence of these nightroamers how can i discharge my duty in this predicament
if i do not comfort her before the remaining part of the night ends she will give up her life there is no doubt about it
if rama enquires about the message of sita this lady of beautiful waist what can i speak without meeting and talking to her
if i leave this place without any message from sita rama will burn me with his eyes full of great anger
if i get the lord of vanaras and his army for the cause of rama without talking to sita their arrival will be useless if sita would have given up her life by then
i shall wait and speak to her slowly and console this deeply distressed lady when i get a chance to speak to her when these ogresses are asleep
i am indeed of small size and that too a monkey nevertheless i shall speak in sanskrit a language of the common people as the shedemons cannot understand that language
if i speak like a brahmin in sanskrit language she would be frightened thinking that i am ravana and how would a vanara speak
i will certainly speak to her meaningfully in the language of the people otherwise it is not possible to pacify the sinless sita
since janaki has already been frightened by the demons she will be even more terrified seeing me in this form and hearing me speaking this way
by seeing me in this form sensitive largeeyed sita will scream loudly thinking that i am ravana who can assume any form at his free will
if sita screams the horde of terrific ogresses will at once gather armed with dreadful weapons like yama the god of death
then all these hideous ogresses will swarm round me and make efforts to capture me with all their strength and kill me
seeing me holding big and small branches of large trees and leaping from one place to the other the ogresses will get scared
these ogresses with their hideous faces will be frightened on looking at my huge form moving in this grove
thereafter the ogresses will draw the attention of demon guards engaged by the king of demons at his residence towards me
those ogresses due to fear will come speedily armed with spears tridents swords and different kinds of weapons for a combat
with them around me i may not be able to reach the other end of the ocean my strength spent in the combat
the ogres who are in large numbers here are very prompt to act they will jump into the sky and bind me sita will not receive the message and i will be taken into custody by the demons
these demons who are keen on indulging in violence will harm janakas daughter then the mission of rama and sugriva will also fail
janaki is staying in this untraceable location surrounded by demons and this location is a secret place surrounded by the ocean
if i am killed in the combat or captured by the demons i do not see another person who can help in accomplishing this task
when i am killed here i cannot see any other vanara who can leap over a hundred yojanas of the ocean to reach this place
i may be capable of killing even thousands of demons but thereafter thoroughly exhausted reach the other side of the ocean
battles no doubt are unpredictable which wise man with a sound intellect will take up a doubtful work unhesitatingly
if i talk to vaidehi it will be a great mistake on my partif i do not speak to vaidehi she may give up her life
even well planned diplomatic missions fail like darkness dispelled at sunrise if the messenger is confused and if the place and time are not propitious for them
swinging from a course of action or an action leading to calamity is not proper messengers who assume that they are scholars blinded by ego destroy their mission
how can the mission succeed how can failure of mission be avoided how can the crossing of the great ocean be not wasted
wise hanuman came to a decision after reflecting in his mind about how not to create fear in sita while communicating with her
by praising rama who is very dear who is judicious in action and in whom her mind is absorbed i will not create fear
i shall present in auspicious words the esteemed rama of ikshvaku family who is a knower of self and make her listen to everything in such a sweet manner that she will trust me
highsouled hanuman seated on the branch of the tree without being seen began to speak faithfully in praise of the lord of the universe in many ways while looking at her      thus ends the thirtieth sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
after deliberating in several ways the great hanuman spoke these sweet words to vaidehi
there was an illustrious king called dasaratha in ikshvaku race a master of chariots elephants and horses he was highly meritorious and renowned
he was the most virtuous among royal sages equal to sages in austerity born in the race of emperors and equal to indra in might
he was committed to nonviolence magnanimous compassionate and one whose strength was truth he was not only a prosperous king of ikshvaku family but also a promoter of prosperity of others too
endowed with signs of kingship and vast wealth he was a bull among rulers of the vast earth surrounded by the sea a happy king himself he was wellknown as a provider of happiness
his beloved eldest son rama whose countenance is like the full moon is a scholar of all branches of knowledge and is foremost among the bowmen on earth
the scourage of enemies he is a protector of righteousness and of his kins and all living creatures he is an embodiment of righteousness
honouring the word of his aged father who was ever steadfast in truth rama left for the forest along with his wife and brother
in the deep forest he went round hunting animals and killing the demon warriors who assumed any form at their free will
ravana having heard about the killing of all demons at janasthana including khara and dooshana in the forest deceived rama in the guise of a deer and abducted janaki in anger
while looking for the goddesslike lady the sinless sita in the forest rama met a monkey called sugriva and made friendship with him
rama a powerful king who can win enemy forts killed vali and offered the monkey kingdom to sugriva
having received sugrivas orders thousands of monkeys who can assume any form went searching for that divine queen in all directions
on hearing the words of sampati i leaped the wide ocean swiftly crossing a hundred yojanas in quest of the largeeyed sita
surely i have seen here a lady of similar body of similar complexion of similar glow and beauty as described by rama
having spoken thus the great vanara stopped speaking after that janaki was wonderstruck by the words of the vanara
then sita looked up at the simsupa tree timidly her face covered with beautiful curly hair
on hearing hanumans words sita looked at all directions and quarters while quietly contemplating on rama the self of all and experienced supreme joy
she looked obliquely up and down and saw hanuman of unimaginable intelligence the minister of the monkey lord son of the windgod who looked like the rising sun     thus ends the thirtyfirst sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
sita got perplexed on seeing him hanuman who was tawny in complexion and looked like a cluster of lightnings clad in white and hidden in between the branches
there on the tree she noticed a monkey like a cluster of fully blossomed ashoka flower shining bright whose eyes were glowing like pure molten gold speaking softly and pleasingly
astonisted mythili began thinking oh this vanaras appearance is frightening he is terrible to look at he is inaccessible thinking over this again and again she fainted
overcome with sorrow and fear noble sita sobbed pitiably muttering repeatedly o rama o rama o lakshmana
noble sita seeing the best of vanaras who stood near humbly began reflecting is this a dream
looking here and there she saw a monkey with a large curved face an obedient servant and a minister of the monkeylord the foremost among the intelligentia and the son of the windgod
the largeeyed sita lost her senses looking at him she got back her senses after a long time and started thinking again
today i saw an ugly monkey in my dream its sight in a dream is inauspicious according to sastras let it be auspicious for lakshmana and rama for the sake of my father janaka
but no it was not a dream for tormented by grief and sorrow i cannot have a dream when separated from the moonfaced rama i have no sleep or pleasure how can i have dream
i am always meditating upon rama and thinking of him alone i am talking about things related to him because of that i see him and hear him
i am tormented by intense love for rama with all my thoughts immersed in him since i am constantly thinking of him i see him and hear words about him she thinks it is all hallucination
i feel it is only the desire in my mind desire has no form but the one who is addressing me has a form i cannot understand this
my salutations to indra brihaspati brahma the creator and also to the firegod let all those words spoken by the vanara here in front of me be true and not other than that     thus ends the thirtysecond sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
hanuman son of the windgod whose face shone like coral dressed in a sober manner climbed down the tree went close to sita offered salutations with his palms on his head and spoke in sweet words
o blameless lady with eyes like lotus petals in crumpled silk holding a branch and standing who are you
why are tears of grief flowing from your eyes like water trickling down a pair of petals of white lotuses
o noble lady are you a goddess or a demoness a naga a gandharva a rakshasa a yaksha or a kinnera
o beautiful lady do you belong to the race of rudras or marutas or vasus o noble lady you appear a goddess to me
o lady of lovely black eyes who are you have you by any chance offended your husband out of anger or out of delusion are you the auspicious arundhati dislodged for making your lord vasistha angry
o woman of beautiful waist from which world have you come here for whom are you worrying who is your son father brother or husband are you worrying about some one dead
from your weeping your sighing and your touching the earth gods do not touch the earth and your signs of sovereignty i do not think you are a goddess meaning otherwise she posessed divine grace
on the basis of your royal signs and other qualities i infer that you are the daughter of a king or his consort
if you are sita who was forcefully borne away by ravana from janasthana you may kindly reveal to me freely may god bless you
indeed your plight the superhuman beauty and your robes marked with asceticism surely tell me that you are ramas queen
happy to have heard words of praise of rama vaidehi spoke this to hanuman who got up the tree
i am daughterinlaw of king dasaratha knower of the self the foremost among kings on earth and a slayer of enemy army
i am daughter of the great soul janaka king of videha known as sita i am the wife of that sagacious rama
i enjoyed worldly pleasures in abundance for twelve years at ramas abode
then in the thirteenth year king dasaratha along with the royal preceptor arranged to coronate rama delight of the ikshvaku family in the kingdom
while preparations for the coronation were on queen kaikeyi said to her husband
i shall not drink or eat food if rama is coronated i shall end my life this moment
o dasaratha the foremost among kings if the promise lovingly made by you earlier is not going to be false rama should go to the forest
remembering the boons the ever truthful king had granted to kaikeyi he fainted after hearing her cruel and harsh words
the aged king who held on to truthfulness and righteousness begged his famed eldest son rama to return the kingdom
the illustrious rama who valued his fathers word more than sovereignty bowed to the command of the father
rama whose strength was his truthfulness gave whatever others sought but would not accept anything in return he would not speak a harsh word
having given up the kingdom voluntarily rama a highly renowned king cast off his luxurious upper garments and asked me to take care of his mother
i however resolved to live in the forest marched ahead of him quickly as i did not prefer even heaven without him
respecting the kings order and determined firmly we entered the impenetrable forest
while the most valiant rama was living in the dandaka forest i his wife was borne away by the evilminded ravana
he has allowed me two months time to live after two months i will have to give up my life     thus ends the thirtythird sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
hearing the words of sita who was overwhelmed with grief the monkey leader hanuman felt sad and thus spoke comforting her
by the command of rama i am here as a messenger he is keeping well he is well and wishes you well
o godlike lady rama son of dasaratha master of the vedas wielder of brahmastra wishes you well
the mighty lakshmana too a dear brother and follower of your husband is immersed in grief and sends salutations to you
on hearing the wellbeing of rama and lakshman lions among men sita experienced thrill all over her body she then spoke to hanuman
the adage that joy comes to a living being even though it be at the end of a hundred years is popular it appears true in my case
hanuman thus created a sense of wonderful joy in her as they came together both of them started to converse restoring confidence in each other
hearing the reply of sita who was crying piteously stricken with grief the monkey leader hanuman moved close to her
as hanuman started slowly drawing close sita suspected he might be ravana
ohshame on me i have told him my story which should not have been said this is verily ravana come in a disguise
so saying sita of flawless limbs emaciated with grief left the branch of ashoka tree held by her and squatted on the ground
the longarmed hanuman saw sita who was stricken with grief and deluded with fear he prostrated to her but out of fear she did not look at him
on seeing the vanara prostrated the moonfaced lady sighed deeply and spoke to him in a sweet voice
if you are that trickster ravana who appears incognito before me it is not good for you you are causing grief again
you are the same ravana who took the guise of a mendicant giving up your real form and came to janasthana
oh you are one who can assume any form at will you are a nightstalker it is not good for you to cause pain to me who is already emaciated through fasting who is pitiable and who is already afflicted
may be my suspicion is not correct because i am experiencing pleasure in my mind in your presence
o great vanara if on the other hand you have come here as ramas messenger i wish you well i love ramas story tell me
o vanara ramas virtues are dear to me to hear o gentle one just as the current of the river wears away its banks my mind is lured by your presence
oh i have been seeing the person sent by rama in my dream for a long time this is a pleasant dream to me
even if i can see the heroic rama together with lakshmana in my dream my pain will be gone even the dream is inimical to me i cannot sleep and thus cannot dream
i do not think it is a dream pleasure cannot be experienced by seeing a vanara in a dream i experience pleasure now seeing a monkey in a dream is a bad omen
can this be a delusion of my mind or a mental imbalance resulting in movement of the mind in the body is it a malady born of my madness or is it a mirage
no this cannot be insanity nor even delusion but i recognise this vanara well
considering the strength and weakness of demons in that manner sita thought that hanuman was none other than the king of demons who can asume any form at will
having entertained such thoughts sita the lady with a fairwaist daughter of janaka did not respond to the vanara
hanuman son of the windgod understood what was going on in sitas mind and spoke pleasing words that brought joy in her
rama is glorious as the sun brings delight to the whole world like the moon is the king of kings like vaisravana and renowned like visnu endowed with valour
he is truthful in speech like brihaspati prosperous like kubera sweettongued handsome graceful like kamadeva
he shows anger to one who deserves it he is the foremost charioteer of the world and he is a great self under the shadow of whose shoulders the whole world takes refuge
you will see the consequences of the action of ravana who abducted you deceitfully in the form of deer when rama was away from the hermitage
heroic rama will soon release many scorching fiery arrows in anger and kill ravana i seek your permission as an envoy of rama filled with grief by your separation he has made inquiries about your welfare
the brilliant longarmed lakshmana delight of sumitra enquires about your welfare and offers salutations to you
o goddess like lady ramas friend sugriva king of vanara chieftans inquires about your wellbeing
o vaidehi rama lakshmana and sugriva always remember you luckily you are alive even though you are under the clutches of shedemons
very soon you will see mighty rama lakshmana and sugriva of unlimited prowess surrounded by crores of vanaras
i am sugrivas minister known as hanuman a vanara who entered the city of lanka after leaping over the great ocean
setting my foot with my valour on the head of the cruelminded ravana using my valour i came here to see you
o goddesslike lady i am not a deceitful person as you suppose me to be shake off your suspicion as i speak to you and trust me     thus ends the thirtyfourth sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
on hearing about rama from the bull among vanaras thus spoke vaidehi politely in a sweet voice
where did you come in contact with rama how did you assess lakshmana how did an alliance of vanaras and humans take place
o vanara tell me all about the identification marks of rama and lakshmana again so that grief does not enter my mind
what does rama look like and laksmana how are his thighs arms tell me
questioned thus by vaidehi hanuman son of the windgod started describing ramas physique as it is
o vaidehi with eyes like lotus petals although you know your husbands and lakshmanas form and distinguishing marks it is my good fortune that you asked me to describe them
o largeeyed lady i will describe those distinguishing marks of rama and lakshmana listen
o daughter of janaka rama with eyes like lotus petals is a person born with a delightful form richly endowed with indescribable charm and politeness
he vies with the sun in effulgence with earth in forbearance with brihaspati in intelligence and in fame with indra
rama is a protector of the entire world of living beings not to speak of his own people he is a protector of his own race he guards righteousness he is a scorcher of enemies

his invincible brother saumitri born of a different mother is a replica of rama in affection charm and virtues
while earnestly searching for you all over the earth both tigers among men came in contact with us
while both of them were wandering searching for you all over the earth they saw sugriva the lord of animals who had been thrown out of kingship by his elder brother and was living on the mountain rshyamuka frightened of him
sugriva king of vanaras who is committed to defend truth has been deposed from the kingdom by his elder brother we keep attending on him
both the princes clad in bark robes and armed with powerful bows reached the beautiful location of rshyamukha mountain
on seeing the tigers among men armed with bows sugriva the bull among vanaras jumped from the mountain deluded with fear and reached the peak
thereafter the lord of vanaras staying on the mountain top quickly sent me to meet both of them
i recognised the true status of both the mighty men who were filled with joy placed them on my back and reached the mountaintop
i reported faithfully about both the highsouled men to sugriva as they got to know each other through conversation a fast friendship developed between them
then rama consoled sugriva who was dethroned and abandoned on acount of a woman by his brother vali endowed with great prowess
then lakshmana spoke to the lord of vanaras sugriva about your loss and the grief caused to rama who is adept in accomplishing difficult deeds with ease
having heard the words of lakshmana the king of vanaras became extremely lustreless like the sun overshadowed by the planet rahu
i collected the ornaments and gave them to rama he lost his senses on seeing the jingling ornaments scattered
the divine self who is effulgent like god wailed in many ways placing the beautiful ornaments on his lap
rama looked at them and wept clasping them again and again in grief which inflamed like fire
rama the great self immersed in sorrow lay down on the ground i also consoled him with great difficulty and helped him to get up
longarmed rama along with lakshmana looked at them again and again and gave them to the care of sugriva
o divine lady on account of your separation he is ever blazing like a mountain of fire samvartaka
rama is burning like a furnace by three fires sleeplessness grief and intense anxiety just as the three sacred fires keep a firesanctuary intensely heated
on account of sorrow caused by not being able to see you rama of raghu dynasty is shaken up like a lofty mountain is shaken by earthquake
oh princess unable to see you rama has found no joy in roaming delightful forests rivers and streams
oh daughter of janaka after killing ravana along with his friends and relatives rama the tiger among men will meet you
having become friends rama and sugriva together reached an agreement to kill vali and search for you
thereafter both the princes together arrived at kishkinda and killed vali king of vanaras in a combat
then rama quickly killed vali in a combat and made sugriva the lord of all troops of vanaras and bears
oh illustrious lady in that manner alliance was established between rama and sugriva know me to be hanuman arrived here as their messenger
having obtained his kingdom sugriva despatched the vanara leaders to all ten directions to search for you
following sugrivas orders the powerful monkey leaders huge as the himalayas king of mountains went all over the earth searching
following sugrivas orders we the monkeys since then are moving about searching the entire earth eager to find you or to carry out sugrivas orders
we wasted many nights and days immersed in disappointment for not being able to find you and we missed our path in the great vindhya mountain
we decided to give up our lives due to disappointment transgression of the time limit fixed for us and fear of the monkey lord fear of facing the king without finding you
we decided to give up our lives since we were unable to see the feet of the queen sita even after searching the forest fortresses and the banks of mountain streams
when we were disappointed in tracing you and were at the point of death having been commanded by the king that whosoever overstays would be killed a gigantic powerful bird appeared to fulfil our task
that king of vultures sampati was the brother of king of birds jatayu hearing about the death of his younger brother sampati felt distresed and spoke in anger
o best of vanaras by whom was my younger brother killed where was he dropped down i wish you to tell me all about that
having heard about the death of jatayu o charming lady that sampati arunas son felt sad and told us that you are at ravanas palace
having heard sampatis encouraging words all of us led by angada departed immediately
the happy monkeys were satisfied enthusiastic about seeing you they rose from the vindhya mountain and reached the limit of the sea shore in the north
when the vanara army was feeling despondent at the sight of the ocean i leaped across the sea a hundred yojanas pushing aside all my fear
i entered at night the city of lanka teeming with demons and saw ravana and saw you immersed in sorrow
o sinless lady i have given you a faithful account i am a messenger of dasarathas son and you may speak now o divine lady
o divine lady know that i have come here for your cause carrying out the mission of rama i am sugrivaa minister and son of the windgod
your lord rama of kakutstha race supreme among wielders of weapons is doing well so is venerable lakshmana endowed with auspicious signs engaged in serving him
o queen seeking the welfare of your valiant husband i came here at the behest of sugriva all alone
i can assume any form at my will i searched for you without any help moving in the southern direction and reached this place
fortunately for me i can finally dispel the fear of the vanara chiefs who are regretting your loss by letting them know that you have been found
oh queen luckily for me crossing the ocean has not gone in vain i am fortunate because i will attain fame of finding you
mighty raghava will take you after killing ravana the king of demons along with his kith and kin
oh vaidehi there is a famous mountain called malyavan from there a monkey called kesari went to mount gokarna
he kesari is said to be my father by the divine sages he retrieved a piece of land in a holy spot of that sea shore and killed sambasadana a demon who was oppressing righteous people
o mythili i was born in that land retrieved by the windgod i am known as hanuman by virtue of my own action
in order to inspire confidence in you about me i have narrated the virtues of your husband o sinless queen rama will take you from here very soon
the griefstricken sita trusted him by his logical presentation of reasons as well as identifications she believed that he was a messenger of rama
janaki experienced immeasurable happiness and shed tears of joy through her curved eyes
her face with large eyes with a tinge of red corners shone like the moon released from rahu
she realised that the monkey was none other than hanuman then he looked at her who was pleasing to see and spoke again
mythili everything i intended to say has been narrated to you calm yourself down what shall i do or else tell me what pleases you i shall go back
my father a mighty monkey killed sambasadana in a battle on the command of a great seer i am a vanara born to a monkey by the impact of the windgod i am equal to the windgod in power     thus ends the thirtyfifth sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
mighty hanuman the son of the windgod again spoke to sita humbly to inspire confidence in her
o noble lady i am a vanara an envoy of learned rama you see this ring with ramas name inscribed on it o godlike lady
be calm be blessed your sorrows have come to an end this the ring is given by the great self rama to make you trust me
she received the ornament that adorned her husbands hand and gazed at it and felt delighted as though her husband had arrived
her beautiful countenance with large white eyes with a reddish tinge in the corners shone like the moon released from rahu
young sita felt delighted about her husbands news and blushed by praising him for his action she pleased the great monkey
o foremost among the vanaras you have trespassed the abodes of demons all alone you are mighty and capable and wise
you with your admirable prowess have reduced this ocean which is an abode of crocodiles stretching over a hundred yojanas to a cows hoof mark
i do not think you are an ordinary monkey you have no fear or excitement about ravana you are a bull among vanaras
o best of monkeys as you have been sent by rama the knower of the self it is proper for me to converse with you
the formidable rama will not send any one specially to me without testing him or knowing his valour
to my luck righteous rama who abides in truth and glorious lakshmana who enhances the joy of sumitra are keepng well
indeed if kakutstha is well wherefore does he not burn the oceangirdled earth in his rage as the earth is burnt at the time of dissolution of the era
both of them are capable of subduing even the gods i think the reversal of my fate is reason for their inaction
is rama the greatest among men not depressed does he not feel helpless he is perhaps taking necessary steps for my recovery
i suppose prince rama is not too depressed or perplexed to attend to his work he will perhaps be doing the duties expected of a manly person
tell me if rama scorcher of enemies desirous of victory is following a twofold policy confrontation and conciliation a tough enemy cannot be defeated by following this method a threefold strategy has to be adopted in this case confrontation conciliation and creation of dissension among his foes to be victorious i hope he is welldisposed to his friends and has a good team
i hope he is making new friends who desire his friendship hopefully rama is well honoured by his allies
does the prince ever seek the blessings of gods or fall back upon personal effort as well as providence
i hope rama is not devoid of love towards me by my separation o vanara hope he will liberate me from this misery
i hope rama who deserves happiness and not suffering has not become depressed now having experienced a spate of sorrows
i hope he regularly receives news about the welfare of kausalya sumitra and bharata
i hope respectable rama is not too absentminded for being immersed in sorrow on my account hope he will save me
will bharata the devoted brother send his formidable army of one akshavhini protected by ministers for my cause i trust he will akshauhini foot soldiers horse soldiers elephants soldiers on chariot
i trust that the illustrious sugriva surrounded by valiant vanaras who use their teeth and nails as weapons will reach this place
hope heroic lakshmana enhancer of the joy of sumitra who has mastered the use of weapons will blow away the demons through a network of arrows
can i hope to see ravana and his relatives slain in the battle by fiery weapons in a short time
hope ramas moonlike face without me with its golden complexion and lotus fragrance must not have been pale and withered with tears like the lotus in a pond scorched by the heat
rama has given up sovereignty for the sake of establishing righteousness and led me into the forest on foothe had not then felt any fear anxiety or grief at heartrama showed patience instead hope he retains them
his love for me is superior to his love for his father mother or any one else o messenger i wish to survive till i hear any news from my dear lord
the godlike lady having spoken to the vanara leader in a very meaningful and sweet manner about her beloved rama she remained silent waiting to hear hanumans attractive words of description of rama once again
having heard sita hanuman endowed with fearsome power placed his folded hands on his head and said this
o lotuseyed one rama knows not that you are here therefore he has not taken you away immediately as did indra to rescue his wife sachi
kakutstha rama will still the imperturbable abode of varuna ocean by the torrent of his arrows and rid the city of lanka of all the demons
thereafter whoever comes ramas way be it gods or demons or even death or any one else he will destroy them
o noble lady not being able to see you rama is immersed in an ocean of sorrow he has no solace like an elephant tormented by a lion
o sita i swear in the name of mountains like malaya vindhya meru and dardura the abodes of monkeys and bears and by the roots and fruits as well which are the food of vanaras you will soon behold rama with beautiful eyes red lips like bimba fruit lovely earrings and a countenance resembling the full moon
o vaidehi you will soon see rama seated on the prasravana mountain just as indra who performed a hundred sacrifices seated on the back of the king of elephants
rama is not eating meat nor drinking wine he takes only the one fifth of a meal sanctioned for an ascetic available in the forest
since you left rama has been always thinking sincerely of you no longer drives away flies or mosquitoes nor insects or serpents from his body his mind entirely fixed on you
rama is always lost in thought he is totally given to grief absorbed in love for you he thinks of none else
rama the best of men never goes to sleep and even if he drops off to sleep he mutters sita sita in a sweet voice in his sleep
sighing deeply whenever rama sees a fruit or a flower or any such delightful thing he remembers you and calls you out again and again saying alas my darling
o divine lady prince rama is ceaselessly suffering he keeps talking to you in air the determined rama is only thinking of your recovery
her sorrow was mitigated by references made by hanuman about ramashe felt equally sad when she heard about ramas agony the princess from videha appeared like a night at the advent of autumn with the moon looking partly muffled by clouds and partly bright     thus ends the thirtysixth sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
to the righteous words about ramas grief of hanuman sita with a face like the full moon replied
o vanara you have told me that rama has his mind always fixed on me not on others and you have also said that he is sad it is like offering me poison mixed with nectar
death snatches a man tied with a cord whether he is rolling in luxury or sinking in adversity
o best of vanaras surely it is not possible for living beings to overcome destiny you see how sri rama saumitri and my own self are all afflicted with grief
when will raghava reach the shore of this ocean of grief he is like a man who has suffered a ship wreck trying to swim
when will my husband see me after killing the demons including ravana and uprooting lanka
one years time has been given by ravana to me rama should be informed to be quick in reaching before the completion of the time limit and that i will survive till then only
o vanara this is the end of the tenth month only two more months are left this is the condition laid by the wicked ravana in my case
vibhisana made efforts to advise ravana for my restoration but ravana has not agreed to that
ravana did not like to return me having fallen into the death trap death lies in wait for him in battle
o vanara nala the eldest daughter of vibhisana sent by her mother came here personally and reported this to me
o eminent vanara no doubt my lord will soon reach this place my pure conscience tells me that rama has many virtues
o vanara rama is endowed with perseverance manliness prowess kindness gratitude competence and power
o bull among men he will not be shaken by calamities just as sachi the daughter of puloma knows indras might i know ramas
o monkey the valiant rama is like the sungod shoofing a dazzling volley of arrows which will dry up the sea of enemy forces
while sita tormented with grief on account of rama was thus speaking her eyes filled with tears the monkey said
on hearing me rama will reach soon with a huge army of vanaras and bears
o beautiful lady if you please i shall redeem you today itself from grief you may ride on my back o blameless lady
placing you on my back i shall cross the ocean indeed i have the capacity to carry the entire city of lanka along with ravana
o mythili just as oblations offered to the sacred fire goes to indra i shall offer you today to rama waiting on the prasravana mountain
mighty rama staying in asram ill be enthused to see you seated on my back like lord purandara indra seated on the back of the lord of elephants airavata
o god like lady climb up my back do not be reluctant join rama just as rohini unites with the moon o beautiful one
climb on my back and cross the ocean through space in the flaming light conversing with moon and sun
o beautiful lady it is not possible for all the inhabitants of lanka together to follow me while i carry you from this place
o vaidehi just as i reached here i shall beyond doubt take you on my back in the same way across the sky without any difficulty see
when mythili heard the wonderful proposal from hanuman the best of vanaras she experienced immense joy in every limb of her body and said
hanuman how do you intend to carry me to such a distant place indeed it is your monkey nature i suppose
o bull among monkeys you have such a small body how can you intend to carry me from here to my husband the lord of men
on hearing sitas new belittling statement about him hanuman the illustrious son of the windgod reflected
blackeyed sita is not aware of my strength or my power therefore let her see the real huge form that i can assume at my free will
thinking thus hanuman the noble monkey crusher of enemies started revealing his real form to vaidehi
the wise bull among monkeys jumped down from the tree and started growing in size in order to instil confidence in sita
hanuman the foremost of the vanaras resembling mount meru or mandara stood there glowing like blazing fire in front of sita
resembling a mountain in size with a red face with teeth and nails strong like diamond the vanara in dreadful form said to vaidehi
i have the capacity to carry away this entire lanka uprooted with its mountains gardens forts ramparts and gateways along with the king
o queen it is enough give up this unworthy attitude be stable o vaidehi rid lakshmana and rama of grief
seeing the son of maruta in dreadful form the broad lotus petaleyed daughter of janaka with eyes as large as lotus petals replied
o great monkey i have understood your strength and power your speed is like the windgods and your power is astonishing and splendid
o chief of vanaras how could an ordinary person be capable of reaching this land on far off shore of the immeasurable ocean
i know you are capable of carrying me on your journey i am sure about the quick success of your mission which has been carried out after careful planning
o sinless and foremost monkey going with you is not proper for me your windlike speed will render me unconscious
when you fly over the ocean in the sky speedily i may tumble down from your back by your speed out of fear
o destroyer of foes it is not possible for me to go with you further when you are burdened with a woman you will also fall into danger because of me no doubt
when i am seen while being carried away by the demons of fearsome valour they will pursue you ordered by the wicked ravana
o heroic monkey as the warriors armed with spears and maces surround you and attack your life will be in danger because of me
the demons are in large number and they will be armed with weapons you are unarmed how can you fight and protect me
o noble monkey while you are engaged in fighting with those demons of wicked deeds i may drop down out of fear
o noble monkey the massive fearsome and powerful demons may defeat you in the fight in any way
or else while you are engaged in fighting and turn your attention the other way i might fall down and the sinful ogres may bear me away
they may snatch me away from your hands or cut me to pieces success or defeat is uncertain in a war
in such a case caught and intimidated by the demons i may die then your efforts will be wasted
it may be that you can kill all the demons but by such an act the fame of rama will be diminished he cannot give his strength a trial
or else the ogres will carry me and conceal me in a secret place which the vanaras or rama and lakshmana may not know
o strongarmed hanuman your life and the life of the great self rama of his brother and relatives of your king is dependent upon my survival
both rama and lakshmana who are emaciated with sorrow and suffering on account of me will give up their lives along with vanaras and bears
o chief of vanaras i cherish my devotion towards rama alone and not touch the body of any other man
i had no control over myself i was helpless and my husband was not present when i had to bear the touch of ravanas limbs what can i do
it will be proper if rama comes here kills ravana along with all his relations and takes me away
i have seen and heard about ramas conquest of enemies and his valiant deeds in war indeed gods gandharvas nagas or even demons cannot match him in war
o chief of vanaras who can withstand rama accompanied by lakshmana the conqueror of enemies his arrows resemble the rays of the sun at the time of the deluge steady like the elephants who support the quarters of the earth
satisfied with the words of sita the tiger among monkeys who was eloquent in speech said
o queen o lady of auspicious appearance your words are most appropriate to and characteristic of a modest virtuous woman
it may not be possible for a woman to cross on my back the vast ocean stretching over a hundred yojanas it is not possible for a woman
o humble lady the second reason given by you i ought not to touch a person other than rama is well said and worthy of you being the wife of the great soul who else can speak such words
o queen kakutstha rama will hear from me fully all that has been said and done by you in my presence without any omission
o queen my heart is drenched with love for rama and desires to please him for many reasons therefore these words have been spoken by me
crossing the ocean and entering lanka are difficult but i accomplished it hence my proposal
i offered to take you today itself out of my love and devotion to rama with a desire to unite you with him and not with any other intention
o blameless lady if you wish not to accompany me you may give me a token of identification to let rama know about my coming here and seeing you
having heard hanuman sita a child of god said these words in a low tone choked with tears carry this token of identity to my dear husband
long ago we were staying at siddhasrama this hermitage was situated to the northeast at the foot of chitrakuta mountain which was not far from the river mandakini it had abundant roots fruits and water you sported with me in the gardens which were fragrant with many types of flowers and ponds you sat down on my lap with wet clothes in the hermitage
then a crow greedy of flesh began to peck my bossom with its beak i took a clod of earth and warded him off
the crow was an eater of offerings hungry for food began to peck me again and again for fleshhe did not stop
my upper cloth was slipping i was trying to pull up my waist string angrily when you saw me
then you made fun of me and i became angry i was abashed torn by the voracious bird i sought your shelter
exhausted i sat on your lap again seeing my angry face you pacified me you were happy to see me draw close
o lord when i was angered by the crow and my face was filled with tears you marked me wiping my eyes
totally exhausted i slept on your lap for a long time and in turn you slept on my lap later
the crow came back again and clawed me in the space between my breasts even after i woke up after slumber from ramas lap flying it tore my bosom again and again
o strongarmed rama seeing my torn breasts you became angry like a hissing serpent and hissing said
o sita with a beautiful lap like an elephant trunk by whom is your bosom wounded who is sporting with an angry fivehooded snake
then looking around you saw the crow facing me with sharp bloodstained claws
this crow was the best of birds he was surely indras son who had covered a long distance with great speed and his speed was like the windgods
then you the strongarmed and best among the wise your eyeballs rolling in fury made up your mind about the cruel crow
taking out a blade of darbha grass from your mat you invoked the weapon of brahma by reciting the mantra then you discharged it which blazed like the fire of death and went spearheading towards the crow
then you threw the burning darbha grass at the crow and it chased him in the sky
then that crow flew to many places seeking asylum all over the universe chased by the blade of grass
then the crow went round all the three worlds having been rejected by his father indra including all the sages and gods refused by all he came back to rama seeking shelter
seeing the crow fallen on the ground o kakutstha you who are a saviour of those who seek refuge saved him out of compassion even though he deserved to be killed
rama you saw the crow in pain and despondency who returned to you and said that it is not possible to make brahmas weapon ineffectualyou may tell now what should be done
then that crow said let my right eye be blinded you then hit the right eye of the crow thus the crow offered his right eye and saved himself
that crow offered salutations to you rama and king dasaratha thereafter took permission and went to his own dwelling
addressing rama as though he was present before her sita said o lord of the earth for my sake you released the weapon of brahma on a crow what makes you excuse him who has abducted me
o bull among men you are so loving to me i am like an orphan be kind to me she who has found her lord in you stays without a protector
o my supreme lord i know you are kind righteous valiant vigroous mighty you are boundless calm and deep like the ocean you are lord of earth and the seas and compeer of vasava i have heard from you that motiveless compassion is the best way to make one righteous
even though you are an expert in the use of weapons truthful and strong yet why are you not using weapons aganst the demons
now sita turns to hanuman and says in war serpents gandharvas demons or marutas cannot withstand the speed of ramas arrows and hit back
does rama have a little anxiety about me if he has why does he a disciplined hero not put an end to the demons with his sharp arrows
or why does the mighty hero lakshmana who is a scorcher of enemies not come to my rescue taking the orders from his brother
both rama and lakshmana are tigers among men who resemble wind and fire in power and have the unassailability of the gods wherefore are they disregarding me
perhaps i must have committed an atrocious sin there is no doubt for although both of them are scorchers of enemies they deliver me not
hearing the piteous words of vaidehi and beholding her eyes filled with tears the windgods son lustrous hanuman replied thus
o godlike lady rama is not averse to your misery on my word this is true rama is immersed in sorrow even lakshmana wails
i could find you with difficulty this is not the time to wail o blameless lady take it your sorrow has come to an end at this moment
both the mighty brothers tigers among men are eager to see you both the princes will reduce this lanka into ashes
o largeeyed lady cruel ravana along with his relatives will be killed by rama in war and rama will return to his city with you
communicate your message to mighty rama and lakshamana to brilliant sugriva and even the vanaras who gather there
hanuman having spoken this way sita resembling a gods daughter grieving thus addressed hanuman
bow to rama and offer salutations on my behalf inquiries concerning his welfare should be addressed to rama whom virtuous kausalya bore as a son
great righteous lakshmana had given up his pleasures and followed his brother rama in his favour into the forest to be able to serve him
lakshmana who has lionshoulders and strong arms who is handsome who takes rama as his father and treats me as his own mother
heroic lakshmana did not know while i was borne away he is prosperous foremost in serving elders he is energetic and reserved in his speech like my fatherinlaw he is a prince dear to his brother
ramas brother lakshmana is always dear to me heroic lakshmana will discharge whichever responsibility is entrusted to him
he is lakshmana for whose care and support rama did not miss the noble king dasaratha during exile convey him my words of enquiry about his wellbeing
lakshmana is soft pure competent and dear to rama o great vanara act in such a manner that lakshmana can mitigate my suffering o great monkey the best of vanaras you are competent in accomplishing this task
by your efforts alone my husband will try for my release you may tell these words to my heroic husband rama again and again
i will hold on to life only for a month beyond i will not survive i swear by truth you may tell this to rama
o heroic rama just as kausik was rescued from the underworld it behoves you to deliver me from imprisonment of wicked ravana
then sita took out the exquisite and auspicious chudamani worn on the head untied from her clothes and gave it to hanuman to be presented to rama
then hanuman taking the extraordinary jewel and placed it on his finger as it was not fitting to his arm
having recieved the jewel from sita and circumambulated her hanuman offered salutations to her and stood by her
hanuman stood there physically with great joy gazing at sita but mentally he was with rama
having received the most precious jewel from the daughter of janaka hanuman prepared to return like a mountain released from the impact of the wind     thus ends the thirtyeighth sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
sita gave the jewel to hanuman and said this signet ornament is known to rama very well
seeing this jewelrama will recall three of us my mother myself and the king dasaratha as this was given by her mother at her marriage
great hanuman you are enthused now you may think over the future course of action
o best of monkeys it is your responsibility to carry out this task o hanuman think carefully of that take the initiative to reduce my suffering i am confident that you can do it
hanuman possessed with fierce valour said to vaidehi so be it and bowed his head and offered salutations before he departed
the noble lady sita having been fully convinced about hanuman and realising that he is about to start her voice was choked with tears she said these words
o hanuman the great communicate my welfare to both rama and lakshmana to sugriva his ministers elderly vanaras in righteous order
you must pacify the strongarmed rama in a manner by which he will help me to cross the ocean of grief and rlieve me
let the illustrious rama take me alive help me with your persuasive words and you will acquire merit
on hearing your ever spirited words his manliness to get me back will be charged
having heard sitas words hanuman son of maruta placed his folded palms over his head in reverence and replied
kakutstha rama accompanied by vanaras and bears will reach here soon and conquer the enemies in war and relieve your grief
i do not see any one among humans or demons or even among gods who can face his arrows when released
indeed rama is capable of conquering even the sungod or the raingod or yama the son of the sun specially for your sake
rama is fit to rule the entire earth surrounded by the ocean o delight of janaka he will succeed in serving your cause
on hearing the truthful proper pleasing words by hanuman whom she held in great esteem sita said this
sita again and again looked at hanuman who was about to start she made him understand her words conveying her love for rama
o destroyer of enemies if you think of halting for a day you may do so in a solitary location and leave tomorrow
your presence will relieve me of my suffering if you stay here for a while
o tiger among vanaras if you leave this place to come again my life will be uncertain if your coming is uncertain there is no doubt about it
my agony would be increased further by not seeing you it would be inflamming my agony and i would be even more pained
o heroic chief of vanaras i am doubtful as to whether vanaras and bears can extend help
how can the army of vanaras and bears for that matter princes rama and lakshmana negotiate the ocean which is difficult to cross
it is only three beings who have the capacity to leap over this ocean garuda or you or the windgod
what means do you being the foremost hero among the three who are capable performing this difficult task foresee
o slayer of enemy heroes if you alone can accomplish this task the fame of doing this will be yours
it would be worthy of rama if he with his entire army emerges victorious over ravana in a battle and takes me to his city
if kakutstha rama slayer of the enemy army fills the entire lanka with his arrows and takes me then his action will be worthy of him
you may make arrangement in such a manner that that great self the hero in war makes his victorious march which is worthy of him
having heard the meaningful courteous and logical words of sita hanuman replied
o devi the lord of monkeys sugriva heads the army of vanaras and bears he is richly endowed with satvaguna and is determined to accomplish your cause and free you from sorrow
o vaidehi sugriva will reach this place with thousands of crores of vanaras very soon and would kill all the ogres
valiant virtuous and powerful vanaras who can leap with the speed of mind are awaiting orders of sugriva
their course cannot be impeded either upward or downward or right or left they are indeed very brilliant and would never fail in any task
they have often circumambulated the earth including its oceans and mountains through the aerial path with great enthusiasm
the vanaras under sugriva who move in the forest are more powerful than me or equal to me none is inferior to me
if i have managed to come here why not the other powerful ones the superior leaders are not sent as messengers only ordinary ones like me are
o noble lady therefore give up your agony enough of your lamentation the monkey troops will reach this place in one stride
both the valiant rama and lakshmana lions among men looking brilliant like sun and moon will come to you riding on my back
both the heroes rama and lakshmana will come and blow up the city of lanka with their unfailing arrows
o beautiful lady raghava the delight of the raghu race would kill ravana and his kins and return with you to his city
therefore count the days and rest assured let it be auspicious to you you will shortly see rama burning like fire
when ravana is slain with his sons ministers and kith and kin you will reunite with rama as rohini unites with the moon
o queen mythili you come to the end of your sorrow and will soon see ravana killed by rama
having thus consoled vaidehi hanuman son of the windgod resolved to depart once again he spoke to vadehi
very soon you would see the slayer of foes who is an accomplished wielder of the bow rama along with lakshmana at the entrance of lanka
you will soon see heroic vanaras whose weapons are their teeth who are like lion and tiger in their valour they are mighty like wellbred elephants
o respectable lady you would see many troops of vanara chiefs who resemble clouds hovering on the mountain peaks of lankaroaring
rama is tormented by the dreadful arrows of the god of love pierced into vitals like an elephant hit by a lion he has no happiness in life
o devi weep no moreentertain no unpleasant thoughtsyou have a great husband just as sachi has her lord indra
who is superior to rama who is equal to lakshmana both the brothers are like fire and wind they are your refuge
o noble lady you will not stay longer in this country which is a strong hold of hosts of demons and a dreadful place it will not be very long before you unite with your beloved pray have patience till then     thus ends the thirtyninth sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
sita who was like the daughter of the gods heard the son of the windgod for her benefit and replied
o vanara just as the earth feels happy when the half grown crops receive rain i feel happy after seeing you you have been speaking pleasing words
be kind to me and act in such a manner that i may embrace my lord passionately with my body emaciated with grief
o best leader of vanaras remind rama about the incident of the release of a blade of grass in anger blinding one of the eyes of the crow narrated to you
further remind him when my tilaka mark was erased you painted tilaka with a stone manassita pigment nearby o rama you should remember that incident
rama you are like indra and varuna in valiance how are you tolerating sita seized dwelling among the demons
o sinless rama this wonderful chudamani of mine has been carefully safeguarded seeing this is like seeing you when i am in distress
i am sending you this chudamani born of the sea o glorious rama and now engrossed in grief it is not possible for me to live
i am tolerating this unbearable grief and the words of the dreadful ogresses piercing my heart only for you
o subduer of enemies o prince i will hold on to life only for a month i will not survive beyond a month in your absence
the demon king is frightful he looks at me with immoral lusty eyes i do not wish to live even for a moment after hearing about the adversities you have faced
hearing the words of sita who was weeping piteously brilliant hanuman said this
o irreproachable lady i swear by you that rama has grown averse to everything out of grief of separation from you when rama is in grief even lakshmana gets immersed in sorrow
o beautiful lady somehow i could meet you this is not the time to worry about you will see the end of suffering at this very moment
both the princes are tigers among men and crushers of enemies they are determined to see you and will reduce lanka to ashes
o largeeyed lady killing in war the vile ravana the demon king and all his relatives rama would take you back to his own city
o unimpeachable lady give one more identification which would make him more happy
i have already given the best identification when you hand this jewel used on my hair to him he will believe what you tell him
the illustrious vanara held the ornament prostrated to sita and prepared to depart
seeing hanuman eager to leap enlarging his body quickly she appeared pitiable with her face filled with tears and throat choked
o hanuman to the lionlike brothers rama and lakshmana to sugriva including his ministers and to every one convey my good wishes
you should make efforts in such a manner that the mightyarmed rama will help me in crossing the cean of sorrow
foremost vanara tell rama about my intense grief as well as the threats of the demons may your journey be happy
hanuman understood the message of princess sita and felt delighted at heart at his accomplishment considering the small task yet to be accomplished he reached the northern shore mentally he thought of rama who waited in kishkinda which is in the northern direction     thus ends the fortieth sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
having been honoured and praised by sitas words hanuman prepared to depart from sitas presence
with demons negotiation is of no use they are wealthy they need no gifts proud of their stregth the demons will not yield to dissension i think only by using power it can be done
other than power there is no way to accomplish the task of ascertaining their strength if i slay a few strong ogres somehow they may soften a little and yield
he who can perform tasks in addition to the objective accomplished without affecting it is really worthy
there are ways more than one even to perform a small work and the capable know it
if i ascertain the difference in the strength of enemies and vanaras in war here itself and return to kishkinda the abode of vanaras then i would have executed the orders of my lord properly
how can i have enduring war with the ogres today how will my visit to this place end in happy return only in a combat this tenheaded ravana will guage his strength and mine
i can return happily only after i gauge the tenheaded ravanas army in war his strength his companions including the ministers and his mind
this ashoka garden of ravana filled with different kinds of trees and creepers is a feast to the eyes and mind it is an excellent garden like the nandana garden of indra
i will devastate this garden just as fire destroys a dried up forest this will enrage ravana
then the demon king will order the horses chariots and elephants and army equipped with tridents and spears to march against me a great war will take place
i will fight with the ogres sent by ravana endowed with fierce strength and irresistible valour after destroying their army i will go to the abode of vanaras happily
furious maruti endowed with fierce valour started uprooting the trees with the speed sprung from his thighs like the windgod
then hanuman felled a variety of trees and vines inhabited by intoxicated birds in the beautiful garden meant for womenfolk
that garden looked ugly with uprooted trees breached ponds and powdered mountain peaks
vines and trees wilted birds shrieking the embankments of ponds destroyed its tender coppery red shoots withered the garden looked as though it is burnt by forest fire and the climbers looked like women shivering in fear with their robes disarrayed
the great garden lay disfigured with the arbours and the picture galleries ruined huge serpents and wild animals scattered with stone houses and sheds destroyed
the pleasuregarden of ravana appeared as though it was spreading the creepers of sorrow since it was totally destroyed by the monkey who had set out to protect a woman  of the pleasure garden  of the hero who came to protect a lady
the great vanara having perpetrated mischief rousing anger in the mind of the great lord of wealth stood at the exit doorway ready to combat singlehanded with many warriors in that mighty army blazing in glory     thus ends the fortyfirst sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
the residents of lanka panicked at the shrieking sounds of birds and cracking sounds of trees
the frightened beasts and birds ran and flew screeching in all directions fierce portents appeared to the demons
hideouslooking ogresses awakened from sleep saw the garden devastated by the heroic vanara
when the powerful mighty and strongarmed hanuman saw the ogresses he assumed a very huge form in order to strike terror in them
then seeing the huge body of the mighty vanara resembling a mountain the ogresses questioned janaki about him
who is he by whom has he been sent from where and why did he come here what dialogue did you have with him
o lovely largeeyed lady o auspicious one have no fear what conversation did he have with you tell us
chaste and beautiful sita said how do i know about the ogresses who assume many fierce forms
you alone can know about who he is and what he is about a serpent alone knows the movement footprints of another serpent there is no doubt about it
i am also scared of him i do not know who he is i think he is a demon who came here assuming a form of his choice
listening to vaidehis words the ogresses divided themselves and fled in all directions while some stood there others went to report to ravana
the uglyfaced ogresses went to the presence of ravana and reported about the frightening form of the vanara
your majesty an extremely powerful and frightening vanara had a dialogue with sita he is stationed in the midst of ashoka garden
the deereyed sita is not willing to disclose to us his identity even when we questioned her
he may be an envoy of indra or kubera or of rama sent with an intent to trace sita
your beautiful pleasure garden filled with a variety of beasts has been ruined by this wonderful figure
there is not a single place that has not been ruined by him there only the place where janakas daughter sita is resting has not been touched
it is not clear whether he spared that place for protecting janakai or he stopped due to exhaustion what is fatigue for him it must be to save her that she is spared by him
he has spared the simsupa tree with lovely tender leaves and flowers which is a chosen resort by sita
your highness should take severe action on that person of fierce appearance with whom sita dared to speak and by whom the garden is ruined
o lord of the demon clan who dares to talk to sita if he has not given up all hope of life since she is desired by you
on listening to the report of the ogresses ravana the lord of demons flared up like blazing flame of a sacrificial fire his eyeballs rolling in rage
from his angry eyes fell down drops of tears just as burning drops of oil drip from two burning lamps
then powerful ravana commanded heroic demons called kinkaras who vied in strength to catch hanuman
eighty thousand powerful kinkaras a clan of demons largebellied with large teeth and of dreadful appearance swift in action armed with hammers and clubs marched from there resolved to capture hanuman
the kinkaras rushed towards the leader of vanaras who stood near the archway like the moths rushing towards the flame
they assailed hanuman with iron maces crowbars edged with gold and shining arrows resembling the sun
they quickly surrounded hanuman and stood with hammers sharpedged spears tridents barbed missiles and powerful javelins
gigantic hanuman illustrious and brilliant roared and waved his tail striking it with force on the ground causing loud sound
hanuman son of maruti enlarged his body to a huge size and patted himself wildly making loud noise that echoed the entire lanka
by the highly frightening sound caused by hanuman patting the birds from the sky fell down making a loud noise and hanuman proclaimed in a loud voice as follows
victory to rama the mighty and powerful victory to lakshmana victory to king sugriva who is ruled by rama
i son of the windgod destroyer of hostile armies am a servant of rama the lord of kosala kingdom a man of unwearied action
even a thousand ravanas will not match me in strength when i pound stones and trees in a thousand ways
i shall destroy the city of lanka and pay my respects to mythili right under the nose of all demons i will return with my purpose accomplished
terrified on hearing the roar the kinkaras looked at the towering hanuman who seemed like a cloud in twilight red in colour
obeying their kings commnad putting aside their fear the kinkaras freely attacked the vanara from all directions with dreadful weapons
extremely powerful hanuman surrounded by heroes all over on his part went to the archway and picked up a terrific iron beam
hanuman the mighty hero seized the iron beam and struck the kinkaras just as garuda the son of vinata shoots up a struggling serpent and starts taking strides in the sky with the weapon in his hand like indra with his thunderbolt did with demons
the great windgods son killed the kinkaras and returned to the archway desiring further combat
then a few surviving ogres took to their heels after getting over that shock and reported to ravana of the destruction of the kinkaras in the combat
the mighty demon king having heard about the killing of the formidable army of ogres his eyes rolling in rage commanded the son of prahasta who is difficult to conquer and matchless in war     thus ends the fortysecond sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
having slain the kinkaras hanuman stood and reflected i have ruined the garden and not the palatial buildings that are like temples chaityas then hanuman son of the windgod decided in his mind to show his strength and jumped on to the top of the palatial building that appeared like the peak of mount meru
the powerful vanara leader climbed the tall palatial building which resembled a mountain he looked like another sun just risen
having destroyed the fine palace building the indomitable hanuman was blazing with glory like the mountain pariyatra one of the seven kula mountains viz mahendra malaya sahya shuktiman riksha vindhya and pariyatra
hanuman heaved his body huge with his prowess and patted his arms loudly filling the city of lanka with that terrible sound
by the deafening sound caused by the patting the birds fell down and the guards of the palace lost consciousness
may sri rama unsurpassed in the use of missiles be victorious may his brother mighty lakshmana a matchless warrior be victorious may king sugriva ruled by rama be victorious
i am the son of the windgod destroyer of enemy army i am a servant of rama the king of kosala who can accomplish any task with ease
not even a thousand ravanas can stand my might in combat as i start assailing them with thousands of rocks or even trees
i shall return only after accomplishing the destruction of the city of lanka and offering obeisance to sita while all demons keep looking at me
having made proclamations that way from the top of the vimana palace the monkey leader roared making terrific sound frightening the ogres
hearing the terrific sound a hundred gigantic guards of the palace set forth holding different kinds of weapons like darts swords and axes and hurled at maruti surrounding him
holding astonishing maces decorated with gold iron crowbars and sharp arrows resembling the rays of the sun the ogres hit hanuman the foremost of vanaras
the demons surrounding the great monkey looked like a big whirlpool of the water of the river ganga
thereupon the infuriated son of the windgod assumed a fearsome form uprooted a pillar of the palace decked with gold and holding that hundred edged pillar whirled it round swiftly
thereafter fire was generated through friction and with if the palace blazed hanuman saw the palace burning he killed a hundred demons there as indra killed demons with his thunderbolt the whirling pillar that generated fire apeared like a thunderbolt later he stood in the air and proclaimed this
thousands of huge and mighty monkeys equal to me loyal to king sugriva are coming under the orders and have been recruited from the entire earth they are the best among monkeys
of them some have the strength equal to ten elephants others are ten times stronger and still others have a thousand elephants strength
some have the strength of flood waters some are powerful as wind and yet others have strength beyond measure
sugriva will come here with hundreds of thousands of crores of vanaras who would be fighting with their teeth and nails as weapons
you have established great enmity with the noble lord of ikshvaku dynasty neither this lanka will endure nor you nor even ravana will be traced     thus ends the fortythird sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
commanded by the demon king jambumali the invincible son of prahasta who had large teeth in front big rolling eyes red flower garland red robes and a chaplet with beautiful earrings he went round twanging his producing thunderous sound his arrows were huge shining and beautiful
all directions including the intermediate directions and the sky were filled with that loud sound produced by his twang
seeing him coming in a chariot drawn by donkeys hanuman who was swift to act was glad to have an opportunity to fight and made a loud noise
strongarmed jambumali with his sharp arrows hit great hanuman who stood on top of the exit archway
jambumali released a crescentshaped arrow on the face one earshaped barbed arrow on the head and ten iron arrows into the arms of the lord of monkeys
his red face struck by an arrow appeared like a fullblown lotus in autumn season hit by the rays of the sun
his red face stained with blood was glowing bright like red lotus in the sky sprinkled with drops of red sandal
struck by the shafts of the ogre the great monkey was enraged and happened to see a huge heavy rock lying beside him on the ground
powerful hanuman with all vehemence lifted the rock and hurled it at the giant which he angrily smashed with ten arrows
hanuman a strong powerful and fierce warrior pulled out a sala tree and whirled it seeing that his attempt has failed
gigantic jambumali seeing the mighty hanuman whirling the sala tree fired many arrows at him
he struck the sala tree with four arows the arm of hanuman with five arrows chest with one the hollow of the chest with ten more arrows
hanuman filled with arrows all over his body seized an iron spear which he made use of in the initial battle and impetuously spun it in intense anger
hanuman of immeasurable strength hurled the iron spear after turning it round and round at high speed on the broad chest of jambumali
neither his head could be discerned nor his arms knees nor bow chariot nor donkeys nothing was seen
mighty jambumali killed by that blow dropped down dead at once with his ornaments reduced to powder
ravanas eyes became bloodshot in anger when he heard about the death of jambumali and of the strong army of kinkaras
when the mighty son of prahasta was killed infuriated ravana his eyes red and rolling commanded the highly valiant sons of ministers     thus ends the fortyfourth sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
commanded by ravana the seven sons of minister blazing like fire followed by large army of experts in archery possessing great valour armed with weapons being distinguished wielders of weapons skilled in the use of weapons who were equally capable of conquering each other sallied forth gladly to fight with hanuman they drove chariots yoked with horses which were decked with golden mesh holding totem staffs a figure engraved to identify a hero and flags neighing like clouds the valiant heroes were sporting and making sounds like stormy clouds wielding wonderful bows glittering like molten gold shining like lightning as they marched from the palace they looked like stormy clouds accompanied by lightning
their mothers and relatives and their friends were struck with grief when they learnt about the kinkaras killed
the barnished golden ornaments worn by them were shining as they brushed shoulders with one another eager to fight first to attack hanuman who stood waiting at the main archway
they went roaring with their chariots rattling sending forth torrents of arrows like the stormy clouds thundering
later hanuman covered with showers of arrows scattered all over appeared like the king of mountains shot with showers of rain
then the monkey moving fast in the clear sky rendered the arrows of the giant heroes and speeding chariots futile
sporting in the sky with the giants who held bows in their hands hanuman shone like the powerful windgod sporting in the sky surrrounded by rambling dark clouds
valiant hanuman making terrific sound and frightening the army of ogres marched swiftly
the scorcher of enemies hanuman hit some ogres with his palm some with his feet and some with his fist and pierced some with his nails
the monkey strangled some with his chest and some between his thighs a few fell down dead on the ground hearing his roaring noise
struck by fear on seeing hanuman the seven sons of ministers dropped down dead on the ground and their army fled in all the ten directions
the elephants trumpeted discordantly out of fear the horses fell down on the ground and even the chariots with seats parasols and flag staffs broken were strewn all over the ground
streams of blood flowed and lanka was filled with many kinds of horrifying sounds of cries
having killed the ogres who were old and strong the valiant and mighty hanuman wishing to slay the other ogres advanced towards the archway     thus ends the fortyfifth sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
coming to know that the seven sons of the ministers were slain by the great vanara ravana who had concealed his feelings of agony thought of a good plan
the tenheaded ravana eager to capture hanuman commanded his five army generals called virupaksha yupaksha durdhara praghasa and bhaskarna who were great warriorstatesmen valiant and equal to wind in speed
o army generals march with a large strong army with horses chariots and elephants and punish the vanara
go to that forestdweller and make all efforts to impose on him punishment appropriate to time and place keeping in view the harm he has done
judging again and again from all actions i do not think he is an ordinary monkey he is a being endowed with great strength
to me it appears he is created by indra with his ascetic power for punishing us i have subdued nagas yakshas gandharvas and even gods asuras and ascetics with your help so you should certainly bring him here without doing any harm capture the monkey forcibly do not insult that mighty monkey
earlier i have seen monkeys of immense prowess like vali and sugriva as well as jambavan the bear also i have seen the army general nila dvivida and others they do not have such tremendous splendour or movement valour intellect and strength and energy they did not have such ability to change form at their will
it should be understood that he has taken the form of a monkey you have to put in extraordinary effort to capture him by acting in a suitable manner
even indra suras asuras and humans and the three worlds together are incompetent to stand before you in a battlefield
even then you should safeguard yourself with great effort adopting warstrategies in an intelligent manner to be victorious for success in war is uncertain
taking kings order the strong and swift warriors resplendent as the flame of sacrificial fire sallied forth with their army on chariots on the back of rutting elephants some on swift horses equipped with sharp weapons of many kinds
the heroic giants caught sight of the vanara who was blazing encircled as though he was by the rays of his own glory looking like the rising sun he was endowed with extraordinary agility intelligence and tremendous strength standing waiting at the archway
having observed the tremendous strength intelligence and swiftness in action of hanuman the generals of the army positioned at all directions and assailed him with dreadful weapons
durdhara pierced into the head of hanuman with five sharp arrows and polished steel shafts with yellow tips gold shining like red lotus petals they were like petals of lilies thrown on the head of hanuman causing no pain
with five arrows pierced in the head of the vanara hanuman leaped into the sky with terrible roar which resounded in all the ten directions
then the powerful hero durdhara mounted on his chariot fastened his bowstring and hit hanuman with hundreds of sharp arrows
the great monkey kept away the showering arrows like the wind prevents raincloud from showering rain drops at the end of monsoon
when the son of the windgod was attacked by durdhara he again grew in size
hanuman suddenly leaped far off into the air at high speed and fell on durdharas chariot just like a thunderous lightning falls on a mountain
having lost his chariot the horses yoked to it killed its axle and pole broken to pieces durdhara fell down dead from the chariot
seeing the body of durdhara fallen on the ground enraged virupaksha and yupaksha the unassailable crushers of enemies leaped towards him
as the strongarmed vanara stood stationed in the clear white sky both the generals leaped into the sky and hit him all of a sudden with two iron hammers
powerful hanuman an equal to garuda in valour fell down while resisting the swift generals
then the son of the windgod seized a sala tree uprooted it lifted it and smashed the two giant generals with it
finding all the three generals dead swift praghasa advanced towards the vanara and attacked him valiant bhasakarna also lifted a trident and attacked him both were famous for swift and violent action in war
praghasa fought back the glorious tiger among vanaras with a sharp crowbar on one side and bhaskarana attacked with a spear from the other
attacked by both the generals the fur on the vanaras body was smeared with blood from his wounded limbs shining like the rising sun smeared with blood became furious
hanuman a courageous and mighty elephant among the monkeys uprooted a mountain peak along with its animals serpents and trees and killed both the demon generals
when the five army chiefs were killed hanuman began to destoy the remaining army force
the vanara pitted horses against horses elephants against elephants warriors against warriors and chariots against chariots as indra destroyed demons
there was no path one could not move forward with elephants and horses killed and with broken axles of great chariots and smashed chariots spread all over the way
then the heroic monkey having killed the army generals and their army and destroyed their vehicles in war came back to the archway after reviewing and stood like the timespirit bent upon the destruction of humanity     thus ends the fortysixth sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
hearing the sad news of death of the five army generals including their followers and destruction of their vehicles king ravana gave a suggestive look at prince aksha who was inclined to fight the war
spurred by the mere glance of ravana the glorious aksha with his wonderful bow inlaid with gold sprang up from the royal assembly just as flame rises from firesanctuary when oblations are poured in by reputed brahmins
ascending a glittering chariot inlaid with pure gold aksha the courageous bull among giants looking splendid like the rising sun marched forth towards the great vanara
the chariot was strong as it was gained by his austerities of high order it was overlaid with pure gold armour fixed with flags and staff studded with precious gems yoked to the best of eight horses and endowed with the speed of mind
the chariot was unassailable to suras or asurasit moved without touching the ground it could fly in air and had the splendour of the sun it was equipped readily with quivers eight swords javelins and clubs placed in right order
prince aksha whose courage was equal to that of gods shone like the sun he ascended the splendid chariot decked with golden garlands shining like sun and moon equipped with all weapons bows and shields etc he went out
seated on the chariot he aksha sallied forth along with the army filling the entire earth and mountains with the sounds of horses elephants and rumblings of big chariots and reached the portal where the great vanara stood
the lioneyed aksha saw the vanara who appeared like the cosmic fire at the time of dissolution of the universe the prince was astonished and struck with awe at the majestic form of the vanara and looked at him with great respect
aksha the mighty prince judging the speed and prowess of the monkey with his own in confronting enemies and the strength of the monkey began to swell up in spirit like the glow of the sun at the end of winter
knowing that it is difficult to win hanuman who was steady and of irresistible valour aksha was angry remaining steady with full attention he provoked the vanara to fight and released three sharp arrows
then aksha contempuously looked at hanuman who had conquered his fatigue and was determined to defeat the enemy holding in his hands his bow and arrows proudly he reflected
adorned with armlets studded with golden coins and lovely earrings aksha advanced instantaneously to meet the monkey their matchless combat excuitement and enthusiasm even among gods and demons
witnessing the fight between hanuman and prince aksha even the earth shrieked in agony the sun became dim the wind stopped blowing mountains were shaken the sky thundered and even the ocean was agitated
heroic aksha who was good at targeting correctly with due concentration struck the vanara on his head with three goldenshafted winged arrows with feathers smeared with poison which resembled serpents
with the three arrows shot on his forehead simultaneously his eyes were drenched with flowing blood and with arrows shining like rays he appeared like the rising sun garlanded by glowing rays
hanuman the esteemed minister of the copperyeyed sugriva observed the prince holding manifold splendid weapons he rejoiced grew in size ready to fight making the necessary prepararions taking the required position
huge hanuman endowed with strength and valour looked like the rising sun on the peak of mount mandara he looked at prince aksha and his army as well as his vehicles as though he was burning them with the rays emerging from his fiery eyes
aksha with his wonderful quiver and bow began to rain rapidly a shower of arrows in the battle on the mountainlike monkeylord just as a cloud rains on a mountain
then hanuman saw prince aksha endowed with excessive splendour power and energy advancing in a fierce manner like a cloud in the battle then hanuman happy to see the heroic prince roared like a clap of thunder
young aksha proud of his valour with eyes bloodshot in anger rushed towards the matchless hanuman just as an elephant would approach a huge pitfall covered with grass
struck by the arrows released by prince aksha hanuman roared violently like a thundering cloud and leaped into the sky putting up a fierce appearance stretching his arms and thighs
dodging like the wind between the arrows and also escaping the arrows hanuman who was swift in movement like the mind was seen exhibiting his terrific valour in the battle while he moved in the sky
admiring the young akshas appearance his skill in holding the quiver and spreading the excellent arrows with missiles and facing the war hanuman became thoughtful as to how to kill him
the strongarmed hanuman who was aware of the propriety of actions wounded in his arms by the warrior prince started roaring and thinking about the next strategy in the combat
he aksha is like the radiant rising sun with extraordinary might he is accomplishing great deeds unlike young warriors of his age and is exhibiting a magnificent feat he knows all means of fighting i do not feel like cutting him to size my mind does not allow me to kill this boy
he is a great self his valour is also admirable he is focused in battle and highly tolerant there is no doubt that on account of his excellence even nagas yakshas and sages offer salutations to him
his mental horizon is enhanced by his valour and power he is standing before me and dares to look into my eyes surely his swift movement and valour will shake even the minds of suras and asuras
if i ignore him now he would get the better of me i have to consider his challenge seriously his valour in the battle is growing it is proper to subdue him now a spreading fire cannot be neglected
reflecting on the power of the enemy the mighty and valiant vanara thought of his own course of action hanuman made up his mind to kill the enemy and increased his speed
hanuman the brave son of the windgod hit with his palm and killed the eight horses yoked to akshas chariot which had great speed were stable and had the capacity to bear heavy loads while turning round in the sky the battle was fought in the air since hanuman leaped into the air and the demon hero had to resist him there
then hit by hanuman with his palm the minister of the copperyeyed sugriva the huge chariot seat of aksha was broken the wooden frame of the yoke was disjointed horses were slain and the great chariot fell down from the sky
thereupon hanuman with the prowess that was equal to wind approaching the sky firmly caught hold of the legs of aksha flying into the abode of garuda the windgod and the siddhas
hanuman the foremost of the vanaras who was equal to his father in valour seized him just as garuda the lord of birds would seize a great serpent and spinning him round speedily a thousand times and hitting him dropped him on the earth
hit by hanuman the ogres arms thighs hips and neck broken bones rendered to fragments eyes protruded joints disjointed tendons strewn he was thrown down on the earth dripping blood
when the great vanara dashed aksha down on to the earth the king of demons was struck with terror the great sages who go round the planets great seers who were observants of vows yakshas panagas suras including indra all beings collected together and looked at the vanara with awe
hanuman the hero with bloodshot eyes having slain aksha shone resplendent like the son of indra jayanta and reached the portal and waited looking like the god of death determined to destroy all beings      thus ends the fortyseventh sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
thereafter the great demon king mighty angry at the death of aksha in the hands of hanuman controlled his feeling and ordered indrajit who was like a godhead
you are an expert in wielding astras missiles and foremost among the wielders of weapons you are highly efficient you have brought grief even to suras and asuras you are a warrior of proven ability demonstrated in your war against the gods including indra by propitiating through penance grandfather brahma you have acquired many missiles
none could face you in war including indra maruts and gods because of your skill and the power of your astras
excepting you there is none who has not experienced fatigue in war in the three worlds you alone are intelligent in fighting you are protected by the strength of your arms and power of austerity you are aware of the proper place and time of action
nothing is impossible for you in war you do not consider with your wise judgment any action unfit for undertaking there is none in all the three worlds who is unaware of the strength of your weapons and your power to recall through mantra the weapon you have discharged
the power of your penance your valour and your ability to discharge astras in war is equal only to mine i am not bothered about the consequences of war you wage because your victory is certain
your dear young brother aksha is killed o scourage of enemies i do not have the faith in them as i have in you
o intelligent warrior measure the strength power and valour of the monkey and your own strength carefully exercise your own strength and speed accordingly
o warrior of extraordinary merit among the wielders of astras asses your strength approach the enemy in a manner by which he is subdued without causing further destruction to our army carefully measure your own strength and your enemys before you start fighting
o hero take no large army as it is futile with this monkey endowed with extraordinary vigour even a thunderbolt can do nothing he is like the wind and has no match in speed he is like the sacrificial fire who cannot be destroyed by weapons
i am reluctant to send you to war in the circumstances but you are the best choice for me however certainly this is the duty of a kshatriya who follows the science of polity hence i am sending you
o subduer of enemies you are capable of handling different kinds of weapons therefore understand that i seek only your ultimate triumph in war
hearing the fathers words of exhortation he who is never distressed at the prospect of war decided to seek the battle as he was powerful like the son of daksha and went round his father with respect
having been honoured by his own kith and kin who loved him indrajit rushed forth for war with martial vigour
when the illustrious son of ravana the highly indrajit resplendent with eyes of lotus petals marched ahead he looked like the turbulent ocean on a fullmoon day
like indra indrajit ascended the chariot which had the standard of indra as it was seized from him as a token of his having conquered indra yoked to four sharptoothed tigers it moved in swiftness vying with garuda the king of birds in speed
mounted on the chariot indrajit the best in archery and an expert in weaponry went quickly to the place where that great hanuman was stationed
the leader of the monkey also became happier on hearing the rumbling of the chariot and the twang of indrajits bowstring
indrajit who was an adept in warfare picked his highly powerful bow and aimed his sharpedged arrow at hanuman
when he sallied forth happily holding a bow full of passion for war darkness prevailed in all quarters and it became gloomy beasts began to howl in various frightful ways
to see the combat the nagas yakshas seers and siddhas who move round the heavenly orbits assembled in the sky the birds collected in flocks in the sky and screeched loudly and happily
hanuman of very high speed enlarged his body and roared perceiving indrajits chariot coming swiftly
indrajit on his part sat in his divine chariot holding a wonderful bow and in a lightning speed twanged it
then the son of the demon king and hanuman both very fast in speed mighty and powerful fearless in war and like sura and asura closed in upon each other
hanuman of immeasurable strength heaved himself to a huge proprtion and went moving on the path of his father windgod rendering useless the extraordinary speed of the arrows of indrajit who was great in chariot warfare and an efficient archer
then the heroic indrajit slayer of enemy warriors discharged long arrows that were fixed with find feathers with sharppointed gold tips bent a little at the tip touching the bow string as swift as lightning
thereupon hearing the rumbling of the chariot the sounds of mrudangas bheris and patahas drawing towards him and percieving the loud twang of the bow of indrajit hanuman sprang up again
the great tawny monkey moved quickly between spaces of arrows that were aimed at him rendering hosts of indrajits targets futile
hanuman son of the windgod again stood facing the arrows directly stretching his hands and jumped into the air
both the warriors endowed with speed and skill in warfare carried on the fight which captivated the minds of all creatures
the demon did not find a way to hit hanuman maruti also found no opportunity to hit great indrajit both of them being equal to gods in valour became too much to each other in war both of them moved at meteoric speed making it difficult to aim at the enemy
indrajits infallible arrows missed hanuman then the great warrior became perplexed and started thinking seriously within himself entering into a reflective mood
then indrajit son of the demon king thinking that a vanara should not be killed started considering other means of catching hm
then the heroic master of weapons an excellent and glorious warrior directed the brahmastram towards the foremost of monkeys
indrajit the strongarmed hero who knew the secrets of all missiles realising that the son of the windgod cannot be killed caught him by the divine weapon of brahma brahmastram
then hanuman bound by the weapon of the demon was unable to move and fell on the ground
the monkey leader realised that his speed was arrested by the power of the lord brahma by the strength of the bond of brahmastram he then recalled lord brahmas boon to him
hanuman realised that it was by invoking creator brahma and applying the mantra that he was caught by brahmastram on that occasion he started thinking of the boon given to him by grandsire brahma
i deem it an effect of the power of brahma it is not possiblle for me to free myself due to the power of the great lord presiding over the universe through the astra it should be obeyed
reflecting within himself about the power of the astra hanuman recalled brahams favour to him he recalled his own power to liberate himself from the brahmastra and resolved to abide by the order of brahma
even though i am bound by the astra i have the protection of both brahma and indra as well as the windgod hence there is no cause for apprension
if i am caught by the demon i will have the opportunity to see the demon lord therefore let me be caught by my enemies
hanuman a destroyer of enemies who assesses before he acts resolved to submit to the ordinance of brahma to be silent the power of his movement affected when the enemy forces came to him slowly and slowly siezed him forcibly and abused him he roared
then the ogres had hanuman the subduer of enemies who made no effort to move bound with hemp rope and bark robes
bound by the enemy warriors hanuman decided to bear all humiliations thinking may be the demon king might come to see me out of curiosity if he is so disposed
on being bound by bark ropes hanuman was set free from the bond of brahmastra since the bondage of brahmastra does not tolerate another ordinary bondage
then the heroic indrajit coming to know that the foremost of the monkeys bound by bark ropes was released from the bondage of brahmastra thought indeed the divine weapon does not tolerate other bonds so the vanara is released
though binding and dragging by the ogres had hurt hanuman he on his part did not know that he had been released from brahmastra
the cruel ogres hit hanuman with sticks and fists and dragged him to the presence of the demon lord
then indarjit seeing the powerful hanuman the foremost of monkeys who was released from the brahmastra still bound by bark ropes presented him to the ogres and their master in the royal assembly
the ogres presented the best of monkeys hanuman looking like an elephant in rut to ravana the demon king
who is he whose son is he why has he come here where has he come from what business does he have here thus the heroic demons talked among themselves
thereafter other ogres angrily said let us kill him burn him or otherwise devour him thus they spoke to one another
the great hanuman moving quickly and crossing the path came near the feet of the king he saw the aged and experienced ministers of the king and the palace of the king adorned with precious gems
resplendent ravana saw the ogres of ugly appearance dragging the foremost of the monkeys here and there
hanuman the best of monkeys also saw the demon king who had both splendour and strength radiating brilliance like the sun
that tenheaded rakshasa king rolling his red eyes rapidly in rage and observing the monkey unwinkingly ordered the noble and aged ministers of his clan to interrogate hanuman
at the very outset they questioned hanuman manner in the usual about the place he came from and the purpose hanuman reported i am hanuman i came as a messenger by the order of the king of monkeys     thus ends the fortyeigth sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
the highly courageous hanuman astonished at the action of binding and dragging him to the court by the demon king looked at him with eyes turned red in anger
hanuman looked at ravana of innate splendour who shone with a glittering crown of gold glowing encircled with strings of pearls
he was decked with wonderful golden ornaments studded with diamonds and had small motifs of precious gems fixed to them they were as though designed by imagination an ornament made with the hand connot be so fine and delicate
he was dressed in exquisite silk and smeared with red sandal paste and had many ornamental designs drawn on his body with fragrant unguents
he appeared terrible with bloodred eyes shining sharp big teeth drooping lips and ten heads which looked like ten peaks of mountain mandara inhabited by various beasts he was heroic powerful and splendid
he was like a black mountain of collyrium and with a face like the fullmoon with a pearl necklace illumining his chest he appeared like a cloud lit up by the fullmoon with white cranes flying across the white pearlnecklace moving on his chest appeared like a row of cranes flying through the black cloud
adorned with armlets keyura smeared with choicest sandal paste his shining stout armlets appeared like many fivehooded serpents fingers appearing like hoods
he was seated on a huge magnificent throne of crystal encrusted with precious stones and overspread with a wonderful carpet
young and beautiful girls decorated exceedingly well holding whisks all over the vicinity attended on him
he was attended by durdhara prahasta mahaparsva and nikumbha who were his learned ministers seated comfortably and attended by the four arrogant ministers he was puffed with pride of their strength and appeared like the entire world surrounded by four oceans
he was attended by ogres including ministers who were intellectuals and adept in counselling he appeared like lord indra attended by the gods
hanuman saw the highly resplendent giant king seated on the throne who appeared like a cloud laden with water appearing on the peak of mount meru
hanuman looked at the demon king with great amazement even while he was dealt harshly by the demons of fierce valour
seeing the splendour of the lord of demons hanuman was dimayed and started thinking thus
oh what charm what courage what strength what splendour how great is this demonking an endowment of all merits
if only this lord of demons was not unrighteous he could have become even the lord protector of gods including indra
this ravana has done many cruel fierce and contemptible deeds that is why even the demons gods and all the people of this world get scared of him he will render the entire world into a single ocean when he turns angry
many such thoughts crossed hanumans intelligent mind on seeing ravanas brilliance and power     thus ends the fortyninth sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
the mighty armed ravana a tormentor of all worlds overcome with anger beheld the tawnyeyed brilliant lord of monkeys who stood before him and started thinking in his mind full of apprehensions
is he lord nandi who came here in person i was earlier cursed by him when i shook the mount kailasa in the past could he have assumed a monkeyform or may be he is the great demon bana nandi is the bull the vehicle of lord siva
the infuriated demon king told the great minister prahasta these profound words in a brief manner appropriate to the hour
enquire from this wicked one why he has come and from where why he destroyed the garden and for what purpose he threatened the demonesses
enquire why this wicked one entered this inviolable city and for what purpose did he wage a war
on hearing ravana prahasta spoke these words boosting the monkeys morale o monkey be relaxed feel safe you need not entertain any fear
have you came to the abode of ravana sent by indra speak the truth be not afraidyou will be released
your appearance is only of that of a vanara but your glow is not of a vanara indeed tell the truth today you will be set free
if you tell a lie it will be difficult for you to live or else tell me for what reason have you entered the abode of ravana
the foremost of the vanaras spoke to the lord of ogres in response to the equiries made to him i have not come from indra or yama or varuna i have no friendship with kubera i have not been sent by visnu by birth i am vanara and i have come here
desiring to fight with me the powerful ogres came then i fought in self defence
it is not possible to bind me with any bondage of astras even by devas or danavas such a boon has been granted to me by grandfather brahma
wishing to see the king i honoured this astra and not otherwise even though i was tormented by the ogres and released by the astra i submitted to you as i have a small work assigned by the king
know that i am a messenger of the highly powerful rama o lord please listen to these beneficial words of mine meant for your welfare     thus ends the fiftieth sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
hanuman the best of monkeys looking at the very powerful ravana spoke slowly these highly meaningful words
o lord of demons i reached your realm here by the orders of sugriva lord of monkeys who is like your brother he conveys his good wishes to you
the great sugriva who is like your brother sends you a message pertinent to this world and the other world that which is beneficial and consistent with righteousness and propriety  and  listen
there was an emperor named dasaratha richly endowed with chariots horses and elephants he was a friend to the world and was like a father and equal to indra in splendour
his eldest son a highly effulgent one named rama who was dear to the king accepting his fathers orders went into exile with brother lakshmana and wife sita also accepting a righteous path and entered dandaka forest
sita daughter of king janaka of videha kingdom loyally followed her husband rama she was lost in the forest
searching for the divine lady the prince reached mount rshyamuka along with his brother and there he met sugriva
sugriva promised rama to undertake search for sita and rama assured sugriva of securing him the kingdom of the monkeys
then prince rama killed vali in battle and made sugriva king of the vanaras and bears and restored the kingship of sugriva
you know of vali chief of the vanaras in the past rama killed him with a single arrow in the combat
sugriva who is true to his word and a faithful warrior king of monkeys anxiously sent vanaras in all directions for searching sita
hundreds thousands and unlimited number of monkeys are searching for sita in all directions in the underworld and heavens and the sky
some of the very powerful heroes equal to garuda equal to the windgod in swiftness have gone in quest of sita without touching the earth
i marutas son hanuman by name too came swiftly leaping across a hundred yojanas across the ocean searching for sita
while i was roaming i saw janakas daughter sita at your houseyou are a knower of the truth of righteousness you are very wise and carrried out great austerities it does not behove you to abduct another mans wife
indeed respectable people and wise men like you should not indulge in actions opposed to righteousness as it will strike at the very root of your existence
who even among gods and asuras can withstand the arrows released by lakshmana in obedience to the infuriated ramas orders
o king there is none in these three worlds who can enjoy happiness by displeasing rama
think that my advice is beneficial to you for you present past and future it is righteous it will provide you material wealth too hence return sita to the lord of the people
i have actually spotted the divine lady here which was most difficult rama will plan the remaining course of action
i have seen sita immersed in deep sorrow you do not realise that by abducting her you are keeping a fivehooded female serpent in your house
just as food mixed with venom cannot be digested by the great fire fire of hunger it is not possible to keep sita even by gods and demons sita is like food mixed with poison ravana cannot digest her with all his power
you have acquired the merit of righteousness by prolonged hardships experienced during your penance it is not proper to forfeit your own life in this way
you know you will not be killed by asuras or gods in that case also this keeping sita with you may be the prime cause of your death
sugriva is not an demon nor a danava nor gandharva nor a yaksha nor even a pannaga therefore how can you save your life from sugriva
the fruit of dharma does not accrue to one who has reached the culmination of adharma unrighteousness will destroy the fruits of righteousness
there is no doubt you have earned merit through righteousness dharma destroys adharma and yields sweet fruit ultimately but now you will quickly reap the result of your unrighteousness also
you know about the killing of all ogres at janasthana and of vali also you know about the alliance of rama and sugriva you may decide on a proper course of action for the sake of your own welfare
alone i can destroy this entire lanka teeming with horses chariots and elephants indeed i have the energy but not the mandate of sri rama
rama made a vow in the presence of bears and vanaras that he would exterminate the arrogant enemy troops by whom sita is abducted and assaulted
indra the destroyer of enemy citadels cannot live happily if he offends rama what to speak of persons like you
sita who is under your custody is no ordinary lady she is indeed the dark night of dissolution destroyer of entire lanka know this
stop holding the noose of death in sitas form whom you yourself have placed on your shoulders think of your own welfare
visualize this city of lanka including its marketplaces and main streets as burnt by sitas power of chastity and ramas anger
do not pave the path of your friends ministers clan brothers and sisters sons wellwishers wives and luxuries and lanka to destruction
o king of demon listen to the words of truth of the servant of rama his messenger and specially a vanara
illustrious rama can put an end to and dissolve all creatures including both movable and immovables of all worlds he can recreate all of them in the same way he has such superhuman powers
he is equal to visnu in valour there is none who can dare face his rage be it among gods asuras yakshas rakshasas vidyadharas gandharvas uragas siddhas kings of kinnaras birds and all beings at all places and at all times
rama is the supreme lord of all worlds a lion among kings having pained him it is very difficult for you to sustain your life after offending him to this extent
o king of demons even devas daityas gandharvas vidyadharas nagas and yakshas are incompetent to face rama the lord of the three worlds in wars
even the selfborn fourfaced brahma the threeeyed siva who destroyed tripura mahendra the king of suras do not have the power to save one whom rama decides to kill
the tenheaded ravana who was of matchless strength hearing the unpleasant words of advice and warning expressed skilfully with dignity by the great hanuman enraged ravana his eyes rolling in anger ordered the execution of hanuman     thus ends the fiftyfirst sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
hearing the great vanaras speech ravana overwhelmed with anger ordered the execution of hanuman
vibhishana did not approve of the killing of hanuman who had declared that he was an envoy of sri rama when the wicked ravana ordered his murder
vibhishana who stood by the right course of action having realised that the lord of demons was angry pondered over his duty
then vibhishana who was skilled in speech having decided about his duty addressed his reverential elder brother a conqueror of enemies in soothing words in a meaningful wholesome manner
o king of ogres give up your wrath forgive and calm down please listen to my appeal you know the basic values of life virtuous rulers of the earth do not order killing of an envoy
mighty king killing this hanuman is contrary to righteousness of kings this is deplorable diplomacy and also unbecoming of you
you are conversant with dharma of a king you have a sense of gratitude you are a knower of right and wrong of all beings the supeme truth
if wise persons like you are also overpowered by unjust anger then the mastery of the scriptures will become a mere fruitless exercise
o destroyer of foes o unassailable king of demon calm down only after carefully considering what is proper and improper decide on the punishment to be imposed
ravana the lord of demons heard vibhishanas words and overcome with anger replied
o slayer of foes it is not wrong to kill a sinner i shall therefore kill the sinful vanara
on hearing his brothers harsh words spoken in tremendous anger which were not acceptable to noble souls wise vibhishana again spoke these words of supreme truth
o lord of lanka o king of demons be pleased to listen to my words which are the essence of dharma and artha the elders have declared that the emissaries should not be killed by any means
this enemy has done a lot of harm no doubt indeed he has done terrible and unpleasant deeds yet the wise have recommended many alternate punishments while prohibiting their killing
mutilation of limbs flogging shaving of the head and deforming limbs etc these punishments have been prescribed for an emissary never has killing of an emissary been heard
you are wellversed in dharma and artha learned men first decide what is right or wrong before imposing punishment how are you swayed by unjust anger indeed courageous persons like you should control anger
heroic ravana there is hardly any one who is equal to you in the knowledge of dharma in the practice of worldly affairs and in grasping subtle truths of sastras indeed you are supreme among suras and asuras
you are the king of demons hosts of gods and daityas efficient in wars are conquered by you again and again since you are a brave warrior invincible to gods and demons
i do not see any use in killing this monkey pronounce punishment on those who have sent this vanara
whether he is soft or harsh he has been sent by others he is speaking on others behalf and is dependent on them an emissary does not deserve to be killed
o king if he is killed i do not see any one who can cross this great ocean and come by air to reach this place
you who can conquer citadels of enemies should not direct your efforts to kill an envoyyou are fit to make efforts against enemies like gods including indra
o lover of war if hanuman is slain i do not see any one who can incite those two illmannered sons of the king who are prevented from reaching this faroff land
o delighter of demons even the gods and demons who are endowed with valour and energy cannot win you you are invincible it is not proper for you to lose chances of a good war
you have with you wellwishers courageous ones who have good qualities born in a good race who are noble sensible people wielders of weapons and wellpaid warriors in crores
by your order let some strong soldiers from one contingency go and capture the two sons of the king to exhibit your power over the enemy
the tenheaded ravana heard his brother the greatsoul vibhishanas timely advice which was in keeping with the laws of the land and replied
indeed you have spoken very wellkilling of emissary is censured in sastras surely we will impose suitable punishment other than killing
the tail is dear to the monkeys and it is an ornament for them set fire to it at once and let him go with his burning tail
then all his friends relatives and his kinsmen will see his disfigured and handicapped form the demon king having ordered thus the monkey was taken by the ogres round the junctions of the roads all over the city with his tail on fire
obeying the orders of the king the brutally angry demons wrapped his tail with tatters of cotton
while the tail was being swathed the great vanara grew in size like wild fire fed with dry firewood
the demons soaked the tail and set fire to it his face burning in anger shone like the rising sun and his mind seized with indignation he struck them with the burning tail
all the demons including the shedemons and their children and the elders went out joyfully to see the burning tail of hanuman
when the cruel demons collected together and bound him once again the heroic hanuman thought what was appropriate to the moment
even though these ogres are not capable they have bound me indeed i will leap into the air once again and sever my bonds and kill them
these evilminded demons bind me ordered by their lord when i am moving here for the welfare of my master i will not let them escape
i am strong enough to destroy all the demons in a battle i am enduring this humiliation in order to make rama happy in this way i will get a chance to see lanka once again
indeed i saw lanka at night for which i could not acquire proper knowledge about the fortification of the city surely it should be seen by me now after the night has passed
let the demons torture me freely by setting fire to my tail let them bind me i am not exhausted
then the ogres set forth joyfully capturing the very powerful elephant among the monkeys the great vanara who had contracted his body
the cruel demons started blowing conches and beating drums they paraded him in the city announcing their deeds
hanuman the subduer of enemies ranged forth happily while he was followed by the demons in the great city
the great vanara saw wonderful towering mansions secure mammoth buildings all over and welllaid out squares on the streets
the son of the windgod saw the streets with beautiful tall mansions and houses appearing like clouds highways and byways and secret routes
all the demons went forth through cross roads altars built on four pillars and royal roads announcing that he hanuman was a spy
with eagerness to have a glance at hanumans blazing tail women children and the aged here and there came out of eagerness to see him
when the tip of hanumans tail was set on fire the uglyeyed shedemon carried the unpleasant news to divine sita
o sita the redfaced monkey who conversed with you is being paraded in the streets with his tail set on fire
distressed on hearing the news which was as cruel as her own abduction sita started burning with grief and invoked the firegod
wishing the great monkey well the largeeyed sita invoked the firegod in her heart
o firegod if i have served my husband if i have practised austerities and if i am loyal to my husband be cool to hanuman
if wise rama has some compassion for me if there is any residue of good luck for me to hanuman be cool o firegod
o firegod if rama is righteous if i am pure in mind and if i am longing to unite with him be cool to hanuman
if sugriva is true to his promise to fight for me if he should be able to rescue me from this ocean of agony let hanuman be cool not consumed by fire
then the tips of the intense flame appeared steadily moving to the fawneyed sita indicating the firegods auspiciousness and safety to hanuman
the windgod accompanying hanumans firelit tail also blew cool like the wind from snow to calm the mind of the divine lady
when the tail was burning the vanara wondered how the fire ablaze on every side was not burning him
this huge flame is not hurting me it is as though a mass of ice is placed at the end of my tail the fire did not torture nor extend beyond the tip of my tail
it must be due to the power of rama by which i found a wonderful mountain emerging from the sea to give me protection while i was crossing the ocean now evidently this is due to ramas power that my tail is not burning me
if the anxiety of the ocean and the wise mainaka mountain is to serve rama what is it that the fire cannot do
because of sitas steadfast loyalty ramas power and my fathers friendship with the firegod the fire is not burning me
once more a thought came to the great hanumanthe elephant among monkeys he sprang up and shouted loud
then the illustrious hanuman reached the entrance of the lofty city which was like the peak of a mountain and turned away the demons
from his mountainlike form he assumed his original small figure within a moment casting off the bonds
illustrious hanuman was relieved of the bond and once again grew to a mountain size looking around he saw an iron club near the archway
seizing the black iron club again the strongarmed hanuman killed all the demon guards
hanuman who was of fearsome valour in war with the demons having killed them gazed at lanka once again garlanded by the flames of his tail around he shone like the sun covered with garlands of rays      thus ends the fiftythird sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
with his objectives achieved the monkey gazed at lanka with growing zeal and pondered over the remaining work
is there anything still left which can further torment the demons here
if the citadel is destroyed it would be a happy conclusion with a little effort i can successfully complete my task
it would be proper to satiate this fire at the end of my tail by offering it to these excellent mansions i shall set fire to these houses
the great hanuman with his burning tail wandered on tops of the mansions of lanka which looked like clouds with lightning
the vanara moved from one house to the other looking at the gardens and houses of the demons without fear
powerful and brave hanuman who was equal to the windgod in speed jumped down on the house of prahasta and set fire to it from there he jumped on to mahaparsvas house and set it ablaze hanuman appeared like the fireflame at the time of dissolution
the great brilliant vanara bounded on to vajradamstras of sukas and wise saranas
thus hanuman the chief of the vanaras set fire to indrajits residence and then to jambumalis and sumalis building
the brilliant monkey leader bypassed vibhishanass house and avoiding it that way set fire to the mansions of other ogres rasmiketu suryasatru hrasvakarna vajradamshtra romasa yuddhonmatta matta dhwajagriva vidyujjihva hastimukha karala pisacha sonitaksha kumbhakarna makaraksha yagnasatru brahmasatru naranthaka kumbha and wicked nikumbha
moving among those highly luxurious mansions the glorious vanara burnt away the wealth of all the rich demons
heroic and illustrious hanuman having crossed all the residences of the ogres finally reached the palace of ravana the king
then hanuman the hero with the burning tail set fire to the chief palace of ravana that resembled mountains meru and mandara decorated with different kinds of gems and exquisite with several auspicious articles while the flames were rising up he roared like the thundering cloud at the time of dissolution
the windgods association made the fire spread at great speed it appeared like fire at the time of dissolution
combined with the wind the fire began to spread burning the houses with great speed
the palatial structures with windows of golden meshwork embedded with pearls and gems and other precious stones tumbled
unable to protect their rich houses and thoroughly disappointed the demons said alas the firegod came in the form of a vanara a tumultuous sound arose
a few shedemons at once jumped out of their burning mansions surrounded by fire they held their breastfeeding babies in their arms their hair let loose shouting as they jumped as they were alighting they glowed like lightnings dropping from the clouds
hanuman saw many colourful molten minerals mixed with diamonds corals vaiduryas pearls and silver flowing dropping from every mansion
just as fire is not satisfied with dry sticks and grass hanuman was not satisfied with the dead demons
the flames of fire were shining like kimsuka flowers here like salmali wood there and like saffron flowers elsewhere
hanuman endowed with great speed burnt lanka just as tripurari or rudra burnt thetripuras three cities of gold silver and iron
the fierce fire lit by hanuman the hero endowed with great speed spread around in circles and shot up flying high to the top of the trikuta mountain on which lanka was located
fanned by the wind inflamed by the fat from the corpses of the demons the fire spread in the mansions burning without smoke it spread with great speed like the fire at the end of the universe
the highly radiant fire stood like a crore of suns surrounding the entire lanka it was glowing cracking like indras thunderbolt as though the whole universe was collapsing
the dazzling flames of fire red like kimsuka flowers shot up violently into the sky the clouds engulfed by the smoke rising from the subsiding fire was shining like the lustre of blue lotuses
is this the wielder of thunderbolt indra who is the king of gods is it yama himself is it the windgod or firegod or varuna or rudra is it kubera or sun or moon or is it the god of death himself he cannot be a mere monkey indeed
or is it grandfather brahma the supreme fourfaced god enraged and arrived in the form of vanara to kill the clan of demons
can he be the vast boundless energy the unthinkable and infinite lord visnu assuming the monkeyform is he the peerless unmanifest form beyond all imagination who has arrived here by virtue of his maya illusory power in order to destroy the demons
all eminent demons having collected together quickly surveyed the situationseeing the burnt city with all its living creatures houses and trees consigned to the flames they spoke to one another
lanka with its chariots horses elephants flocks of birds animals and trees burnt all of a sudden the ogres cried loudly and piteously
o father dear o son o my dear o friend alas the life which is enjoyable sacred and prosperous is destroyed in this way saying this the demons cried out dreadfully and loudly
with the fire god spreading flames all over heroes dead retreating troops shattered by hanumans anger lanka appeared as though it was cursed
highly sensitive hanuman saw the city of lanka filled with perplexed scared and sorrowful demons lanka succumbed to the flames of firegod and looked as if it was hit by the anger of brahma the selfborn god
hanuman son of the windgod stood at ease having shattered the garden that was full of excellent trees and killed the demons and burnt down rows of beautiful houses in the city
standing on the peak of trikuta mountain with his tail burning like the aura of the sun the lion among vanaras looked resplendent like the sun surrounded by his rays
great hanuman sought ramas presence in his mind after killing many demons breaking down many trees of the garden and setting fire to the mansions of demons
all the gods praised the vanara chief son of the windgod who was powerful wise and efficient and had the speed of the wind
hanuman destroyed the garden killed the demons burnt the city of lanka and was shining with delight
the gandharvas gods siddhas and great sages were amazed at seeing the burning city of lanka
all beings were afraid of hanuman thinking that he was the fatal fire consuming worlds at the hour of dissolution
all gods great sages gandharvas vidyadharas nagas and yakshas and all great beings experienced supreme joy     thus ends the fiftyfourth sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
powerful hanuman having burnt the entire city of lanka put out the fire on his tail in the ocean beholding the burning city the destroyed gardens and the panic stricken ogres he began to think
overtaken by great fear hanuman felt a sense of selfreproach seeing lanka reduced to ashes and said lanka is burnt what a heinous action has been perpetrated by me
blessed indeed are the highsouled men who in their wisdom restrain their own anger as one would put off burning fire with water
which sinful act an angry man will not commit he will even kill his respectable elders or insult sages with his harsh tongue
fie upon me a wicked shameless person and the greatest sinner for betraying the master and setting fire to the city without thinking of sita
if this lanka is burnt even noble janaki is burnt my masters work is spoilt by me unknowingly
my very mission is foiled sita has not been protected by me for no part of lanka has escaped unburnt
surely janaki has perished in lanka for not even a little place is left unburnt the entire city is reduced to ashes
if my work has been destroyed by my perversity of judgement i will give up my life now and here itself
shall i end my life by jumping into fire just now or else into the mouth of submarine fire should i offer my body to the living creatures of the ocean as their food
having spoilt the entire work how can i show my face to the king of monkeys how is it possible to see both the tigers among men
on account of my mistake of yielding to anger i have exhibited the unstable monkeynature and made it well established in the three worlds
fie upon my hasty action commited due to lack of selfcontrol i did not save sita eventhough the entire situation was under my control i had the capacity to save her but i failed due to anger
if the two princes know about sitas loss they will die and when they are dead sugriva would perish along with all his relatives
how will the loving righteous brother bharata along with satrughna survive after hearing this
when the righteous ikshvaku race perishes the people would be tormented by grief and remorse there is no doubt
i have failed in seeking dharma and artha it is evident is that i am a destroyer of the world because i was overtaken by anger how unfortunate i am
when hanuman was thus bemoaning good omens as in the past appeared before him he started reflecting once again
on the other hand a beautiful and auspicious lady like sita will be protected by her own splendour and will not perish as fire cannot extinguish fire sita is pure like fire here the great sage valmiki is suggesting the future incident in which sita emerged safe from agnipariksha or fireordeal
fire cannot touch that lady who is protected by her own chastity and who is wedded to the righteous man of immasureable glory
fire the consumer of oblations who has the property of burning has not burnt me and this is surely on account of ramas power and vaidehis merits
to bharata lakshmana and satrughna she is a goddess and she is dear to ramas heart how would she perish
if not so the firegod who never fails in burning has not burnt my tail how will he burn noble sita
then hanuman thought of the appearance of mountain hiranyanabha in the midst of water a wonderful phenomenon
by virtue of her power of asceticism power of truthfulness and exclusive devotion towards her husband she may consume the fire fire will not burn her
as hanuman was thinking so he heard the words of the great charanas who were praising the queens power of righteousness
oh hanuman has indeed accomplished the marvellous task of spreading the terrific fire on the demons buildings
the city is crowded with women children and old demons running in a bid to save themselves the loud wails of demons resounded in the mountaincaves it was as if the city was shrieking loudly
the city with its towering markets ramparts and portals is burnt but janaki is not it is really wonderful strange
with omens that proved to be right and for good reasons and from the words of the sages charanas hanuman felt happy
hanuman having fulfilled his desires and knowing that sita is not hurt thought of departing after meeting sita once again to testify that she is really safe     thus ends the fiftyfifth sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
then hanuman offered salutations to janaki stationed at the foot of the simsupa tree and said luckily i see you unscathed
looking at hanuman again and again as he was ready to start on his return journey thus spoke sita expressing her love for her husband
o destroyer of foes you are capable of rescuing me singlehanded your success will raise your strength and bring glory
if kakutstha rama the slayer of enemy forces comes to lanka fills it with his arrows and takes me back it will be worthy of him
you should act in such a manner that the exalted rama who is chivalrous in the battlefield exhibits his valour worthy of his stature
hearing her meaningful reply which was welldisposed and reasonable hanuman replied
rama will come soon with the best of vanaras and bears he would win the battle and remove your sorrrow
hanuman son of the windgod having consoled vaidehi saluted her respectfully and decided to depart
then hanuman the crusher of enemies a tiger among vanaras anxious to see his lord ascended the mount arishta
mount arishta was full of blue forestranges with choicest tall padmaka trees with clouds hanging on the slopes of mountain peaks it appeared as though the mountain was wrapped in an upper garment
as if the mountain was awakened from sleep by the rays of the blessed sun with the colour of glowing minerals exuding it was as if the mountain was looking out with his eyes open the minerals underneath the mud appear when wind blows removing the dust covering them the glowing minerals are fancied to be eyes of the mountain
with the loud sounds of masses of gurgling waters the mountain appeared as though it was standing and reciting the vedas loudly with murmuring sounds of different waterfalls it appeared as though the mountain was singing the sage differentiates the steadily trickling watersound from the rhythmic musical sounds of waterfalls
with the tall devadaru trees on the mountain it appeared as if the sages were standing with shoulders lifted up and performing penance the sounds of waterfalls filled all over with reverberations
the mountain appeared as if trembling with the dark clouds of autumn the shrill sounds pasing through the hollow bamboos filled with air appeared as if it was producing sweet musical notes
the mountain was as though hissing like a dreadful poisonous snake with the caves standing majestically covered with mist the mountain appeared as if it was meditating
with the ranges of foothills appearing like the feet of clouds traversing with its peaks like garlands of clouds traversing over the mountain it made one feel it was yawning
with many kinds of caves and peaks scattered all over the mountain looked delightful it was canopied with numerous trees like sal palms aswakarnas and bamboos
it was spread with creepers filled with beautiful flowers and herds of animals the colourful minerals flowing down decorated the mountain
there were many streams of water flowing and rocks making it difficult for the streams to flow the mountain was inhabited by sages yakshas gandharvas kinnaras and nagas and uragas
the clusters of creepers and trees bearing tasty fruits and roots were uprooted there were caves inhabited by lions herds of tigers were scattered all over by the impetus of hanumans pressure on the mountain
anxious to see rama soon the son of the windgod ascended the mountain happily
crushed under hanumans feet the rocks making a loud noise on the beautiful mountain ranges rolled down reduced to powder
on ascending the king of mountains desiring to reach the northern shore of the saltwater ocean from the southern shore he enlarged his body in preparation to leap
then the heroic son of the windgod who had ascended the mountain saw the dreadful ocean inhabited by fishes and snakes
hanuman the tiger among monkeys leaped into the sky like the windgod from the south to the north shore
pressed under the feet of hanuman the great mountain made loud sound sinking into the earth along with all its creatures with its shaken mountain peaks and uprooted trees dropping down
shaken by the violent force of hanumans thighs the blossoming trees fell on the ground like sickmen hit by indras thunderbolt
the dreadful roar of strong lions lying in mountaincaves was heard cracking the sky when they were crushed in the turmoil
the vidyadharis with their clothes slipped and ornaments disarrayed in fear at once flew from the mountain
highly powerful huge and poisonous snakes with their glowing tongues protruded pressed on their heads and necks by hanuman
then the kinnaras uragas gandhravas yakshas and vidyadharas left the tortured mountain and occupied the sky
crushed by the powerful hanuman that prosperous mountain with its trees standing and tall peaks sank into the underworld
that mountain of ten yojanas in width and thirty yojanas in height got levelled with the earth
eager to leap the terrific ocean lashed by huge waves hitting the shore hanuman rose up effortlessly and jumped into the sky     thus ends the fiftysixth sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
hanuman leaped ike the windgod unwearied across the sky as a huge boat crosses an ocean the ocean was graced with a swan the sky with constellation of swati with fullblown lotuses and water lilies like the nagas yakshas and gandharvas gathered together the moon in the sky was like a white lotus the sun like a waterfowl the auspicious tishya and shravana like the sweetvoiced swans and the clouds like duckweeds and green grassy spots on the shore the punarvasu star was like a large fish and the planet mars was like a crocodile airavata was like the great island the waves produced by the wind were like cool moonlight in the cold water
great hanuman son of the windgod flew through the abode of the windgod as if he was swallowing the space scratching the moon lord of the stars as if seizing the heavens along with the constellation of sun and stars and as though he was drawing the clusters of clouds
in contact with hanuman the clouds shone forth brilliantly in white and black in blue and yellow and in greenish red colour
with his exist and entrances into the mass of clouds his appearances and disappearances among the clouds he looked like the moon
passing through the clouds appearing and disappearing the heroic hanuman clad in white was like the moon in the white sky
as he made his way through flakes of clouds again and again appearing and disappearing hanuman the delight of the windgod shone in the sky roaring like a thundering cloud he looked like garuda
the glorious hanuman having killed eminent ogres and thereby making himself widely known having caused havoc to the city of lanka and terrific sorrow to ravana by tormenting the army offered salutations to vaidehi from midocean and continued his journey
the valiant hanuman touched the lord of mountains fondly and went with great speed just as an arrow released from the centre of a powerful bowstring
the chief of the monkeys arrived near and beholding the face of the mahendra mountain which resembled a mass of clouds thundered
the thundering noise of hanuman filled all the ten directions with great sound
having sighted the place of his companions and waiting to see them for long that tiger among monkeys made a loud noise and shook his tail in joy
by the terrific sounds made by hanuman in joy it seemed as though the pathway of garuda the sky along with the suns orbit was splitting
thereafter the brave and powerful monkeys waiting on the northern shore of the ocean for the arrival of the son of the windgod heard the roar and thundering sound of the stormy cloud produced by the sweeping motion of hanumans thighs propelled by the speed of his movement
all the vanaras who were feeling dejected and waiting anxiously heard the noise of hanuman that sounded like a thundering cloud
on hearing the loud voice of hanuman all the vanaras were longing to see their friend
jambavan the chief of vanaras became very happy at heart and called all the vanaras and spoke
oh hanuman is always successful if he has not he would not make sounds in this manner
hearing the sound of his dashing movements of arms and thighs the vanaras jumped about in joy then and there
the vanaras were very happy longing to see hanuman they jumped from one tree top to another and from one peak of a mountain to the other
waiting for hanuman the vanaras jumped from the tree tops holding the branches they shook the branches just like clothes to welcome friends
hanuman the powerful son of the windgod roared like the wind captured in a mountain cave would
on seeing hanuman who was resembling a heavy cloud approaching the vanaras stood with folded hands
thereafter the vanara who resembled a mountain descended with great speed on the summit of mount mahendra full of trees
overwhelmed with immeasurable joy hanuman descended from the sky like the mountain with its wings cut off and dropped on the bank of a mountain stream
feeling very happy at heart all the vanara leaders gathered around hanuman they stood motionless with extreme happiness
the vanaras were filled with joy seeing hanuman who returned unhurt they offered roots and fruits to him hanuman on his part offered salutations to the foremost of the monkeys
the great hanuman also offered salutations to elders preceptors such as jambavan and other leaders he also saluted the young angada
the valiant hanuman worthy of worship having been honoured by both jambavan and angada was pleased he responded briefly saying saw sita
then holding the hand of valis son he sat down at a beautiful location of the garden of mountain mahendra
hanuman felt happy and told angada the bull of vanaras i saw sita in the groves of ashoka guarded by dreadful ogres she is blameless eager to see rama she is wearing a single braid of hair she is young and emaciated due to fasting her hair is matted and soiled
then hearing hanumans meaningful and nectarlike words all the vanaras rejoiced
some powerful vanaras howled some chattered some roared and some screamed going round and round and others echoed the sounds
some elephantlike vanaras who were excited and felt overjoyed lifted their long and beautiful tails and hit them on the ground
a few vanaras jumped down from the mountain top and hugged the elephantlike hanuman
and hearing hanumans sweetest words angada addressed the heroic vanaras
o vanara you have leaped such a wide ocean and have returned in strength and valour there is none equal to you
o your devotion to the king o your valour fortitude and courage is admirable you could see ramas wife an illustrious lady this is a matter of our good luck rama will now shed the sorrow due to separation from sita
then the vanaras went round all the three angada hanuman and jambavan out of joy they lay down on the huge rocks
all the vanaras longing to listen to hanuman about his crossing the ocean seeing lanka sita and ravana kept looking at the face of hanuman
surrounded by many great vanaras angada was shining like indra lord of the gods attended by the gods in heaven
the mountain peak graced by famous hanuman and renowned angada bedecked with armlets seated on top joyfully appeared prosperous and splendid     thus ends the fiftyseventh sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
then the mighty hanuman and other vanaras having assembled on the summit of mountain mahendra and felt vey much happy
thereafter very delighted jambavan inquired hanuman most affectionately of all that happened
how did you find the godlike lady how was she how was the tenheaded one cruel in action behaving with her you may narrate what she said
o hanuman tell us in detail the entire thing on hearing it we will think about the next course of action
you are wise and you should tell us in detail what is to be told and what has to be hidden when we report
having been asked by jambavan and others hanuman with horripilations all over his body bowed down and saluted in the direction of queen sita and began
i rose upwards leaping into the sky intent on reaching the southern shore from the mountain mahendrait has been witnessed directly by all of you
even as i was leaping i saw a terrific and wonderful golden peak which came as if to obstruct me on my path
the mountain stood on my way turning towards me in order to obstruct me then i resolved in my mind that this great wonderful golden mountain has to be smashed
hit by my tail the great mountain peak which was radiating like the sun was shattered into a thousand pieces
perceiving that i am going to smash him he spoke to me in a sweet tone delighting my heart addressing me like a son
know me to be a friend of windgod and so i am like your fathers brother i am dwelling in this great ocean and known as mainaka
o son in the past foremost of the mountains too had wings and they used to range at will all over the earth tormenting all
mahendra the killer of ogre paka heard the story of the cruel deeds of mountains and cut off their wings into a thousand pieces with his thunderbolt
o son i was saved from indra by your kind father maruta who dropped me in this great ocean
o subduer of enemiesi must make efforts to help rama the foremost among the righteous for i have received help from your father who is equal to indra in valour
when i heard mainaka i told him about my intention to go up that great self mainaka allowed me
then the huge mountain in human form concealed as huge mountains remain hidden in the ocean
then with great speed i proceeded on my path it took a long time to cross the ocean
i saw surasa the mother of serpents in the midst of the ocean and she said
o powerful monkey you are destined to be my food provided by the immortals therefore i will eat you as i have i found you after a long time of unsatiated hunger
when addressed thus by surasa i bowed low with joined palms stood before her with my face turned pale and said
dasarathas son the illustrious rama a scorcher of enemies accompanied by his brother lakshmana and wife sita entered dandaka forest
his wife was abducted by the evilminded ravana by ramas command i am going to meet her as messenger from rama
i told her that it is proper for her living in the domain of rama to help his queen and wife or else i promised after i disclose to rama sitas whereabouts i will come and enter her mouth
when surasa said this i who was ten yojanas in height increased by fifteen yojanas
she too opened her mouth wide enough for my size seeing her distending her mouth in a moment i became small equal to the size of thumb and came out
then surasa assumed her natural form again in a moment and said this to me
o noble vanara o foremost of the vanaras go and accomplish the taskunite the great rama with vaidehio strongarmed vanara be happy i am pleased with you
then all creatures praised me saying well done well done then i leaped into the vast sky like garuda
then i was captured by a shadow of some one i could not see and i reduced my speed and looked around in all the ten directions i could not see the one who seized me
thinking so i looked down into the water and there i saw a terrific shedemon
she was frightening and laughed in loud voice without any hesitation steadfast she uttered these ominous words to me
o huge monkey where are you going i am hungry since long i am going without food and must eat you make me satisfied
i said well and enlarged my body more than her mouth could hold
she opened her huge mouth to eat me as she did not know that i had already assumed a huge ugly form on my own
in a moment i reduced from a huge form to a small one entered her heart and sprang into the sky
she who resembled a mountain fell into the ocean with her arms hanging down when i pulled out her heart
i heard the charanas and siddhas residing in the sky talking to each other that the fierce ogres simhika has been killed by hanuman in a moment
having slained simhika i thought of the huge feat that i have done i remembered the big mission before me and went to the southern shore of the ocean and saw lanka full of trees
then the frightening form with its hair burning like sacrificial fire emerged to kill me i defeated her hittting with my left fist and entered the city at sunset time
o hero i am the presiding deity of lanka whom you have won by your valour therefore you will win many demons she foretold
there when i went to the harem of ravana and searched all night i did not find the fairwaisted janakas daughter
not able to find sita at the residence of ravana i was immersed in an ocean of endless sorrow and did not know what to do
while worrying like that i saw a long golden boundary wall surrounding a splendid home garden upabana
i crossed that boundary wall and saw many kinds of trees and in the midst of that ashoka garden a huge simsupa tree i ascended it and saw rows of banana plants
not far from the simsupa tree i saw beautiful sita of dark complexion with eyes like lotus petals whose face was emaciated due to fasting wearing only a single sari the same one since her abduction her locks filled with dust pathetic looking immersed in sorrow meditating on her husband seated like a doe encircled by tigresses surrounded by ugly and cruel shedemons fed on flesh and blood
i remained there looking on that renowned wife of rama from the simsupa tree
then i heard a deep sound mixed with jingling golden girdles and anklets coming from ravanas residence
i was scared and contracted my body size and stood on the simsupa tree like a bird in the sky
then arrived the powerful ravana with his consorts to that place where sita was and stood there
on seeing ravana the king of demons beautiful sita full of fear hid her face and plump breasts between her thighs
sita was full of fear and worry looked here and there without any protector to pacify she was trembling in fear to that sita the tenheaded ravana bent his head down and said trust me and respect me
o sita if in your pride you do not respect me i will see drink your blood in two months
hearing the words of evilminded ravana sita became very angry and spoke these approprate words
o lowly demon i am the wife of valiant rama and daughterinlaw of dasaratha the king of ikshvaku race how is it your tongue that spoke unspeakable words has not fallen down
o ignoble one when my husband was away you came and abducted me unseen by the great rama you do not have even a little courage to win me through a straight fight
you are not equal to rama and not even fit to be his servant he does yagnas and always abides in truth he is valiant in war
thus addressed harshly by janaki the tenheaded ravana blazed up in anger suddenly like the flame of the funeral pyre
then the wicked ravana raised his eyebrows and his right fist to strike at sita and even the shedemon there raised their voice saying alas alas
evilminded ravanas wife mandodari a noble one among women came forward from the midst and prevented him
she spoke sweetly to ravana who was tormented by the god of love saying for what purpose do you desire sita you are equal to mahendra in might
o lord you enjoy with the daughters of gods gandharvas and even the young ladies of yakshas why do you need sita
then all the women got together and stopped the mighty nightranger ravana and quickly took him back to his mansion
janaki did not care for their words of threat as though they were a blade of grass and of no use to her
since the threatenings of the shedemons were of no use the ogresses who live on flesh and blood reported to ravana about great sitas formidable determination
then all of them gave up hope of their efforts and scattered around her succumbed to sleep
from the midst of all of them got up trijata saying you eat me if you like know that janakas daughter is a chaste woman and is the daughterinlaw of dasaratha she cannot be destroyed
today i saw in my dream a dreadful and horripilating scene of destruction of demons and even victory of sitas husband
to protect the demon clan from destruction by rama it is enough if we beg her pardon indeed i think that way
whoever in a sorrowful state sees such kind of dream would be not only relieved of all sorrows but will experience immense happiness janakas daughter sita will bless us with protection if we pray her
on hearing the words of trijata that rama will succeed young and bashful sita felt happy and said that if it comes true i will protect thee
seeing sitas deplorable state her illluck and her dread i began to worry and had no peace of mind
i thought of a strategy to enter into conversation with janaki that is to praise the ikshvaku race
the divine lady heard my enumeration sanctifying the royal seers she replied me with her eyes blinded by tears
o foremost of vanaras who are you why and how have you come here how did you make friendship with rama tell me all that in detail
hearing her i also said o queen sugriva the warrior of fierce valour and king of monkeys developed friendship with your husband
i came here as a servant sent by your tireless husband to find you
o glorious lady the tiger among men the illustrious son of dasaratha himself sent this ring to you as a taken of identity
o venerable lady i seek your order what should i do should i take you to rama and lakshmana what do you say
having heard all that hanuman said sita the delight of janaka thought over and said rama should kill ravana and take me
then bowing down i saluted the noble and blameless queen sita to give a signet which would be very pleasing to rama
sita then said to me take this best of gems and present it to the longarmed rama as a token
having said so the noble lady delivered a wonderful jewel with supreme message to me in a sorrowful mood
reminded by her again that rama should turn up soon to take her i offered reverential salutations by circumambulating her
o heroic hanuman narrate in such a way that by hearing you both rama and lakshmana will come here soon accompanied by sugriva
otherwise with none to protect me i will live only for two monthsi will die like an orphan and he will not see me
when i heard her pathetic appeal i was overtaken by anger i perceived the task left over for me to do
thereafter i increased my body to the size of a mountain intent on fighting and started destroying the pleasure garden
those uglyfaced ogresses woke up and saw the devastated garden and terrified beasts and birds
o powerful king an evilminded vanara has destroyed the inaccessible pleasure garden not knowing your valour
o king may orders be issued to kill this wickedminded vanara wandering aimlessly he has done contrary to your interest
ravana lord of the demons having heard the ogresses sent invincible ogres called kinkaras who know his mind
i killed with an iron bar a battalion of eighty thousand demons who were guarding the garden with tridents and maces
those who were left behind the less powerful ones went and reported to ravana that the great army has been killed
then a thought struck my mind i took hold of a pillar of the tall decorated mansion of lanka and killed with it all the hundred demons stationed there
with a dreadful iron bar i slayed jambumali who was endowed with mighty strength and was an expert in war and other terrific ogres who accompanied him
ravana the demon king sent his mighty army of strong footsoldiers the sons of ministers
i sent all of them to the abode of yama with just an iron bar having heard about the death of the less powerful ones ravana sent five heroic army generals
since i killed all of them along with the army the tenheaded ravana sent out his mighty son aksha together with many demons
when mandodaris son an expert in war had risen up to the sky i caught his feet and whirled him round a hundred times and smashed him
when aksha was done to death the tenfaced ravana was enraged and gave instruction to the second son called indrajit who was thirsting for war
when the army and even the generals were done to death in combat i was very happy
thinking that indrajit will surely kill me the strongarmed mighty ravana again sent intoxicated demon warriors
realising that i cannot be slain and that his indrajits power is reduced he released brahmas weapon on me with high speed and captured me
then the demons bound me with ropes and brought me to ravana
the wickedminded ravana then enquired me why i came to lanka and why i killed the demons
i have done all this for the sake of sita o demon king i came to your mansion desiring to see sita i am the legitimate son of windgod my name is hanuman
i am a vanara a messenger of rama and minister of sugrivayou may know that i have come here to convey the message of rama to you
highly powerful sugriva enquires your welfare he sends beneficial advice to you for your righteousness pleasures and wellbeing
while i was dwelling at the woodedmountain in rshyamuka a treaty of friendship was made with rama who is skilled in war
the king said my wife was abducted by a demon i request your help by all means to get her
sugriva told the story of vali in turn and asked for his help and to make agreement to kill vali
with fire as witness the great lord rama along with lakshmana made friendship with sugriva whose kingdom had been usurped
in the combat rama killed vali with a single arrow and made sugriva the king of vanaras
we too have to help him in this task so a message is sent to you on righteous grounds
before the heroic vanaras exterminate your entire army return sita at once to rama
who knows not the power of vanaras in the past even gods had sought their help
this i was asked to tell you by the king of vanaras wishing your welfare ravana then angrily looked at me as if to burn me
the evilminded demon ravana who perpetrates dreadful acts ordered my slaughter not knowing my power
vibhisana a very pious brother of the demon king interceded on my behalf
vibhishana a tiger among demons asked ravana to give up his decision as it was a forbidden course according to the science of royal polity
the royal code prohibits the murder of an emissary a wellwishing emissary should convey the truth
o ravana of immeasurable courage even if the emissary has done any kind of harm he may be mutilated but not murdered nowhere do the sastras allow killing of an ambassador
on hearing vibhishana ravana instructed the demons to burn my tail
having heard the kings words all the demons collected and held my tail wrapped it with saris of fibres and tattered rags of cotton
many ferociously courageous demons got ready they bound me and hit me with firesticks and fists they fastened my tail with ropes and set in on fire
the brave demons took me round the city through the royal streets and announced loudly to let every one know that i am bound and that my tail has been set on fire
i reduced my form and rid of the bondage then again i assumed my original huge form and took up an iron bar lying near and killed all the demons present
then i leaped to the entrance gate of the city without being perplexed with my burning tail i set fire to the boundaries and towering mansions which looked like the world at the end of dissolution
lanka has been burnt by me and sita might have also been burnt there is no doubt the great purpose of rama has been spoilt by me
thus i was overtaken by sorrow and worry just then i heard the wonderful propitious utterances of charanas announcing that sita was not burnt
it was amazing to hear the words of the charanas on hearing that jankai had not been burnt i understood that it is on her account that he is also not burnt although his tail was ignited
my tail was burning but i was not burnt by fire there was joy in my heart the wind carried sweet fragrance
for these two auspicious signs and the highly propitious words uttered by the sages i felt glad at heart
passing along the path of the windgod the moon the sun the siddhas and the gandharvas i came to see you
everything was favourable to me by the power of rama by your goodwill and for the great purpose of sugriva
let all that could not be done there and still remains to be done be accomplished by you i have presented the entire thing     thus ends the fiftyeighth sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
hanuman son of the windgod having narrated in detail all that had happened again started disclosing further details
it is due to ramas exertions sugrivas endeavour and sitas conduct that i have been successful my devotion to sita has further deepened
ravana is a great soul because even though he has done harm to her he is not killed this is so because sita being a chaste woman of good conduct and deep devotion towards her husband she refrained from killing ravana as she wanted her husband to do that
sita can burn ravana with the mere touch of her body but because of the power of his penance he was not burnt even though he touched her hand if enraged janaki can burn the whole world by virtue of her chastity in a way that even the flame of fire can not do but she desired that her husband should kill him
when strong wise and accomplished persons are there with me desiring victory why speak again
i can also kill all the army his followers sons and brothers of ravana in war
even if the missiles used by indrajit are brahmastra indrastra rudrastra vayavastra varunastra which are difficult to see i will destroy them in war and kill them
now if i am permitted i shall repulse them and destroy them with my valour a ceaseless shower of rocks sent forth by me in war is enough to destroy even gods what to say about the nightrangers
the ocean may exceed its limits the mountain mandara may be shaken from its position but no hostile army can move jambavan in war
even the mountain mandara would be shattered by great panasa or nila by the speed of their thighs what to say in a battle against ogres
who among gods yakshas gandharvas nagas and birds can contend mainda or dvivida in battletell me
the two sons of aswini are outstanding and foremost fighters and proud of waging war who can oppose them i do not see any one
by virtue of the boons received from brahma they are very proud they have also consumed nectar of immortality and are foremost among vanaras
earlier brahma the grandsire of all worlds has given the aswini sons immeasurable invulnerability to honour them
the heroic monkeys proud of their boons became intoxicated it and slaughtered vast army and drank the nectar of immortality
if these two become angry they have the power to destroy lanka the cavalry chariots and also the elephants even if the vanaras stay away
i have burnt lanka and have made my name popular even on the highways
mighty rama and lakshmana and king sugriva protected by rama are renowned for their valour i am hanuman son of the windgod a servant of rama this i announced
in the wicked ravanas ashoka garden under the simsupa tree the noble lady sita surrounded by ogresses is sitting tormented by tears her brightness is like the moons veiled by flakes of clouds she does not care for ravanas glory she is brooding over rama only
chaste sita of beautiful hips an auspicious lady though bound is wholly devoted to rama alone like sachi the wife of indra who was bound by nahusha
wearing the same single cloth which she had worn before filled with dust sita remained sorrowful and piteous wishing her husbands welfare
i saw sita often threatened by uglylooking ogresses wearing a single braid she looked pathetic thinking always about her husband lying on the bare ground she was like a lustreless lotus in winter spurning the advances by ravana she is rather determined to commit suicide
i created a little confidence in the fawneyed lady by pacifying her and explaining her with great difficulty the alliance of rama and sugriva on hearing which she became happy
to rama killing ravana is easy since ravanas power of penance has already declined by his abduction of sita separated from her husband she is naturally emaciated she has become slender just like a student on the new moon day on the first day of study
noble sita is absorbed in grief let us do all that has to be done now     thus ends the fiftyninth sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
after hearing hanuman valis son said o vanaras hanuman having seen sita it is not proper on our part to go without sita to the great soul rama
o vanaras you are known for your valour i think to tell rama that we have seen sita but not brought her is not proper
o noble vanaras indeed either among gods or among demons there is none who can match the vanaras in leaping and exhibiting valour
hence having killed the heroes among ogres what other task has hanuman to do let us get sita
jambavan the noble vanara skilled in the execution of tasks thus commanded in a determined manner
o prince what you think is acceptable to us also even though we are capable of achieving knowing what is in ramas mind we should act only according to his command to accomplish the task     thus ends the sixtieth sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramyana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
in the midst of all the leaders of the monkeys including angada hanuman accepted jambavans advice
thereafter led by hanuman all the vanaras left mahendra mountain and marched very happily the vanaras were strong and huge like elephants and resembled mountain meru moreover when they leaped up they seemed to cover the sky so it was difficult to tell their numbers since hanuman had accomplished the task the vanaras were praising his strength his swiftness and courage they were looking at hanuman without blinking their eyes and seemed as though they were carrying him by their eyes they were determined in their minds to please rama remaining in a state of offering themselves some of them more accomplished than others collected together eager to wage war and talking pleasantly among themselves having resolved to assist rama
the monkeys leaped into the sky and entered the garden that resembled the garden of indra filled with trees and creepers
the madhuvanam of sugriva was wellprotected and was difficult to access for the vanaras it was enchating to all beings
dadhimukha the foremost of all monkeys of great valour and the maternal uncle of sugriva was the caretaker of the garden
on reaching the vanara kings extensive delightful garden all the vanaras highly rejoiced
the honeycoloured monkeys felt happy on seeing the madhuvanam and sought angadas permission to drink honey
young angada asked old jambavans permission for the vanaras to drink honey and jambavan permitted them
permitted thus to drink honey the forestdwelling monkeys were motivated they rejoiced very happily and started dancing
some sang some prostrated on the ground some danced while some laughed some jumped from the tree some roamed about and some jumped up and down
while some supported one another some held each other some exchanged secrets with one another some entertained one another
while some ran from one tree to another some jumped down from broken branches and some swiftfooted ones fell down from the top of trees
while one was singing others approached him laughing while some were laughing others fell on them laughing excessively while some were roaring others went pushing them down while some were encouraged to do something others shouted at them
the army of monkeys had lost control over their bodies due to drinking of honeywine not even one was quietly seated there not even one was not intoxicated not only that none were satisfied
beholding the destruction wrought by the vanaras to the garden trees leaves and flowers and having drunk all the honey dadhimukha angrily asked them to stop and get out
the elderly dadhimukha who was the powerful protector of the garden reprimanded them and devised yet again a plan to protect it
he spoke harshly to some to others he asked not to talk some he slapped on the hind part with the palm of his hand to some he spoke pleasantly and with some he quarrelled and to others he spoke in a conciliatory manner
in their drunkenness they were using abusive language and with their strength they retaliated without fear they invaded without considering their mistakes they caught hold of dadhimukha and pulled him
in their drunkenness some monkeys scratched dadhimukha violently with their nails some bit him with their teeth and others slapped and kicked him with their palms and legsgetting together they looted the garden completely      thus ends the sixtyfirst sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
hanuman the foremost of the monkeys bull among vanaras said enjoy the honey devoid of any fear i shall prevent those who object to your action
pleased with hanumans words the distinguished angada permitted the monkeys to drink
even if hanuman the achiever forbids me to do something i will do it and now when he has permitted you why hesitate
having heard the words that came from angadas mouth the bulls among vanaras praised him for his generous approval
the vanaras praised angada the bull among vanaras and went to madhuvanam swiftly like a fastflowing river going to uproot a tree
overjoyed at the news of mythili being seen the vanaras entered madhuvanam and attacked the guards violently drank the honey and ate the tasty fruits
all the vanaras collected together entered the madhuvanam and attacked in many ways the guards protecting the garden
all of them now gathered at one place and drank honey from large containers others were busy preventing the guards
the honeycoloured monkeys drank honey some threw large chunks of honey combs after drinking and some went about intoxicated
some took branches of trees and rested at the root of trees some totally languid lay down spreading leaves due to drinking of sweet drinks
intoxicated with drink some behaved like mad people some pushed others senselessly and some were unsteady and shaky
some roared some warbled happily some felt drowsy drinking honey and some dropped off to sleep on the ground
some made others laugh some provoked others and some thought of doing something else having got over the intoxication
all the guards engaged in protecting the garden were driven away in all directions by the fierce vanaras
some were dragged on their knees and tossed up some monkeys exhibited their private parts showing indecent behaviour dadhimukha highly disturbed at this said
permitted by hanuman to enter madhuvanam and drink they dragged one another forcefully tossed up on their knees showing their private parts
then dadhimukha the guardian of the garden became furious on the vanaras having heard from the guards that the garden was destroyed he said soothing words to them
come we will all go there to madhuvanam and prevent forcibly the vanaras who have consumed honey proud of their power
the heroes bulls among vanaras heard dadhimukha and quickly entered madhuvanam along with him
on the way the energetic dadhimukha took up a tree and ran to the leaping vanaras swiftly with guards following him
the furious vanara guards lifted rocks trees and even mountains and went behind dadhimukha the elephant among the vanaras
the heroic vanaras held sala and tala trees and rushed at once keeping their leaders words in mind
then the heroic guards in their thousands fell on the vanaras proud of their power on and under the tala trees
having seen the fury of dadhimukha hanuman the leader of the vanaras went to him swiftly
seeing the revered powerful and strongarmed dadhimukha rushing to him the angry angada caught him with both hands tightly
blinded by arrogance the prince pushed him dadhimukha on the floor forcibly forgetting that he was his revered granduncle
the heroic dadhimukha an elephant among monkeys with his shoulders and arms broken and body drenched in blood lost his consciousness instantly
at once dadhimukha the maternal uncle of the king became conscious and chased with a stick the intoxicated vanaras
escaping from the vanaras with great difficulty dadhimukha a bull among monkeys repaired to a secluded place and said to his servants
let them stay here our broadnecked king sugriva will be there with rama let us go to him
madhuvan has come down to us from our forefathers time dear to the king its entry is prohibited even to the gods
sugriva will chase all the vanaras and their friends greedy for honey they will be punished with a stick they are doomed
indeed those evilminded ones who have disobeyed the kings order deserve to be killedthat way our fury and forbearance will result in success
powerful dadhimukha having said that to the guardians of the garden rose up to the sky and went off with them
in a moment dadhimukha reached the place where wise sugriva the son of sungod was there
seeing rama lakshmana and also sugriva from the sky he landed on an even ground
dadhimukha a great hero and king of the guards protecting madhuvanam surrounded by his servants with a sad expression on his face offered painful obeisance with folded hands bowing down his forehead at the feet of sugriva      thus ends the sixtysecond sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
feeling anxious on seeing dadhimukha touching his feet with his forehead sugriva the bull among vanaras said
o heroic dadhimukha get up tell me why you have fallen at my feet i give you protection from all
when great sugriva gave assurance to wise dadhimukha he got up and said
o king in your time or even before during the time of vali that madhuvanam was forbidden for entry now it has been laid waste by the trespassing vanaras
even though the garden guards forcibly tried to prevent them they did not care and have devoured all the honey
some have thrown off the leftovers when others were prevented from drinking off the honey they raised their eyebrows to show their grouch
when the guards asked the vanaras to leave the garden the enraged vanaras misbehaved with them
o sugriva the vanara guards were chased away by the many heroic monkeys angry and redeyed
some were struck with hands some beaten on their knees and were dragged as they liked and showed up their private parts
these heroes struck that way devoured the madhuvanam on the earth at their will and devoured the honey even when you are there as king
while dadhimukha appealed thus to wise sugriva lakshmana the killer of enemies happened to see them and enquired
o king why has this protector of the garden come here why is he sad what is he narrating asked lakshmana
great prince lakshmana thus said sugriva the proficient speaker replied
o venerable lakshmana dadhimukha as complaining that the fruits and honey have been consumed by the vanara heroes angada and others who have come after their search for sita in the southern direction
those vanaras having entered madhuvanam and broken the trees are quite right had they not accomplished their purpose they would not have indulged themselves that way
if they have trespassed into the garden that way they might have done their duty no doubt hanuman alone among them might have seen sita
hanuman alone has the ability to do it the reason being he has the capacity the wisdom streneous effort virility and enthusiasm to accomplish it these attributes are wellestablished in him
where jambavan angada and hanuman are leaders directing the task of the army it must have been accomplished
here is dadhimukha a vanara known for his valour and sweet tongue he came here this incident to tell
o strongarmed saumitri the vanaras must have seen sita or else they would not have arrived to drink honey
if the renowned vanaras had not seen vaidehi they would not have entered the wonderful garden granted as boon by brahma
then righteous rama and lakshmana rejoiced to hear the words of sugriva which were pleasing to the ears
beautifulnecked sugriva heard dadhimukha the protector of the garden felt very glad and replied
they went to the garden to drink only after having performed their duty i am glad about it since they have accomplished the purpose they are to be excused for their behaviour i have pardoned them
beholding young rama and lakshmana extremely delighted their eyes filled with joy out of fulfilment of the purpose sugriva who was also highly delighted felt an auspicious thrill on his limbs and knew that good time had come     thus ends the sixtythird sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
pleased with sugrivas command to send forth angada and hanuman dadhimukha offered salutations to sugriva rama and lakshmana
dadhimukha offered his obeisance to sugriva and the mighty rama and lakshmana and rose up to the sky followed by the vanaras
descending into madhuvanam dadhimukha saw all the monkey troops free from intoxication of honeywine
heroic dadhimukha went to angada holding his cupped palms reverentially and spoke these conciliatory words with joy
o handsome one do not react harshly at these guards who have obstructed your companions out of ignorance and fury
o mighty angada you are heir apparent and also king out of foolishness i obstructed you you ought to pardon me this mistake
o blameless prince i have already told your fathers elder brother and all the forestdwellers about your arrival here
he was not angry at your destruction of the garden on the other hand he was very glad to hear about your arrival
your fathers brother sugriva the lord of vanaras felt very glad and indeed asked me to send you quickly
at these good words from dadhimukha angada the monkey leader an eloquent speaker said this
o scorcher of enemies i presume rama has already heard the news of our arrival on accomplishment of the task hence it is not proper for us to tarry here
the vanaras of the forest have taken rest after drinking as much honey as they desired what is left here to do we have to go wherever sugriva is
angada said to the vanara troops assembled tell me what we have to do i shall act as you wish
even though i am heir apparent it is not proper for me to order youyou have accomplished the purpose and to command you is not befitting on my part
on hearing angadas valuable words said in that way the vanaras repled
o king o bull among monkeys we think you are an exception to those to whom prosperity brings arrogance
you alone could speak such words your humility speaks of your fitness for a bright future
o angada the best of vanaras without your command none will find it possible to put forward even a single step
thus addressed by all the vanaras angada said well let us go then the powerful vanaras rose up the sky
all the vanara troops sprang up into the air as though there was no sky like stones shattered by machines from the mountains rise up
the swift monkeys roared aloud as though they went up the sky like thundering clouds driven by the wind
seeing the griefstricken lotuseyed rama the lord of the vanaras sugriva said this before the arrival of angada
trust me rama be blessed the vanaras have seen the divine lady there is no doubt it is not possible for them to come here after exceeding the time limit in their search for sita
my heir apparent the strongarmed angada and the best of the monkeys is endowed with virtues he would not come near me if his mission had failed
in case the vanaras have returned without accomplishing the task angada would have assumed a pathetic face perplexed and unsteady in mind
if angada lord of the vanaras had not been happy he would not have destroyed the madhuvanam of my fathers and my grandfathers time o rama follower of righteous practices kausalya has an excellent son in you trust me
hanuman is the one who has accomplished this task who else can no doubt he has seen sita
o rama the best among the wise just like the luminosity that abides in the sun capacity to succeed energy intelligence even courage and steadfastness reside in hanuman
where jambavan is the leader angada the commander of the army and hanuman the guiding force the end result will not be otherwise
you are extremely valiant and it is unbecoming of you to be anxious at this time rama just then chatterings of the monkeys were heard from the sky as they roared in pride talking of hanumans achievement having successfully completed the errand they have arrived at kishkinda
the great sugriva heard the roar of the monkeys and was extremely happy he kept raising and shaking his long tail in joy
the joyful monkeys with angada and hanuman leading them descended with eagerness to have a close look at rama
angada the chief along with the heroic monkeys very joyfully and exuberantly descended close to sugriva the king of monkeys and rama
then the strongarmed hanuman with his head bowed down offered salutations and reported divine lady sita with her constant devotion to sri rama is sound in body
on hearing the nectarlike words from hanuman that sita was found rama and lakshmana were delighted
sugriva and lakshmana glanced at hanuman respectfully with affection thinking surely hanuman alone has succeeded
thereafter the vanaras arrived at the prasrvana mount with wonderful forests and bowed down to sri rama and mighty lakshaman and sugriva placing their leader heir apparent in front then they began telling the story of sita and her state
the monkeys in ramas presence narrated all about sitas detention in ravanas ashoka garden the ogresses threatening her and the time limit fixed by ravana for her survival
hearing of sita alive and not harmed rama asked the vanaras how is sita how is she disposed to me tell me everything
on hearing the words from rama the vanaras requested hanuman who was aware of sitas position to tell rama all about her
the son of the wind god hanuman who was wise in speech heard the words of rama offered salutations to sita in the direction in which she was located and narrated the story about her discovery
having crossed the sea consisting of a hundred yojanas in quest of vaidehi i found her
on the southern shore of the ocean is situated the city of lanka ruled by the evilminded ravana
there in the inner palace of ravana i saw your lovely wife sita with all her hopes pinned on you giving up all other desires
i found her in the beautiful garden guarded by hideous ogresses threatening her again and again
sita who did not deserve and yet was full of grief was detained by ravana in his inner palace guarded by ogresses she had single braid a sign of desolation was pathetic and totally absorbed in your thought she was lying on bare ground with her limbs turned pale like lotus in winter she was averse to ravana and was determined to commit suicide she has only rama in her mind somehow i found her
o sinless one o tiger among men to inspire confidence in her i praised the glory of your ikshvaku dynasty
when the divine lady talked to me i presented all the facts about the alliance of rama and sugriva on hearing me virtuous sita whose devotion is fixed on you became delighted
o bull among men i saw janakithe delight of janaka a formidable lady filled with devotion to you and richly endowed with austerity
o wise one with your ring given her she told me an anecdote of a crow that took place at chitrakuta
she saido son of the windgod you should let rama the tiger among men know all that you have seen here
within hearing of sugriva tell him about your efforts present thissignet to rama carefully preserved by me
this auspicious jewel chudamani has been preserved by me very carefully remind him of the decorative red mark he painted with a stone pigment on my forehead indeed it is proper to remind him of this
o sinless one tell rama that this auspicious chudamani born in the ocean is sent to him and i was gazing at it as if it was him rama and feeling happy
o son of dasaratha i will hold on to life for a month captured by the demons i will not live for more than a month
with her limbs emaciated through austerities detained in ravanas inner palace eyes wide open in fear sita said this to me
o rama i have spoken everything that has happened we have to pay attention to the means of crossing the ocean
coming to know that the two princes were sighing in relief hanuman presented the token of identification given by sita to rama after having communicated in full the messsage of sita in an orderly manner     thus ends the sixtyfifth sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
thus addressed by hanuman rama held the token chudamani against his bosom and wept with lakshmana
seeing the precious jewel ramas eyes were filled with tears overwhelmed with grief he spoke to sugriva
just as a cow fond of its calf begins to distil milk from its teats at the sight of the calf so does my heart melt at the sight of this excellent jewel
this was found in water and was bestowed by indra out of great joy on janaka who had performed a grand sacrificial ceremony so it was worshipped by elders of the family
o noble sugriva now when i see this excellent jewel i get direct sight of my father and king of videha in the same way as i obtained the sight of sita
this jewel was shining on the head of my beloved now its mere look makes me feel that i am seeing her
o handsome hanuman sita is like water for a thirsty person tell me again and again what sita said to you sprinkle on me lifegiving water of her words in the form of message
o saumitri i see this jewel born formed under water but not her what can be more sorrowful to me
take me to the place you saw my beloved knowing where she is i cannot stay here even for a moment
she is always very timid how can my fairhipped beloved remain in the midst of dreadful and fearsome demons
her face resembling the autumnal moon bereft of its stain though covered with rainclouds does not shine so bright
o hanuman tell me now truly what has been told by her i am eager to know indeed it will keep me alive just as medicne does i shall survive on the strength of her message
that lovely sita who speaks sweetly that fairhipped beautiful one who has been separated from me my beloved what did she say please narrate     thus ends the sixtysixth sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
thus asked by sri rama hanuman repeated everything spoken by sita to rama
o bull among men queen janaki related to me as a token of identification an incident that had taken place at chitrakuta in the past
when she was lying on your lap happily she awoke early and a crow came swiftly and scratched on her breast
o bharatas brother when sita awoke from sleep you slept on her lap the same crow again hurt her
o scorcher of enemies pained by the crow hurting her repeatedly while you were sleeping happily she woke you up and informed you about it
seeing the blood flowing from her breasts you became furious like a hissing serpent and said
you are of timid nature who has scratched your breasts with the tip of the nail who is sporting with an enraged fivehooded serpent
seeing all over at once i glanced at the crow that stood in front of her with sharp bloodstained nails
that crow the foremost of the birds was the son of indra moving about all over the earth swiftly his speed matched the windgods
o longarmed wise and revered rama then in anguish you took a cruel decision
you took out a blade of grass from your mat and chanted the mantra to invoke the weapon of brahma brahmastra and hurled it on the crow it blazed like the fire of the dooms day
you hurled the blazing blade of grass on to the crow that burning blade of grass chased the crow
he was abandoned by his father even by great sages and gods then he went round the three worlds but could not find a saviour
o destroyer of enemies the crow came back again to you trembling seeking protection from you and fell on the ground even though it deserved to be slayed you saved him out of compassion
o rama since a divine weapon cannot be withdrawn it did strike his right eye
thereafter that crow left without killing offered salutations to you and king dasaratha and returned to his abode
you are efficient foremost among wielders of weapons truthful and powerful why are you not directing weapons against the demons
it is not possible for nagas gandharvas even asuras or marutas to confront rama in war
if you have any anxiety about me you will certainly slay ravana in the battle immediately with your sharp arrows
for what reason is the the scorcher of enemies lakshmana the best of men also does not protect me at the behest of rama his brother
why are the two tigers among men whose power is like that of wind and fire and who are unassailable even to suras are neglecting me
have i done any great sin because of which even though both the scorchers of enemies are capable they are not doing so
on hearing vaidehis piteous words i once again said this to the noble lady
o divine lady i swear to you on my truthfulness that out of grief for you rama is not interested in anything else and lakshmana is deeply afflicted because rama is overhelmed with grief
o lovely lady somehow i could discover you this is not the moment for lamentationyour grief will end
the two princes tigers among men are blameles they are anxious to see you they will reduce this lanka into ashes
o fairhipped lady rama will slay fearsome ravana and all his relatives and take you to his city it is certain
o blameless lady you should give me that which he would be glad to recognise as a token
o mighty rama she glanced at all directions and untied the end of her garment in which she had this best jewel worn on her hair preserved and gave it to me
o foremost among the raghus i took that wonderful gem for your sake from the noble lady and offered her salutations bowing my head and returned quickly
seeing me eager to depart and growing in size the loving daughter of janaka said
she was dejected her face was filled with tears despondent at my departure she shed tears profusely and said
hanuman tell both rama and lakshman who are like two lions sugriva and his ministers about my welfare
you may go and tell mighty rama to make arrangements to relieve me from this ocean of sorrow
o foremost among the heroic monkeys approaching rama you should tell him the intensity of my sorrow and the threatening of the shedemons let your journey be speedy and auspicious
o lion among kings noble sita has spoken these words in grief make him know all this and tell him that sita is faithful and safe in all respects     thus ends the sixtyseventh sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki
o tiger among men in view of her regards for me and and her love for you she was confident and once again addressed me
you may appeal to rama the son of dasaratha in many ways that he should come quickly and slay ravana in the battle and get me back
o crusher of enemies o brave hanuman i wish you rest for a while in a secluded place around here and leave tomorrow
o valiant hanuman by your presence here the less fortunate me will be relieved of sorrow for a while
o courageous tiger among monkeys when you depart abruptly i doubt if i would be alive by your return
i am an unfortunate one afflicted by sorrow and tormented by demons if i am not able to see you i will be lamenting in grief
o brave vanaras i have great doubts about your assistants the vanaras and bears crossing the ocean
how will the vanaras and bears cross this great impassable ocean how will the princes rama and lakshmna be able to cross it
only three among all beings garuda the windgod and you have the capacity to cross the ocean
o heroic hanuman you know how to succeed but i wish to know what expedient you have to accomplish which is difficult by all means o foremost vanara please tell me
o slayer of enemy heroes you have the ability to accomplsh this task singlehanded by succeeding in accomplishing the objective you will become renowned and not rama
when rama slays ravana and his entire army and takes me to his city after becoming victorious it will add glory to him
tell valiant rama not to take me back the way ravana the demon abducted me out of fear which is not right
if rama the slayer of the enemy army could fill lanka with his arrows and take me that will be a good sight for him to see
you may make arrangement in such a way that the exalted hero rama exhibits his might according to his stature
hearing the meaningful courteous and reasonable words of sita i replied
o queen the lord of the army of bears and vanaras who is the foremost among the monkeys is endowed with enough strength and has resolved to rescue you
mighty powerful and tough monkeys who have the speed of thought are under the command of sugriva
o great lady the mighty vanaras of extraordinary strength can fly with the wind and have even circumambulated the earth
there are monkeys who are more powerful than me or equal to me none are less strong than me or sugriva
when i could come here what to speak of the mightier monkeys people do not send the superior ones on errand but send only the juniors
o noble lady give up your lamentation enough of sorrowing the vanara army will fly and reach this place at one leap and fill it
o noble lady the lions among men rama and lakshmana who resemble sun and moon will ascend on my back and reach here
you will see the lionlike rama a slayer of enemies and lakshmana wielding bow in hand standing at the entrance of lanka very soon
you will hear before long the shouts of generals of the vanaras who resemble rainclouds on the mountain roaring like lions from the malaya mountain of lanka
you will soon see rama the slayer of enemies crowned as king of ayodhya with you having duly completed the term of exile in the forest
sita though afflicted heard from me that you were also in excessive grief on account of separation from her and from my soothing auspicious and welcome words she derived comfort and remained quiet     thus ends the sixtyeighth sarga of sundarakanda of the holy ramayana the first epic composed by sage valmiki

vouchsafe us shelter broad and sure
the gods be gracious unto us even from the place whence visnu strode
through the seven regions of the earth
through all this world strode visnu thrice his foot he planted and the whole
was gathered in his footsteps dust
visnu the guardian he whom none deceiveth made three steps thenceforth
establishing his high decrees
look ye on visnus works whereby the friend of indra closeallied
hath let his holy ways be seen
the princes evermore behold that loftiest place where visnu is
laid as it were an eye in heaven

lovers of holy song light up

drink vayu the presented draughts
both deities who touch the heaven indra and vayu we invoke
to drink of this our soma juice
the singers for their aid invoke indra and vayu swift as mind
the thousandeyed the lords of thought
mitra and varuna renowned as gods of consecrated might
we call to drink the soma juice
those who by law uphold the law lords of the shining light of law
mitra i call and varuna
let varuna be our chief defence let mitra guard us with all aids
both make us rich exceedingly
indra by maruts girt we call to drink the soma juice may he
sate him in union with his troop
gods marut hosts whom indra leads distributers of pusans gifts
hearken ye all unto my cry
with conquering indra for ally strike vrtra down ye bounteous gods
let not the wicked master us
we call the universal gods and maruts to the soma draught
for passing strong are prsnis sons
fierce comes the maruts thundering voice like that of conquerors when ye go
forward to victory o men
born of the laughing lightning may the maruts guard us everywhere
may they be gracious unto us
like some lost animal drive to us bright pusan him who bears up heaven
resting on manycoloured grass
pusan the bright has found the king concealed and hidden in a cave
who rests on grass of many hues
and may he duly bring to me the six bound closely through these drops
as one who ploughs with steers brings corn
along their paths the mothers go sisters of priestly ministrants
mingling their sweetness with the milk
may waters gathered near the sun and those wherewith the sun is joined
speed forth this sacrifice of ours
i call the waters goddesses wherein our cattle quench their thirst
oblations to the streams be given
amrit is in the waters in the waters there is healing balm
be swift ye gods to give them praise
within the waterssoma thus hath told medwell all balms that heal
and agni he who blesseth all the waters hold all medicines
o waters teem with medicine to keep my body safe from harm
so that i long may see the sun
whatever sin is found in me whatever evil i have wrought
if i have lied or falsely sworn waters remove it far from me
the waters i this day have sought and to their moisture have we come
o agni rich in milk come thou and with thy splendour cover me
fill me with splendour agni give offspring and length of days the gods
shall know me even as i am and indra with the rsis know
who now is he what god among immortals of whose auspicious name we may bethink us
who shall to mighty aditi restore us that i may see my father and my mother
agni the god the first among the immortalsof his auspicious name let us bethink us
he shall to mighty aditi restore us that i may see my father and my mother
to thee o savitar the lord of precious things who helpest us
continually for our share we come
wealth highly lauded ere reproach hath fallen on it which is laid
free from all hatred in thy hands
through thy protection may we come to even the height of affluence
which bhaga hath dealt out to us
neer have those birds that fly through air attained to thy high dominion or thy might or spirit
nor these the waters that flow on for ever nor hills abaters of the winds wild fury
varuna king of hallowed might sustaineth erect the trees stem in the baseless region
its rays whose root is high above stream downward deep may they sink within us and be hidden
king varuna hath made a spacious pathway a pathway for the sun wherein to travel
where no way was he made him set his footstep and warned afar whateer afflicts the spirit
a hundred balms are thine o king a thousand deep and widereaching also be thy favours
far from us far away drive thou destruction put from us een the sin we have committed
whither by day depart the constellations that shine at night set high in heaven above us
varunas holy laws remain unweakened and through the night the moon moves on in splendor
i ask this of thee with my prayer adoring thy worshipper craves this with his oblation
varuna stay thou here and be not angry steal not our life from us o thou wideruler
nightly and daily this one thing they tell me this too the thought of mine own heart repeateth
may he to whom prayed fettered sunahsepa may he the sovran varuna release us
bound to three pillars captured sunahsepa thus to the aditya made his supplication
him may the sovran varuna deliver wise neer deceived loosen the bonds that bind him
with bending down oblations sacrifices o varuna we deprecate thine anger
wise asura thou king of wide dominion loosen the bonds of sins by us committed
loosen the bonds o varuna that hold me loosen the bonds above between and under
so in thy holy law may we made sinless belong to aditi o thou aditya
whatever law of thine o god o varuna as we are men
day after day we violate
give us not as a prey to death to be destroyed by thee in wrath
to thy fierce anger when displeased
to gain thy mercy varuna with hymns we bind thy heart as binds
the charioteer his tethered horse
they flee from me dispirited bent only on obtaining wealth
as to their nests the birds of air
when shall we bring to be appeased the hero lord of warrior might
him the farseeing varuna
this this with joy they both accept in common never do they fail
the everfaithful worshipper
he knows the path of birds that fly through heaven and sovran of the sea
he knows the ships that are thereon
true to his holy law he knows the twelve moons with their progeny
he knows the moon of later birth
he knows the pathway of the wind the spreading high and mighty wind
he knows the gods who dwell above
varuna true to holy law sits down among his people he
most wise sits there to govern all
from thence perceiving he beholds all wondrous things both what hath been
and what hereafter will be done
may that aditya very wise make fair paths for us all our days
may he prolong our lives for us
varuna wearing golden mail hath clad him in a shining robe
his spies are seated found about
the god whom enemies threaten not nor those who tyrannize oer men
nor those whose minds are bent on wrong
he who gives glory to mankind not glory that is incomplete
to our own bodies giving it
yearning for the wideseeing one my thoughts move onward unto him
as kine unto their pastures move
once more together let us speak because my meath is brought priestlike
thou eatest what is dear to thee
now saw i him whom all may see i saw his car above the earth
he hath accepted these my songs
varuna hear this call of mine be gracious unto us this day
longing for help i cried to thee
thou o wise god art lord of all thou art the king of earth and heaven
hear as thou goest on thy way
release us from the upper bond untie the bond between and loose
the bonds below that i may live
o worthy of oblation lord of prospering powers assume thy robes
and offer this our sacrifice
sit ever to be chosen as our priest most youthful through our hymns
o agni through our heavenly word
for here a father for his son kinsman for kinsman worshippeth
and friend choiceworthy for his friend
here let the foedestroyers sit varuna mitra aryaman
like men upon our sacred grass
o ancient herald be thou glad in this our rite and fellowship
hearken thou well to these our songs
whateer in this perpetual course we sacrifice to god and god
that gift is offered up in thee
may he be our dear household lord priest pleasant and choiceworthy may
we with bright fires be dear to him
the gods adored with brilliant fires have granted precious wealth to us
so with bright fires we pray to thee
and o immortal one so may the eulogies of mortal men
belong to us and thee alike
with all thy fires o agni find pleasure in this our sacrifice
and this our speech o son of strength

i will declare the manly deeds of indra the first that he achieved the thunderwielder
he slew the dragon then disclosed the waters and cleft the channels of the mountain torrents
he slew the dragon lying on the mountain his heavenly bolt of thunder tvastar fashioned
like lowing kine in rapid flow descending the waters glided downward to the ocean
impetuous as a bull he chose the soma and in three sacred beakers drank the juices
maghavan grasped the thunder for his weapon and smote to death this firstborn of the dragons
when indra thou hadst slain the dragons firstborn and overcome the charms of the enchanters
then giving life to sun and dawn and heaven thou foundest not one foe to stand against thee
indra with his own great and deadly thunder smote into pieces vrtra worst of vrtras
as trunks of trees what time the axe hath felled them low on the earth so lies the prostrate dragon
he like a mad weak warrior challenged indra the great impetuous manyslaying hero
he brooking not the clashing of the weapons crushedindras foethe shattered forts in falling
footless and handless still he challenged indra who smote him with his bolt between the shoulders
emasculate yet claiming manly vigour thus vrtra lay with scattered limbs dissevered
there as he lies like a bankbursting river the waters taking courage flow above him
the dragon lies beneath the feet of torrents which vrtra with his greatness had encompassed
then humbled was the strength of vrtras mother indra hath cast his deadly bolt against her
the mother was above the son was under and like a cow beside her calf lay danu
rolled in the midst of neverceasing currents flowing without a rest for ever onward
the waters bear off vrtras nameless body the foe of indra sank to during darkness
guarded by ahi stood the thralls of dasas the waters stayed like kine held by the robber
but he when he had smitten vrtra opened the cave wherein the floods had been imprisoned
a horses tail wast thou when he o indra smote on thy bolt thou god without a second
thou hast won back the kine hast won the soma thou hast let loose to flow the seven rivers
nothing availed him lightning nothing thunder hailstorm or mist which had spread around him
when indra and the dragon strove in battle maghavan gained the victory for ever
whom sawest thou to avenge the dragon indra that fear possessed thy heart when thou hadst slain him
that like a hawk affrighted through the regions thou crossedst nineandninety flowing rivers
indra is king of all that moves and moves not of creatures tame and horned the thunderwielder
over all living men he rules as sovran containing all as spokes within the felly
come fain for booty let us seek to indra yet more shall he increase his care that guides us
will not the indestructible endow us with perfect knowledge of this wealth of cattle
i fly to him invisible wealthgiver as flies the falcon to his cherished eyrie
with fairest hymns of praise adoring indra whom those who laud him must invoke in battle
mid all his host he bindeth on the quiver he driveth cattle from what foe he pleaseth
gathering up great store of riches indra be thou no trafficker with us most mighty
thou slewest with thy bolt the wealthy dasyu alone yet going with thy helpers indra
far from the floor of heaven in all directions the ancient riteless ones fled to destruction
fighting with pious worshippers the riteless turned and fled indra with averted faces
when thou fierce lord of the bay steeds the stayer blewest from earth and heaven and sky the godless
they met in fight the army of the blameless then the navagvas put forth all their power
they like emasculates with men contending fled conscious by steep paths from indra scattered
whether they weep or laugh thou hast oerthrown them o indra on the skys extremest limit
the dasyu thou hast burned from heaven and welcomed the prayer of him who pours the juice and lauds thee
adorned with their array of gold and jewels they oer the earth a covering veil extended
although they hastened they oercame not indra their spies he compassed with the sun of morning
as thou enjoyest heaven and earth o indra on every side surrounded with thy greatness
so thou with priests hast blown away the dasyu and those who worship not with those who worship
they who pervaded earths extremest limit subdued not with their charms the wealthbestower
indra the bull made his ally the thunder and with its light milked cows from out the darkness
the waters flowed according to their nature he raid the navigable streams waxed mighty
then indra with his spirit concentrated smote him for ever with his strongest weapon
indra broke through ilibisas strong castles and susna with his horn he cut to pieces
thou maghavan for all his might and swiftness slewest thy fighting foeman with thy thunder
fierce on his enemies fell indras weapon with his sharp bull he rent their forts in pieces
he with his thunderbolt dealt blows on vrtra and conquered executing all his purpose
indra thou helpest kutsa whom thou lovedst and guardedst brave dasadyu when he battled
the dust of trampling horses rose to heaven and svitras son stood up again for conquest
svitras mild steer o maghavan thou helpest in combat for the land mid tugras houses
long stood they there before the task was ended thou wast the master of the foemens treasure

they gather glory on their way

who is your mightiest heroes when o shakers of the earth and heaven
ye shake them like a garments hem
at your approach man holds him down before the fury of your wrath

trembles in terror on their ways
strong is their birth vigour have they to issue from their mother strength
yea even twice enough is theirs
and these the sons the singers in their racings have enlarged the bounds
so that the kine must walk kneedeep
before them on the ways they go they drop this offspring of the cloud
long broad and inexhaustible
o maruts as your strength is great so have ye cast men down on earth
so have ye made the mountains fall
the while the maruts pass along they talk together on the way
doth any hear them as they speak
come quick with swift steeds for ye have worshippers among kanvas sons
may you rejoice among them well
all is prepared for your delight we are their servants evermore
to live as long as life may last
what now when will ye take us by both hands as a dear sire his son
gods for whom sacred grass is clipped
now whither to what goal of yours go ye in heaven and not on earth
where do your cows disport themselves
where are your newest favours shown where maruts your prosperity
where all your high felicities
if o ye maruts ye the sons whom prsni bore were mortal and
immortal he who sings your praise
then never were your praiser loathed like a wild beast in pastureland
nor should he go on yamas path
let not destructive plague on plague hard to be conquered strike its down
let each with drought depart from us

with the waterladen raincloud
o maruts at your voices sound this earthly habitation shakes
and each man reels who dwells therein
o maruts with your stronghoofed steeds unhindered in their courses haste

o son of strength each mortal calls to thee for aid when spoil of battle waits for him
o maruts may this man who loves you well obtain wealth of good steeds and hero might
may brahmanaspati draw nigh may sunrta the goddess come
and gods bring to this rite which gives the fivefold gift the hero lover of mankind
he who bestows a noble guerdon on the priest wins fame that never shall decay
for him we offer sacred herogiving food peerless and conquering easily
now brahmanaspati speaks forth aloud the solemn hymn of praise
wherein indra and varuna mitra aryaman the gods have made their dwelling place
may we in holy synods gods recite that hymn peerless that brings felicity
if you o heroes graciously accept this word may it obtain all bliss from you
who shall approach the pious who the man whose sacred grass is trimmed
the offerer with his folk advances more and more he fills his house with precious things
he amplifies his lordly might with kings he slays een mid alarms he dwells secure
in great or lesser fight none checks him none subduesthe wielder of the thunderbolt
neer is he injured whom the gods varuna mitra aryaman
the excellently wise protect
he prospers ever free from scathe whom they as with full hands enrich
whom they preserve from every foe
the kings drive far away from him his troubles and his enemies
and lead him safely oer distress
thornless adityas is the path easy for him who seeks the law
with him is naught to anger you
what sacrifice adityas ye heroes guide by the path direct
may that come nigh unto your thought
that mortal ever unsubdued gains wealth and every precious thing
and children also of his own

within his hand until they fall

usana kavya straightway hither drove the kine let us with offerings honour yamas deathless birth
when sacred grass is trimmed to aid the auspicious work or the hymn makes its voice of praise sound to the sky
where the stone rings as twere a singer skilled in laudindra in truth delights when these come near to him
they who are glancing forth like women on their way doers of mighty deeds swift racers rudras sons
the maruts have made heaven and earth increase and grow in sacrifices they delight the strong and wild
grown to their perfect strength greatness have they attained the rudras have established their abode in heaven
singing their song of praise and generating might they have put glory on the sons whom prsni bare
when children of the cow they shine in bright attire and on their fair limbs lay their golden ornaments
they drive away each adversary from their path and following their traces fatness floweth down
when mighty warriors ye who glitter with your spears oerthrowing with your strength een what is neer oerthrown
when o ye maruts ye the host that send the rain had harnessed to your cars the thoughtfleet spotted deer
when ye have harnessed to your cars the spotted deer urging the thunderbolt o maruts to the fray
forth rush the torrents of the dark red stormy cloud and moisten like a skin the earth with waterfloods
let your swiftgliding coursers bear you hitherward with their fleet pinions come ye forward with your arms
sit on the grass a wide seat hath been made for you delight yourselves o maruts in the pleasant food
strong in their native strength to greatness have they grown stepped to the firmament and made their dwelling wide
when visnu saved the soma bringing wild delight the maruts sate like birds on their dear holy grass
in sooth like heroes fain for fight they rush about like combatants fameseeking have they striven in war
before the maruts every creature is afraid the men are like to kings terrible to behold
when tvastar deft of hand had turned the thunderbolt golden with thousand edges fashioned more skilfully
indra received it to perform heroic deeds vrtra he slew and forced the flood of water forth
they with their vigorous strength pushed the well up on high and clove the cloud in twain though it was passing strong
the maruts bounteous givers sending forth their voice in the wild joy of soma wrought their glorious deeds
they drave the cloud transverse directed hitherward and poured the fountain forth for thirsting gotama
shining with varied light they come to him with help they with their might fulfilled the longing of the sage
the shelters which ye have for him who lauds you bestow them threefold on the man who offers
extend the same boons unto us ye maruts give us o heroes wealth with noble offspring

loud singers never humbled active full of strength immovable impetuous manliest bestbeloved
they have displayed themselves with glittering ornaments a few in number only like the heavens with stars
when maruts on the steeps ye pile the moving cloud ye are like birds on whatsoever path it be
clouds everywhere shed forth the rain upon your cars drop fatness honeyhued for him who sings your praise
earth at their racings trembles as if weak and worn when on their ways they yoke their cars for victory
they sportive loudly roaring armed with glittering spears shakers of all themselves admire their mightiness
selfmoving is that youthful band with spotted steeds thus it hath lordly sway endued with power and might
truthful art thou and blameless searcher out of sin so thou strong host wilt be protector of this prayer
we speak by our descent from our primeval sire our tongue when we behold the soma stirs itself
when shouting they had joined indra in toil of fight then only they obtained their sacrificial names
splendours they gained for glory they who wear bright rings rays they obtained and men to celebrate their praise
armed with their swords impetuous and fearing naught they have possessed the maruts own beloved home
come hither maruts on your lightning laden cars sounding with sweet songs armed with lances winged with steeds
fly unto us with noblest food like birds o ye of mighty power
with their redhued or haply tawny coursers which speed their chariots on they come for glory
brilliant like gold is he who holds the thunder earth have they smitten with the chariots felly
for beauty ye have swords upon your bodies as they stir woods so may they stir our spirits
for your sake o ye maruts very mighty and wellborn have they set the stone in motion
the days went round you and came back o yearners back to this prayer and to this solemn worship
the gotamas making their prayer with singing have pushed the wells lid up to drink the water
no hymn way ever known like this aforetime which gotama sang forth for you o maruts
what time upon your golden wheels he saw you wild boars rushing about with tusks of iron
to you this freshening draught of soma rusheth o maruts like the voice of one who prayeth
it rusheth freely from our hands as these libations wont to flow

then she who came for friendship maid of noble birth elected you as husbands you to be her lords
rebha ye saved from tyranny for atris sake ye quenched with cold the fiery pit that compassed him

doers of marvels skilful workers ye restored vandana like a car worn out with length of days
from earth ye brought the sage to life in wondrous mode be your great deeds done here for him who honours you

far from our homes without their calves

prepare us for the food that floweth from our cows
i have obtained the horseless car of asvins rich in sacrifice

when o ye deities ye gave that milchcow to the angirases
they milked her aryaman joined with them did the work he knoweth her as well as i
neer may these manly deeds of yours for us grow old never may your bright glories fall into decay never before our time decay
what deed of yours new every age wondrous surpassing man rings forth
whatever maruts may be difficult to gain grant us whateer is hard to gain
dadhyac of old angiras priyamedha these and kanva atri manu knew my birth yea those of ancient days and manu knew
their long line stretcheth to the gods our birthconnexions are with them
to these for their high station i bow down with song to indra agni bow with song
let the invoker bless let offerers bring choice gifts brhaspati the friend doth sacrifice with steers steers that have many an excellence
now with our ears we catch the sound of the pressstone that rings afar
the very strong hath gained the waters by himself the strong gained many a restingplace
o ye eleven gods whose home is heaven o ye eleven who make earth your dwelling
ye who with might eleven live in waters accept this sacrifice o gods with pleasure
to splendid agni seated by the altar loving well his home i bring the food as twere his place of birth
i clothe the bright one with my hymn as with a robe him with the car of light brighthued dispelling gloom
child of a double birth he grasps at triple food in the years course what he hath swallowed grows anew
he by anothers mouth and tongue a noble bull with other as an elephant consumes the trees
the pair who dwell together moving in the dark bestir themselves both parents hasten to the babe
impetuoustongued destroying springing swiftly forth one to be watched and cherished strengthener of his sire
for man thou friend of men these steeds of thine are yoked impatient lightly running ploughing blackened lines
discordantminded fleet gliding with easy speed urged onward by the wind and rapid in their course
dispelling on their way the horror of black gloom making a glorious show these flames of his fly forth
when oer the spacious tract he spreads himself abroad and rushes panting on with thunder and with roar
amid brown plants he stoops as if adorning them and rushes bellowing like a bull upon his wives
proving his might he decks the glory of his form and shakes his horns like one terrific hard to stay
now covered now displayed he grasps as one who knows his restingplace in those who know him well
a second time they wax and gather godlike power and blending both together change their parents form
the maidens with long tresses hold him in embrace dead they rise up again to meet the living one
releasing them from age with a loud roar he comes filling them with new spirit living unsubdued
licking the mantle of the mother far and wide he wanders over fields with beasts that flee apace
strengthening all that walk licking up all around a blackened path forsooth he leaves whereer he goes
o agni shine resplendent with our wealthy chiefs like a loudsnorting bull accustomed to the house
thou casting off thine infant wrappings blazest forth as though thou hadst put on a coat of mail for war
may this our perfect prayer be dearer unto thee than an imperfect prayer although it please thee well
with the pure brilliancy that radiates from thy form mayest thou grant to us abundant store of wealth
grant to our chariot to our house o agni a boat with moving feet and constant oarage
one that may further well our wealthy princes and all the folk and be our certain refuge
welcome our laud with thine approval agni may earth and heaven and freely flowing rivers
yield us long life and food and corn and cattle and may the red dawns choose for us their choicest
yea verily the fair effulgence of the god for glory was established since he sprang from strength
when he inclines thereto successful is the hymn the songs of sacrifice have brought him as they flow
wonderful rich in nourishment he dwells in food next in the seven auspicious mothers is his home
thirdly that they might drain the treasures of the bull the maidens brought forth him for whom the ten provide
what time from out the deep from the steers wondrous form the chiefs who had the power produced him with their strength
when matarisvan rubbed forth him who lay concealed for mixture of the sweet drink in the days of old
when from the highest father he is brought to us amid the plants he rises hungry wondrously
as both together join to expedite his birth most youthful he is born resplendent in his light
then also entered he the mothers and in them pure and uninjured he increased in magnitude
as to the first he rose the vigorous from of old so now he runs among the younger lowest ones
therefore they choose him herald at the morning rites pressing to him as unto bhaga pouring gifts
when muchpraised by the power and will of gods he goes at all times to his mortal worshipper to drink
what time the holy one windurged hath risen up serpentlike winding through the dry grass unrestrained
dust lies upon the way of him who burneth all blackwinged and pure of birth who follows sundry paths
like a swift chariot made by men who know their art he with his red limbs lifts himself aloft to heaven
thy worshippers become by burning black of hue their strength flies as before a heros violence
by thee o agni varuna who guards the law mitra and aryaman the bounteous are made strong
for as the felly holds the spokes thou with thy might pervading hast been born encompassing them round
agni to him who toils and pours libations thou most youthful sendest wealth and all the host of gods
thee therefore even as bhaga will we set anew young child of strength most wealthy in our battlesong
vouchsafe us riches turned to worthy ends good luck abiding in the house and strong capacity
wealth that directs both worlds as they were guidingreins and very wise the gods assent in sacrifice
may he the priest resplendent joyful hear us he with the radiant car and rapid horses
may agni ever wise with best directions to bliss and highest happiness conduct us
with hymns of might hath agni now been lauded advanced to height of universal kingship
now may these wealthy chiefs and we together spread forth as spreads the sun above the rainclouds
to agni i present a newer mightier hymn i bring my words and song unto the son of strength
who offspring of the waters bearing precious things sits on the earth in season dear invoking priest
soon as he sprang to birth that agni was shown forth to matarisvan in the highest firmament
when he was kindled through his power and majesty his fiery splendour made the heavens and earth to shine
his flames that wax not old beams fair to look upon of him whose face is lovely shine with beauteous sheen
the rays of agni him whose active force is light through the nights glimmer sleepless ageless like the floods
send thou with hymns that agni to his own abode who rules one sovran lord of wealth like varuna
him allpossessor whom the bhrgus with their might brought to earths central point the centre of the world
he whom no force can stay even as the maruts roar like to a dart sent forth even as the bolt from heaven
agni with sharpened jaws chews up and eats the trees and conquers them as when the warrior smites his foes
and will not agni find enjoyment in our praise will not the vasu grant our wish with gifts of wealth
will not the inspirer speed our prayers to gain their end him with the radiant glance i laud with this my song
the kindler of the flame wins agni as a friend promoter of the law whose face is bright with oil
inflamed and keen refulgent in our gatherings he lifts our hymn on high clad in his radiant hues
keep us incessantly with guards that cease not agni with guards auspicious very mighty
with guards that never slumber never heedless never beguiled o helper keep our children
the priest goes forth to sacrifice with wondrous power sending aloft the hymn of glorious brilliancy
he moves to meet the ladles turning to the right which are the first to kiss the place where he abides
to him sang forth the flowing streams of holy law encompassed in the home and birthplace of the god
he when he dwelt extended in the waters lap absorbed those godlike powers for which he is adored
seeking in course altern to reach the selfsame end the two copartners strive to win this beauteous form
like bhaga must he be duly invoked by us as he who drives the car holds fast the horses reins
he whom the two copartners with observance tend the pair who dwell together in the same abode
by night as in the day the grey one was born young passing untouched by eld through many an age of man
him the ten fingers the devotions animate we mortals call on him a god to give us help
he speeds over the sloping surface of the land new deeds hath he performed with those who gird him round
for agni like a herdsman thou by thine own might rulest oer all that is in heaven and on the earth
and these two mighty ones bright golden closely joined rolling them round are come unto thy sacred grass
agni accept with joy be glad in this our prayer joygiver selfsustained strong born of holy law
for fair to see art thou turning to every side pleasant to look on as a dwelling filled with food
ask ye of him for he is come he knoweth it he full of wisdom is implored is now implored
with him are admonitions and with him commands he is the lord of strength the lord of power and might
they ask of him not all learn by their questioning what he the sage hath grasped as twere with his own mind
forgetting not the former nor the later word he goeth on not careless in his mental power
to him these ladles go to him these racing mares he only will give ear to all the words i speak
allspeeding victor perfecter of sacrifice the babe with flawless help hath mustered vigorous might
whateer he meets he grasps and then runs farther on and straightway newly born creeps forward with his kin
he stirs the wearied man to pleasure and great joy what time the longing gifts approach him as he comes
he is a wild thing of the flood and forest he hath been laid upon the highest surface
he hath declared the lore of works to mortals agni the wise for he knows law the truthful
i laud the sevenrayed the tripleheaded agni allperfect in his parents bosom
sunk in the lap of all that moves and moves not him who hath filled all luminous realms of heaven
as a great steer he grew to these his parents sublime he stands untouched by eld farreaching
he plants his footsteps on the lofty ridges of the broad earth his red flames lick the udder
coming together to their common youngling both cows fairshaped spread forth in all directions
measuring out the paths that must be travelled entrusting all desires to him the mighty
the prudent sages lead him to his dwelling guarding with varied skill the everyouthful
longing they turned their eyes unto the river to these the sun of men was manifested
born noble in the regions aim of all mens eyes to be implored for life by great and small alike
far as the wealthy one hath spread himself abroad he is the sire allvisible of this progeny
how agni have the radiant ones aspiring endued thee with the vigour of the living
so that on both sides fostering seed and offspring the gods may joy in holy laws fulfilment
mark this my speech divine one thou most youthful offered to thee by him who gives most freely
one hates thee and another sings thy praises i thine adorer laud thy form o agni
thy guardian rays o agni when they saw him preserved blind mamateya from affliction
lord of all riches he preserved the pious the foes who fain would harm them did no mischief
the sinful man who worships not o agni who offering not harms us with doubledealing
be this in turn to him a heavy sentence may he distress himself by his revilings
yea when a mortal knowingly o victor injures with double tongue a fellowmortal
from him praised agni save thou him that lauds thee bring us not into trouble and affliction
what matarisvan piercing formed by friction herald of all the gods in varied figure
is he whom they have set mid human houses gayhued as light and shining forth for beauty
they shall not harm the man who brings thee praises such as i am agni my help approves me
all acts of mine shall they accept with pleasure laudation from the singer who presents it
him in his constant seat men skilled in worship have taken and with praises have established
as harnessed to a chariot fleetfoot horses at his command let bearers lead him forward
wondrous full many a thing he chews and crunches he shines amid the wood with spreading brightness
upon his glowing flames the wind blows daily driving them like the keen shaft of an archer
him whom while yet in embryo the hostile both skilled and fain to harm may never injure
men blind and sightless through his splendour hurt not his neverfailing lovers have preserved him
hither he hastens to give lord of great riches king of the mighty to the place of treasure
the pressingstones shall serve him speeding near us
as steer of men so steer of earth and heaven by glory he whose streams all life hath drunken
who hasting forward rests upon the altar
he who hath lighted up the joyous castle wise courser like the steed of cloudy heaven
bright like the sun with hundredfold existence
he doubly born hath spread in his effulgence through the three luminous realms through all the regions
best sacrificing priest where waters gather

the man who brings him gifts hath noble offspring

what to the envoy agni in reply ye spake a courser must be made a chariot fashioned here
a cow must be created and the twain made young when we have done these things brother we turn to you
when thus o rbhus ye had done ye questioned thus whither went he who came to us a messenger
then tvastar when he viewed the four wrought chalices concealed himself among the consorts of the gods
as tvastar thus had spoken let us slay these men who have reviled the chalice drinkingcup of gods
they gave themselves new names when soma juice was shed and under these new names the maiden welcomed them

of this benignant priest with eld greycoloured the brother midmost of the three is lightning
the third is he whose back with oil is sprinkled here i behold the chief with seven male children
seven to the onewheeled chariot yoke the courser bearing seven names the single courser draws it
threenaved the wheel is sound and undecaying whereon are resting all these worlds of being

who hath beheld him as he sprang to being seen how the boneless one supports the bony
where is the blood of earth the life the spirit who may approach the man who knows to ask it
unripe in mind in spirit undiscerning i ask of these the gods established places
for up above the yearling calf the sages to form a web their own seven threads have woven
i ask unknowing those who know the sages as one all ignorant for sake of knowledge
what was that one who in the unborns image hath stablished and fixed firm these worlds six regions
let him who knoweth presently declare it this lovely birds securely founded station
forth from his head the cows draw milk and wearing his vesture with their foot have drunk the water
the mother gave the sire his share of order with thought at first she wedded him in spirit

they told me these were males though truly females he who hath eyes sees this the blind discerns not
the son who is a sage hath comprehended who knows this rightly is his fathers father
beneath the upper realm above this lower bearing her calf at foot the cow hath risen
witherward to what place hath she departed where calves she not amid this herd of cattle
who that the father of this calf discerneth beneath the upper realm above the lower
showing himself a sage may here declare it whence hath the godlike spirit had its rising
those that come hitherward they call departing those that depart they call directed hither

his mouth she fondly calls to her warm udder and suckles him with milk while gently lowing
he also snorts by whom encompassed round the cow laws as she clings unto the shedder of the rain
she with her shrilling cries hath humbled mortal man and turned to lightning hath stripped off her covering robe
that which hath breath and speed and life and motion lies firmly stablished in the midst of houses
living by offerings to the dead he moveth immortal one the brother of the mortal
i saw the herdsman him who never stumbles approaching by his pathways and departing

i have bestowed the earth upon the arya and rain upon the man who brings oblation
i guided forth the loudlyroaring waters and the gods moved according to my pleasure
in the wild joy of soma i demolished sambaras forts ninetyandnine together
and utterly the hundredth habitation when helping divodasa atithigva
before all birds be ranked this bird o maruts supreme of falcons be this fleetwinged falcon
because strong pinioned with no car to bear him he brought to manu the godloved oblation
when the bird brought it hence in rapid motion sent on the wide path fleet as thought he hurried
swift he returned with sweetness of the soma and hence the falcon hath acquired his glory
bearing the stalk the falcon speeding onward bird bringing from afar the draught that gladdens
friend of the gods brought grasping fast the soma which be bad taken from yon loftiest heaven
the falcon took and brought the soma bearing thousand libations with him yea ten thousand
the bold one left malignities behind him wise in wild joy of soma left the foolish
i as i lay within the womb considered all generations of these gods in order
a hundred iron fortresses confined me but forth i flew with rapid speed a falcon
not at his own free pleasure did he bear me he conquered with his strength and manly courage
straightway the bold one left the fiends behind him and passed the winds as he grew yet more mighty
when with loud cry from heaven down sped the falcon thence hasting like the wind he bore the bold one
then wildly raging in his mind the archer krsanu aimed and loosed the string to strike him
the falcon bore him from heavens lofty summit as the swift car of indras friend bore bhujyu
then downward hither fell a flying feather of the bird hasting forward in his journey
and now let maghavan accept the beaker white filled with milk filled with the shining liquid
the best of sweet meath which the priests have offered that indra to his joy may drink the hero that he may take and drink it to his rapture

indra smote down agni consumed o indu the dasyus ere the noontide in the conflict
of those who gladly sought a hardwon dwelling he cast down many a thousand with his arrow
lower than all besides hast thou o indra cast down the dasyus abject tribes of dasas

from you two came the gifts in days aforetime which trasadasyu granted to the purus
ye gave the winner of our fields and ploughlands and the strong smiter who subdued the dasyus
and ye gave mighty dadhikras the giver of many gifts who visiteth all people
impetuous hawk swift and of varied colour like a brave king whom each true man must honour
whom as twere down a precipice swift rushing each puru praises and his heart rejoices
springing forth like a hero fain for battle whirling the car and flying like the tempest
who gaineth precious booty in the combats and moveth winning spoil among the cattle
shown in bright colour looking on the assemblies beyond the churl to worship of the living
loudly the folk cry after him in battles as twere a thief who steals away a garment
speeding to glory or a herd of cattle even as a hungry falcon swooping downward
and fain to come forth first amid these armies this way and that with rows of cars he rushes
gay like a bridesman making him a garland tossing the dust champing the rein that holds him
and that strong steed victorious and faithful obedient with his body in the combat
speeding straight on amid the swiftly pressing casts oer his brows the dust he tosses upward
and at his thunder like the roar of heaven those who attack tremble and are affrighted
for when he fights against embattled thousands dread is he in his striving none may stay him
the people praise the overpowering swiftness of this fleet steed who giveth men abundance
of him they say when drawing back from battle dadhikras hath sped forward with his thousands
dadhikras hath oerspread the fivefold people with vigour as the sun lightens the waters
may the strong steed who winneth hundreds thousands requite with sweetness these my words and praises
now give we praise to dadhikras the rapid and mention in our laud the earth and heaven
may the dawns flushing move me to exertion and bear me safely over every trouble
i praise the mighty steed who fills my spirit the stallion dadhikravan rich in bounties
whom swift of foot and shining bright as agni ye varuna and mitra gave to purus
him who hath honoured when the flame is kindled at break of dawn the courser dadhikravan
him of one mind with varuna and mitra may aditi make free from all transgression
when we remember mighty dadhikravan our food and strength then the blest name of maruts
varuna mitra we invoke for welfare and agni and the thunderwielding indra
both sides invoke him as they call on indra when they stir forth and turn to sacrificing
to us have varuna and mitra granted the courser dadhikras a guide for mortals
so have i glorified with praise strong dadhikravan conquering steed
sweet may he make our mouths may he prolong the days we have to live
let us recite the praise of dadhikravan may all the mornings move me to exertion
praise of the lord of waters dawn and agni brhaspati son of angiras and surya
brave seeking war and booty dwelling with the good and with the swift may he hasten the food of dawn
may he the true the fleet the lover of the course the birdlike dadhikravan bring food strength and light
his pinion rapid runner fans him m his way as of a bird that hastens onward to its aim
and as it were a falcons gliding through the air strikes dadhikravans side as he speeds on with might
bound by the neck and by the flanks and by the mouth the vigorous courser lends new swiftness to his speed
drawing himself together as his strength allows dadhikras springs along the windings of the paths

mans worship of the gods hath three great lustres and three celestial lights have they established
the maruts gifted with pure strength adore thee for thou o indra art their sapient rsi
what time the maruts sang their song to indra joyous when he had drunk of soma juices
he grasped his thunderbolt to slay the dragon and loosed that they might flow the youthful waters
and o ye brahmans maruts so may indra drink draughts of this my carefully pressed soma
for this oblation found for man the cattle and indra having quaffed it slew the dragon
then heaven and earth he sundered and supported wrapped even in these he struck the beast with terror
so indra forced the engulfer to disgorgement and slew the danava panting against him
thus all the gods o maghavan delivered to thee of their free will the draught of soma
when thou for etasa didst cause to tarry the flying mares of surya racing forward
when maghavan with the thunderbolt demolished his nineandninety castles all together
the maruts where they met glorified indra ye with the trstup hymn obstructed heaven
as friend to aid a friend agni dressed quickly three hundred buffaloes even as he willed it
and indra from mans gift for vrtras slaughter drank ofr at once three lakes of pressedout soma
when thou three hundred buffaloes flesh hadst eaten and drunk as maghavan three lakes of soma
all the gods raised as twere a shout of triumph to indra praise because he slew the dragon
what time ye came with strong steeds swiftly speeding o usana and indra to the dwelling
thou camest thither conquering together with kutsa and the gods thou slewest susna
one carwheel of the sun thou rolledst forward and one thou settest free to move for kutsa
thou slewest noseless dasyus with thy weapon and in their home oerthrewest hostile speakers
the lauds of gauriviti made thee mighty to vidathins son as prey thou gavest pipru
rjisivan drew thee into friendship dressing the sacred food and thou hast drunk his soma
navagvas and dasgvas with libations of soma juice sing hymns of praise to indra
labouring at their task the men laid open the stall of kine though firmly closed and fastened
how shall i serve thee maghavan though knowing full well what hero deeds thou hast accomplished
and the fresh deeds which thou wilt do most mighty these too will we tell forth in sacred synods
resistless from of old through hero courage thou hast done all these many acts o indra
what thou wilt do in bravery thunderwielder none is there who may hinder this thy prowess
indra accept the prayers which now are offered accept the new prayers mightiest which we utter
like fair and wellmade robes i seeking riches as a deft craftsman makes a car have wrought them
where is that hero who hath looked on indra borne on lightrolling car by tawny coursers
who thunderer seeks with wealth the somapresser and to his house goes muchinvoked to aid him
i have beheld his strong and secret dwelling longing have sought the founders habitation
i asked of others and they said in answer may we awakened men attain to indra
we will tell indra when we pour libation what mighty deeds thou hast performed to please us
let him who knows not learn who knows them listen hither rides maghavan with all his army
indra when born thou madest firm thy spirit alone thou seekest war to fight with many
with might thou clavest een the rock asunder and foundest out the stable of the milchkine
when thou wast born supremest at a distance bearing a name renowned in faroff regions
since then een gods have been afraid of indra he conquered all the floods which served the dasa
these blissful maruts sing their psalm to praise thee and pour to thee libation of the soma
indra with wondrous powers subdued the dragon the guileful lurker who beset the waters
thou maghavan from the first didst scatter foemen speeding while joying in the milk the giver
there seeking mans prosperity thou torest away the head of namuci the dasa
pounding the head of namuci the dasa me too thou madest thine associate indra
yea and the rolling stone that is in heaven both worlds as on a car brought to the maruts
women for weapons hath the dasa taken what injury can his feeble armies to me
well he distinguished his two different voices and indra then advanced to fight the dasyu
divided from their calves the cows went lowing around on every side hither and thither
these indra reunited with his helpers what time the wellpressed soma made him joyful
what time the somas mixed by babhru cheered him loud the steer bellowed in his habitations
so indra drank thereof the fortdestroyer and gave him guerdon in return of milchkine
this good deed have the rusamas done agni that they have granted me four thousand cattle
we have received rnancayas wealth of heroes the most heroic which was freely offered
the rusamas o agni sent me homeward with fair adornment and with kine in thousands
the strong libations have made indra joyful when night whose course was ending changed to morning
night wellnigh ended at rnancayas coming king of the rusamas was changed to morning
like a strong courser fleet of foot urged onward babhru hath gained four thousand as his guerdon
we have received four thousand head of cattle presented by the rusamas o agni
and we the singers have received the caldron of metal which was heated for pravargya
maghavan indra turns his chariot downward the strengthdisplaying car which he hath mounted
even as a herdsman driveth forth his cattle he goeth first uninjured fain for treasure
haste to us lord of bays be not ungracious visit us lover of goldhued oblation
there is naught else better than thou art indra een to the wifeless hast thou given spouses
when out of strength arose the strength that conquers indra displayed all powers that he possesses
forth from the cave he drove the milky mothers and with the light laid bare investing darkness
anus have wrought a chariot for thy courser and tvastar muchinvoked thy bolt that glitters
the brahmans with their songs exalting indra increased his strength that he might slaughter ahi
when heroes sang their laud to thee the hero indra and stones and aditi accordant
without or steed or chariot were the fellies which sped by indra rolled upon the dasytis
i will declare thine exploits wrought aforetime and maghavan thy deeds of late achievement
when lord of might thou sunderedst earth and heaven winning for man the moistlygleaming waters
this is thy deed een this wonderful singer that slaying ahi here thy strength thou showedst
didst check and stay een gusnas wiles and magic and drawing nigh didst chase away the dasytis
thou indra on the farther bank foryadu and turvaga didst stay the gushing waters
ye both assailed the fierce thou barest kutsa when gods and usana came to you together
let the steeds bring you both indra and kutsa borne on the chariot within hearingdistance
ye blew him from the waters from his dwelling and chased the darkness from the nobles spirit
even this sage hath come looking for succour even to vatas docile harnessed horses
here are the maruts all thy dear companions prayers have increased thy power and might o indra
when night was near its close he carried forward een the suns chariot backward in its running
etaga brought his wheel and firmly stays it setting it eastward he shall give us courage
this indra o ye men hath come to see you seeking a friend who hath expressed the soma
the creaking stone is laid upon the altar and the adhvaryus come to turn it quickly

love thou the pious and to these thy peoplewith whom may we be numberedgive thou vigour
boundless and wasting not the heavenly food of gods goes to the foeless one doer of wondrous deeds
press out make ready offer gifts with special zeal to him whom many laud accepter of the prayer
he who filled full his belly with the somas juice maghavan was delighted with the meaths sweet draught
when usana that he might slay the monstrous beast gave him the mighty weapon with a thousand points
illustrious is the man whoever presseth out soma for him in sunshine or in cloud and rain
the mighty maghavan who is the sages friend advanceth more and more his beauteous progeny
the strong god doth not flee away from him whose sire whose mother or whose brother he hath done to death
he the avenger seeketh this mans offered gifts this god the source of riches doth not flee from sin
he seeks no enterprise with five or ten to aid nor stays with him who pours no juice though prospering well
the shaker conquers or slays in this way or that and to the pious gives a stable full of kine
exceeding strong in war he stays the chariot wheel and hating him who pours not prospers him who pours
indra the terrible tamer of every man as arya leads away the dasa at his will
he gathers up for plunder all the niggards gear excellent wealth he gives to him who offers gifts
not even in wide stronghold may all the folk stand firm who have provoked to anger his surpassing might
when indra maghavan hath marked two wealthy men fighting for beauteous cows with all their followers
he who stirs all things takes one as his close ally and shaker with his heroes sends the kine to him

what time thou smotest down svarbhanus magic that spread itself beneath the sky o indra
by his fourth sacred prayer atri disoovered surya concealed in gloom that stayed his function
let not the oppressor with this dread through anger swallow me up for i am thine o atri
mitra art thou the sender of true blessings thou and king varuna be both my helpers
the brahman atri as he set the pressstones serving the gods with praise and adoration

these who wear hairknots on the right the movers of holy thought whiterobed have won me over
i warned the men when from the grass i raised me not from afar can my vasisthas help you
with soma they brought indra from a distance over vaisanta from the strong libation
indra preferred vasisthas to the soma pressed by the son of vayata pasadyumna
so verily with these he crossed the river in company with these he slaughtered bheda
so in the fight with the ten kings vasisthas did indra help sudas through your devotions
i gladly men i with prayer prayed by our fathers have fixed your axle ye shall not be injured
since when ye sang aloud the sakvari verses vasisthas ye invigorated indra
like thirsty men they looked to heaven in battle with the ten kings surrounded and imploring
then indra heard vasistha as he praised him and gave the trtsus ample room and freedom
like sticks and staves wherewith they drive the cattle stripped bare the bharatas were found defenceless
vasistha then became their chief and leader then widely were the trtsus clans extended
three fertilize the worlds with genial moisture three noble creatures cast a light before them
three that give warmth to all attend the morning all these have they discovered these vasisthas
like the suns growing glory is their splendour and like the seas is their unflathomed greatness
their course is like the winds your laud vasisthas can never be attained by any other
they with perceptions of the heart in secret resort to that which spreads a thousand branches
the apsaras brought hither the vasisthas wearing the vesture spun for them by yama
a form of lustre springing from the lightning wast thou when varuna and mitra saw thee
tliy one and only birth was then vasistha when from thy stock agastya brought thee hither
born of their love for urvasi vasistha thou priest art son of varuna and mitra
and as a fallen drop in heavenly fervour all the gods laid thee on a lotusblossorn
he thinker knower both of earth and heaven endowed with many a gift bestowing thousands
destined to wear the vesture spun by yama sprang from the apsaras to life vasistha
born at the sacrifice urged by adorations both with a common flow bedewed the pitcher
then from the midst thereof there rose up mana and thence they say was born the sage vasistha
he brings the bearer of the laud and saman first shall he speak bringing the stone for pressing
with grateful hearts in reverence approach him to you o pratrdas vasistha cometh

bipeds and quadrupeds with several hopes and aims and birds have settled to their tasks
singing their praise with godlike thought let us invoke each god for grace
each god to bring you help each god to strengthen you
for of one spirit are the gods with mortal man cosharers all of gracious gifts
may they increase our strength hereafter and today providing case and ample room
i laud you o ye guileless gods here where we meet to render praise
none varuna and mitra harins the mortal man who honours and obeys your laws
he makes his house endure he gathers plenteous food who pays obedience to your will
born in his sons anew he spreads as law commands and prospers every way unharmed
een without war he gathers wealth and goes hisway on pleasant paths
whom mitra varuna and aryaman protect sharing the giftof one accord
een on the plain for him ye make a sloping path an easy way where road is none
and far away from him the ineffectual shaft must vanish shot at him in vain
if ye appoint the rite today kind rulers when the sun ascends
lords of all wealth at sunset or at wakingtime or be it at the noon of day
or asuras when ye have sheltered the worshipper who goes to sacrifice at eve
may we o vasus ye possessors of all wealth come then into the midst of you
if ye today at sunrise or at noon or in the gloom of eve
lords of all riches give fair treasure to the man the wise man who hath sacrificed
then we imperial rulers claim of you this boon your wide protection as a son
may we adityas offering holy gifts obtain that which shall bring us greater bliss
the thirty gods and three besides whose seat hath been the sacred grass
from time of old have found and gained
varuna mitra aryaman agnis with consorts sending boons

another luminous occupies the place of sacritice sage among the gods
one brandishes in his hand an iron knife firm in his seat amid the deities
another holds the thunderbolt wherewith he slays the vrtras resting in his hand
another bears a pointed weapon bright is he and strong with healing medicines
another thieflike watches well the ways and knows the places where the treasures lie
another with his mighty stride hath made his three steps thither where the gods rejoice
two with one dame ride on with winged steeds and journey forth like travellers on their way
two highest in the heavens have set their seat worshipped with holy oil imperial kings
some singing lauds conceived the samahymn great hymn whereby they caused the sun to shine

whose radiant splendours flow like sounds about us his who is lofty brilliant and effulgent
who reaches heaven with best and brightest lustres sportive and piercing even to the summit
his powers whose chariot fellies gleam and glitter have loudly roared while as with teams he hasted
he the most godlike farextending envoy shines with flames ancient resonant whitelyshining
so bring us ample wealth seat thee as envoy of the two youthful matrons earth and heaven
let agni rapid with his rapid horses impetuous with impetuous steeds come hither
to thee will send praise and bring oblation as thou hast merited lauds when we invoked thee
a fountain in the desert art thou agni o ancient king to man who fain would worship
thou unto whom resort the gathered people as the kine seek the warm stall o most youthful
thou art the messenger of gods and mortals and goest glorious with thy light between them
making thee grow as twere some noble infant thy mother nurtures thee with sweet affection
over the desert slopes thou passest longing and seekest like some beast set free thy fodder
foolish are we o wise and free from error verily agni thou dost know thy grandeur
there lies the form he moves and licks and swallows and as houselord kisses the youthful maiden
he rises ever fresh in ancient fuel smokebannered gray he makes the wood his dwelling
no swimmer steer he presses through the waters and to his place accordant mortals bear him
like thieves who risk their lives and haunt the forest the twain with their ten girdles have secured him
this is a new hymn meant for thee o agni yoke as it were thy car with parts that glitter
homage and prayer are thine o jatavedas and this my song shall evermore exalt thee
agni protect our children and descendants and guard with everwatcliful care our bodies
he only is the sea holder of treasures born many a time he views the hearts within us
he hides him in the secret couples bosom the bird dwells in the middle of the fountain
inhabiting one dwellingplace in common strong stallions and the mares have come together
the sages guard the seat of holy order and keep the highest names concealed within them
the holy pair of wondrous power have coupled they formed the infant they who bred produced him
the central point of all that moves and moves not the while they wove the sages thread with insight
for tracks of order and refreshing viands attend from ancient times the goodly infant
wearing him as a mantle earth and heaven grow strong by food of pleasant drink and fatness
he calling loudly to the seven red sisters hath skilled in sweet drink brought them to be looked on
he born of old in middle air hath halted and sought and found the covering robe of pusan
seven are the pathways which the wise have fashioned to one of these may come the troubled mortal
he standeth in the dwelling of the highest a pillar on sure ground where paths are parted
not being being in the highest heaven in aditis bosom and in daksas birthplace
is agni our firstborn of holy order the milchcow and the bull in lifes beginning
this is that agni he by whose protection favour and help the singer is successful
who with the noblest flames of glowing fuel comes forth encompassed with farspreading lustre
agni the holy one the everlasting who shines far beaming with celestial splendours
he who hath come unto his friends with friendship like a fleet steed who never trips or stumbles
he who is lord of all divine oblation shared by all living men at break of morning
agni to whom our offerings are devoted in whom rests he whose car through might is scatheless
increasing by his strength while lauds content him with easy flight unto the gods he travels
agni the cheerful priest best sacrificer balms with his tongue the gods with whom he mingles
with songs and adorations bring ye hither agni who stirs himself at dawn like indra
whom sages laud with hymns as jatavedas of those who wield the sacrificial ladle
in whom all goodly treasures meet together even as steeds and riders for the booty
inclining hither bring us help o agni even assistance most desired by indra
yea at thy birth when thou hadst sat in glory thou agni wast the aim of invocations
the gods came near obedient to thy sunimons and thus attained their rank as chief protectors
o agni shared by all men living bring us good luck for sacrifice from earth and heaven
with us be thine intelligence wonderworker protect us god with thy farreaching blessings
these hymns brought forth for thee o agni laud thee for bounteous gifts with cattle and with horses
good lord when man from thee hath gained enjoyment by hymns o noblyborn hath he obtained it
agni i deem my kinsman and my father count him my brother and my friend for ever
i honour as the face of lofty agni in heaven the bright and holy light of surya
effectual agni are our prayers for profit he whom at home thou priest for ever guardest
is rich in food drawn by red steeds and holy by day and night to him shall all be pleasant
men with their arms have generated agni helpful as some kind friend adorned with splendours
and stablished as invoker mid the people the ancient priest the sacrifices lover
worship thyself o god the gods in heaven what void of knowledge shall the fool avail thee
as thou o god hast worshipped gods by seasons so noblyborn to thine own self pay worship
agni be thou our guardian and protector bestow upon us life and vital vigour
accept o mighty one the gifts we offer and with unceasing care protect our bodies
agni advances with his lofty banner the bull is bellowing to the earth and heavens
he hath attained the skys supremest limits the steer hath waxen in the lap of waters
the bull the youngling with the hump hath frolicked the strong and neverceasing calf hath bellowed
bringing our offerings to the gods assembly he moves as chief in his own dwellingplaces
him who hath grasped his parents head they stablished at sacrifice a wave of heavenly lustre
in his swift flight the red dawns borne by horses refresh their bodies in the home of order
for vasu thou precedest every morning and still hast been the twins illuminator
for sacrifice seven places thou retainest while for thine own self thou engenderest mitra
thou art the eye and guard of mighty order and varuna when to sacrifice thou comest
thou art the waters child o jatavedas envoy of him whose offering thou acceptest
thou art the leader of the rite and region to which with thine auspicious teams thou teadest
thy lightbestowing head to heaven thou liftest making thy tongue the oblationbearer agni
through his wise insight trita in the cavern seeking as ever the chief sires intention
carefully tended in his parents bosom calling the weapons kin goes forth to combat
wellskilled to use the weapons of his father aptya urged on by indra fought the battle
then trita slew the foe sevenrayed threeheaded and freed the cattle of the son of tvastar
lord of the brave indra cleft him in pieces who sought to gain much strength and deemed him mighty
he smote his three heads from his body seizing the cattle of the oniniform son of tvastar
ye waters are beneficent so help ye us to energy
that we may look on great delight
give us a portion of the sap the most auspicious that ye have
like mothers in their longing love
to you we gladly come for him to whose abode ye send us on
and waters give us procreant strength
the waters be to us for drink goddesses for our aid and bliss
let them stream to us health and strength
beg the floods to give us balm these queens who rule oer precious things
and have supreme control of men
within the waterssoma thus hath told medwell all balms that heal
and agni he who blesseth all
o waters teem with medicine to keep my body safe from harm
so that i long may see the sun
whatever sin is found in me whatever evil i have wrought
if i have lied or falsely sworn waters remove it far from me
the waters i this day have sought and to their moisture have we come
o agni rich in milk come thou and with thy splendour cover me
fain would i win my friend to kindly friendship so may the sage come through the airs wide ocean
remembering the earth and days to follow obtain a son the issue of his father
thy friend loves not the friendship which considers her who is near in kindred as stranger
sons of the mighty asura the heroes supporters of the heavens see far around them
yea this the immortals seek of thee with longing progeny of the sole existing mortal
then let thy soul and mine be knit together and as a loving husband take thy consort
shall we do now what we neer did aforetime we who spake righteously now talk impurely
gandharva in the floods the dame of waterssuch is our bond such our most lofty kinship
even in the womb god tvastar vivifier shaping all forms creator made us consorts
none violates his holy ordinances that we are his the heavens and earth acknowledge
who knows that earliest day whereof thou speakest who hatb beheld it who can here declare it
great is the law of varuna and mitra what wanton wilt thou say to men to tempt them
i yami am possessed by love of yama that i may rest on the same couch beside him
i as a wife would yield me to my husband like carwheels let us speed to meet each other
they stand not still they never close their eyelids those sentinels of gods who wander round us
not mego quickly wanton with another and hasten like a chariot wheel to meet him
may suryas eye with days and nights endow him and ever may his light spread out before him
in heaven and earth the kindred pair commingle on yam be the unbrotherly act of yama
sure there will come succeeding times when brothers and sisters will do acts unmeet for kinsfolk
not me o fair oneseek another husband and make thine arm a pillow for thy consort
is he a brother when no lord is left her is she a sister when destruction cometh
forced by my love these many words i utter come near and hold me in thy close embraces
i will not fold mine arms about thy body they call it sin when one comes near his sister
not meprepare thy pleasures with another thy brother seeks not this from thee o fair one
alas thou art indeed a weakling yama we find in thee no trace of heart or spirit
as round the tree the woodbine clings another will cling albout thee girt as with a girdle
embrace another yami let another even as the woodbine rings the tree enfold thee
win thou his heart and let him win thy fancy and he shall form with thee a blest alliance
the bull hath yielded for the bull the milk of heaven the son of aditi can never be deceived
according to his wisdom varuna knoweth all may he the holy hallow times for sacrifice
gandharvi spake may she the lady of the flood amid the rivers roaring leave my heart untouched
may aditi accomplish all that we desire and may our eldest brother tell us this as chief
yea even this blessed morning rich in store of food splendid with heavenly lustre hath shone out for man
since they as was the wish of yearning gods brought forth that yearning agni for the assembly as the priest
and the fleet falcon brought for sacrifice from afar this flowing drop most excellent and keen of sight
then when the aryan tribes chose as invoking priest agni the wonderworker and the hymn rose up
still art thou kind to him who feeds thee as with grass and skilled in sacrifice offers thee holy gifts
when thou having received the sages strengthening food with lauds after long toil cornest with many more
urge thou thy parents as a lover to delight the lovely one desires and craves it from his heart
the priest calls out the sacrificer shows his skill the asura tries his strength and with the hymn is stirred
farfamed is he the mortal man o agni thou son of strength who hath obtained thy favour
he gathering power borne onward by his horses makes his days lovely in his might and splendour
when holy agni the divine assembly the sacred synod mid the gods is gathered
and when thou godlike one dealest forth treasures vouchsafe us too our portion of the riches
hear us o agni in your common dwelling harness thy rapid car of amrta
bring heaven and earth the deities parents hither stay with us here nor from the gods be distant
i yoke with prayer your ancient inspiration may the laud rise as on the princes pathway
all sons of immortality shall hear it all the possessors of celestial natures
when speeding ye came nigh us like twin sisters religioushearted votaries brought you forward
take your place ye who know your proper station be near be very near unto our soma
five paces have i risen from earth i follow her who hath four feet with devout observance
this by the sacred syllable have i measured i purify in the central place of order
he for gods sake chose death to be his portion he chose not for mens good a life eternal
they sacrificed brhaspati the rsi yama delivered up his own dear body
the seven flow to the youth on whom the maruts wait the sons unto the father brought the sacrifice
both these are his as his they are the lords of both both toil belonging unto both they prosper well
may they ascend the lowest highest midmost the fathers who deserve a share of soma
may they who have attained the life of spirits gentle and righteous aid us when we call them
now let us pay this homage to the fathers to those who passed of old and those who followed
those who have rested in the earthly region and those who dwell among the mighty races
have attained the graciousminded fathers i have gained son and progeny from visnu
they who enjoy pressed juices with oblation seated on sacred grass come oftenest hither
fathers who sit on sacred grass come help us these offerings have we made for you accept them
so come to us with most auspicious favour and give us health and strength without a trouble
may they the fathers worthy of the soma invited to their favourite oblations
laid on the sacred grass come nigh and listen may they be gracious unto us and bless us
bowing your bended knees and seated southward accept this sacrifice of ours with favour
punish us not for any sin o fathers which we through human frailty have committed
lapped in the bosom of the purple mornings give riches to the man who brings oblations
grant to your sons a portion of that treasure and present give them energy ye fathers
our ancient fathers who deserve the soma who came most noble to our soma banquet
with these let yama yearning with the yearning rejoicing eat our offerings at his pleasure
come to us agni with the gracioug fathers who dwell in glowing light the very kavyas
who thirsted mid the gods who hasten hither oblation winners theme of singers praises
come agni come with countless ancient fathers dwellers in light primeval godadorers
eaters and drinkers of oblations truthful who travel with the deities and indra
fathers whom agnis flames have tasted come ye nigh ye kindly leaders take ye each your proper place

thou agni jatavedas when entreated didst bear the offerings which thou madest fragrant
and give them to the fathers who did cat them with svadha eat thou god the gifts we bring thee
thou jatavedas knowest well the number of fathers who are here and who are absent
of fathers whom we know and whom we know not accept the sacrifice wellprepared with portions
they who consumed by fire or not cremated joy in their offering in the midst of heaven
grant them o sovran lord the world of spirits and their own body as thy pleasure wills it
burn him not up nor quite consume him agni let not his body or his skin be scattered
o jatavedas when thou hast matured him then send him on his way unto the fathers
when thou hast made him ready jatavedas then do thou give him over to the fathers
when he attains unto the life that waits him he shall become the deities controller
the sun receive thine eye tne wind thy spirit go as thy merit is to earth or heaven
go if it be thy lot unto the waters go make thine home in plants with all thy members
thy portion is the goat with heat consume him let thy fierce flame thy glowing splendour burn him
with thine auspicious forms o jatavedas bear this man to the region of the pious
again o agni to the fathers send him who offered in thee goes with our oblations
wearing new life let him increase his offspring let him rejoin a body jatavedas
what wound soeer the dark bird hath inflicted the emmet or the serpent or the jackal
may agni who devoureth all things heal it and soma who hath passed into the brahmans
shield thee with flesh against the flames of agni encompass thee about with fat and marrow
so will the bold one eager to attack thee with fierce glow fail to girdle and consume thee
forbear o agni to upset this ladle the gods and they who merit soma love it
this ladle this which serves the gods to drink from in this the immortal deities rejoice them
send afar flesh eating agni bearing off stains may he depart to yamas subjects
but let this other jatavedas carry oblation to the gods for he is skilful
i choose as god for fatherworship agni flesheater who hath past within your dwelling
while looking on this other jatavedas let him light flames in the supreme assembly
with offerings meet let agni bring the fathers who support the law
let him announce oblations paid to fathers and to deities
right gladly would we set thee down right gladly make thee burn and glow
gladly bring yearning fathers nigh to cat the food of sacrifice
cool agni and again refresh the spot which thou hast scorched and burnt
here let the waterlily grow and tender grass and leafy herb
o full of coolness thou cool plant full of fresh moisture freshening herb
come hither with the female frog fill with delight this agni here
tvastar prepares the bridal of his daughter all the world hears the tidings and assembles
but yamas mother spouse of great vivasvan vanished as she was carried to her dwelling
from mortal men they hid the immortal lady made one like her and gave her to vivasvan
saranyu brought to him the asvin brothers and then deserted both twinned pairs of children
guard of the world whose cattle neer are injured may pusan bear thee hence for he hath knowledge
may he consign thee to these fathers keeping and to the gracious gods let agni give thee
may ayu giver of all life protect thee and bear thee forward on the distant pathway
thither let savitar the god transport thee where dwell the pious who have passedbefore thee
pusan knows all these realms may he conduct us by ways that are most free from fear and danger
giver of blessings glowing allheroic may he thewise and watchful go before us
pusan was born to move on distant pathways on the road far from earth and far from heaven
to both most wonted places of assembly he travels and returns with perfect knowledge
the pious call sarasvati they worship sarasvati while sacrifice proceedeth
the pious called sarasvati aforetime sarasvati send bliss to him who giveth
sarasvati who camest with the fathers with them rejoicing thee in our oblations
seated upon this sacred grass be joyful and give us strengthening food that brings no sickness
thou called on as sarasvati by fathers who come right forward to our solemn service
give food and wealth to present sacrificers a portion worth a thousand of refreshment
the mother floods shall make us bright and shining cleansers of holy oil with oil shall cleanse us
for goddesses they bear off all defilement i rise up from them purified and brightened
through days of earliest date the drop descended on this place and on that which was before it
i offer up throughout the seven oblations the drop which still to one same place is moving
the drop that falls thy stalk which arms have shaken which from the bosom of the press hath fallen
or from the adhvaryus purifying filter i offer thee with heart and cry of vasat
that fallen drop of thine the stalk which from the ladle fell away
this present god brhaspati shall pour it forth to make us rich
the plants of earth are rich in milk and rich in milk is this my speech
and rich in milk the essence of the waters make me pure therewith

i slay the man who brings no milkoblation unrighteous powerful the truths perverter
then will i when i lead my friends to battle against the radiant persons of the godless
prepare for thee at home a vigorous bullock and pour for thee the fifteenfold strong juices
i know not him who sayeth and declareth that he hath slain the godless in the battle
soon as they see the furious combat raging men speak forth praises of my vigorous horses
while yet my deeds of might were unrecorded all passed for maghavans though i existed
the potent one who dwelt in peace i conquered grasped by the foot and slew him on the mountain
none hinder me in mine heroic exploits no not the mountains when i will and purpose
even the deaf will tremble at my roaring and every day will dust be agitated
to see the indraless oblationdrinkers mean offerers oertaken by destruction
then shall the fellies of my car pass over those who have blamed my joyous friend and scorned him
thou wast thou grewest to full vital vigour an earlier saw a later one shall see thee
two canopies as twere are round about him who reacheth to the limit of this region
the freed kine eat the barley of the pious saw them as they wandered with the herdsman
the calling of the pious rang around them what portion will these kine afford their owner
when we who cat the grass of men are gathered i am with barleyeaters in the cornland
there shall the captor yoke the yokeless bullock and he who hath been yoked seek one to loose him
there wilt thou hold as true my spoken purpose to bring together quadrupeds and bipeds
i will divide without a fight his riches who warreth here against the bull with women
when a mans daughter hath been ever eyeless who knowing will be wroth with her for blindness
which of the two will loose on him his angerthe man who leads her home or he who woos her
how many a maid is pleasing to the suitor who fain would marry for her splendid riches
if the girl be both good and fair of feature she finds herself a friend among the people
his feet have grasped he eats the man who meets him around his head he sets the head for shelter
sitting anear and right above he smites us and follows earth that lies spread out beneath him

loud hath she lowed licking anothers offspring in what world hath the cow laid down her udder
seven heroes from the nether part ascended and from the upper part came eight together
nine from behind came armed with winnowingbaskets ten from the front pressed oer the rocks high ridges
one of the ten the tawny shared in common they send to execute their final purpose
the mother carries on her breast the infant of noble form and soothes it while it knows not
the heroes dressed with fire the fatted wether the dice were thrown by way of sport and gaming
two reach the plain amid the heavenly waters hallowing and with means of purifying
crying aloud they ran in all directions one half of them will cook and not the other
to me hath savitar this god declared it he will perform whose food is wood and butter
i saw a troop advancing from the distance moved not by wheels but their own godlike nature
the friendly one seeks human generations destroying still new bands of evil beings
these my two bulls even pramaras are harnessed drive them not far here let them often linger
the waters even shall aid him to his object and the allcleansing sun who is above us
this is the thunderbolt which often whirleth down from the lofty misty realm of surya
beyond this realm there is another glory so through old age they pass and feel no sorrow
bound fast toevery tree the cow is lowing and thence the manconsuming birds are flying
then all this world though pressing juice for indra and strengthening the rsi is affrighted
in the gods mansion stood the firstcreated and from their separation came the later
three warm the earth while holding stores of water and two of these convey the murmuring moisture
this is thy life and do thou mark and know it as such hide not thyself in time of battle
he manifests the light and hides the vapour his foot is never free from robes that veil it
now all my other friends are here assembled my sireinlaw alone hath not come hither
so might he eat the grain and drink the soma and satisfied return unto his dwelling
loud belloweth the bull whose horns are sharpened upon the height above earths breadth he standeth
that man i guard and save in all his troubles who fills my flanks when he hath shed the soma
men with the stone press out for thee o indra strong gladdening soma and thereof thou drinkest
bulls they dress for thee and of these thou eatest when maghavan with food thou art invited
resolve for me o singer this my riddle the rivers send their swelling water backward
the fox steals up to the approaching lion the jackal drives the wildboar from the brushwood
how shall i solve this riddle i the simple declare the thought of thee the wise and mighty
tell us well knowing as befits the season whitherward is thy prosperous car advancing
thus do they magnify me me the mighty higher than even high heaven is my carpole
i all at once demolish many thousands my sire begot me with no foe to match me
yea and the gods have known me also indra as mighty fierce and strong in every exploit
exulting with the bolt i slaughtered vrtra and for the offerer oped with might the cowstall
the deities approached they carried axes splitting the wood they came with their attendants
they laid good timber in the firereceivers and burnt the grass up where they found it growing
the hare hath swallowed up the opposing razor i sundered with a clod the distant mountain
the great will i make subject to the little the calf shall wax in strength and cat the bullock
there hath the strongwinged eagle left his talon as a snared lion leaves the trap that caught him
even the wild steer in his thirst is captured the leather strap still holds his foot entangled
so may the leather strap their foot entangle who fatten on the viands of the brahman
they all devour the bulls set free to wander while they themselves destroy their bodies vigour
they were well occupied with holy duties who sped in person with their lauds to soma
speaking like man mete to us wealth and booty in heaven thou hast the name and fame of hero
as sits the young bird on the tree rejoicing ye swift pair have been roused by clear laudation
whose heraldpriest through many days is indra earths guardian friend of men the best of heroes
may we when this dawn and the next dance hither be thy best servants most heroic hero
let the victorious car with triple splendour bring hitherward the hundred chiefs with kutsa
what was the gladdening draught that pleased thee indra speed through our doors to songs for thou art mighty
why comest thou to me what gift attracts thee fain would i bring thee food most meet to offer
indra what fame hath one like thee mid heroes with what plan wilt thou act why hast thou sought us
as a true friend widestrider to sustain us since food absorbs the thought of each among us
speed happily those as surya ends his journey who meet his wish as bridegrooms meet their spouses
men who present o indra strong by nature with food the many songs that tell thy praises
thine are two measures indra widewellmeted heaven for thy majesty earth for thy wisdom
here for thy choice are somas mixed with butter may the sweet meath be pleasant for thy drinking
they have poured out a bowl to him to indra full of sweet juice for faithful is his bounty
oer earths expanse hath he grown great by wisdom the friend of man and by heroic exploits
indra hath conquered in his wars the mighty men strive in multitudes to win his friendship
ascend thy chariot as it were in battle which thou shalt drive to us with gracious favour
as twere with swift exertion of the spirit let the priest speed to the celestial waters
the glorious food of varuna and mitra to him who spreadeth far this laud i offer
adhvaryus he ye ready with oblations and come with longing to the longing waters
down on which looks the purpletinted eagle pour ye that flowing wave this day defthanded
go to the reservoir o ye adhvaryus worship the waters child with your oblations
a consecrated wave he now will give you so press for him the soma rich in sweetness
he who shines bright in floods unfed with fuel whom sages worship at their sacrifices
give waters rich in sweets child of the waters even those which gave heroic might to indra
those in which soma joys and is delighted as a young man with fair and pleasant damsels
go thou unto those waters o adhvaryu and purify with herbs what thou infusest
so maidens bow before the youthful gallant who comes with love to them who yearn to meet him
in heart accordant and in wish oneminded are the adhvaryus and the heavenly waters
he who made room for you when fast imprisoned who freed you from the mighty imprecation
even to that indra send the meathrich current the wave that gratifies the gods o waters
send forth to him the meathrich wave o rivers which is your offspring and a well of sweetness
oilbalmed to be implored at sacrifices ye wealthy waters hear mine invocation
send forth the rapturegiving wave o rivers which indra drinks which sets the twain in motion
the well that springeth from the clouds desirous that wandereth tripleformed distilling transport
these winding streams which with their double current like cattleraiders seek the lower pastures
waters which dwell together thrive together queens mothers of the world these rsi honour
send forth our sacrifice with holy worship send forth the hymn and prayer for gain of riches
for need of sacrifice disclose the udder give gracious hearing to our call o waters
for wealthy waters ye control all treasures ye bring auspicious intellect and amrta
ye are the queens of independent riches sarasvati give full life to the singer
when i behold the waters coming hither carrying with them milk and mcath and butter
bearing the wellpressed soma juice to indra they harmonize in spirit with adhvaryus
rich they are come with wealth for living beings o friends adhvaryus seat them in their places
seat them on holy grass ye somabringers in harmony with the offspring of the waters
now to this grass are come the longing waters the pious ones are seated at our worship
adbvaryus press the soma juice for indra so will the service of the gods be easy
may benediction of the gods approach us holy to aid us with all rapid succours
therewith may we be happily befriended and pass triumphant over all our troubles
a man should think on wealth and strive to win it by adoration on the path of order
counsel himself with his own mental insight and grasp still nobler vigour with his spirit
the hymn is formed poured are the allotted portions as to a ford friends come unto the wondrous
we have obtained the power of case and comfort we have become acquainted with immortals
pleased be the eternal lord who loves the household with this man whom god savitar created
may bhaga aryaman grace him with cattle may he appear to him and be delightful
like the dawns dwellingplace be this assembly where in their might men rich in food have gathered
striving to share the praises of this singer to us come strengthening and effectual riches
this bulls most gracious farextended favour existed first of all in full abundance
by his support they are maintained in common who in the asuras mansion dwell together
what was the tree what wood in sooth produced it from which they fashioned forth the earth and heaven
these twain stand fast and wax not old for ever these have sung praise to many a day and morning
not only here is this more is beyond us he is the bull the heavens and earths supporter
with power divine he makes his skin a filter when the bay coursers bear him on as surya
he passes oer the broad earth like a stega he penetrates the world as wind the mistcloud
he balmed with oil near varuna and mitra like agni in the wood hath shot forth splendour
when suddenly called the cow that erst was barren she selfprotected ended all her troubles
earth when the first son sprang from sire and mother cast up the gami that which men were seeking
to nrsads son they gave the name of kainva and he the brownhued courser won the treasure
for him darkcoloured streamed the shining udder none made it swell for him thus order willed it
forth speed the pair to bring the meditating god benevolent with boons sent in return for boons
may indra graciously accept both gifts from us when he hath knowledge of the flowing soma juice
thou wanderest far o indra through the spheres of light and realms of earth the region thou whom many praise
let those who often bring their solemn rites conquer the noisy babblers who present no gifts
more beautiful than beauty must this seem to me when the son duly careth for his parents line
the wife attracts the husband with a shout of joy the mans auspicious marriage is performed aright
this beauteous place of meeting have i looked upon where like milchcows the kine order the marriage train
where the herds mother counts as first and best of all and round her are the seventoned people of the choir
the pious one hath reached your place before the rest one only moves victorious with the rudras band
to these your helpers pour our meath immortal gods with whom your song of praise hath power to win their gifts
he who maintains the laws of god informed me that thou wast lying hidden in the waters
indra who knoweth well beheld and showed thee by him instructed am i come o agni
the stranger asks the way of him who knows it taught by the skilful guide he travels onward
this is in truth the blessing of instruction he finds the path that leads directly forward
even now he breathed these days hath he remembered concealed he sucked the bosom of his mother
yet in his youth old age hath come upon him he hath grown gracious good and free from anger
o kalasa all these blessings will we bring them o kurusravana who give rich presents
may he o wealthy princes and this soma which i am bearing in my heart reward you
the urgings of the people have impelled me and bythe nearest way i bring you pusan
the universal gods have brought me safely the cry was heard behold dubsasu cometh
the ribs that compass me give pain and trouble me like rival wives
indigence nakedness exhaustion press me sore my mind is fluttering like a birds
as rats eat weavers threads cares are consuming me thy singer gatakratu me
have mercy on us once o indra bounteous lord be thou a father unto us
i the priests rsi chose as prince most liberal kurusravana
the son of trasadasyus son
whose three bays harnessed to the car bear me straight onward i will laud
the giver of a thousand meeds
the sire of upamasravas even him whose words were passing sweet
as a fair field is to its lord
mark upamasravas his son mark grandson of mitratithi
i am thy fathers eulogist
if i controlled immortal gods yea even were i lord of men
my liberal prince were living still
none lives even had he hundred lives beyond the statute of the gods
so am i parted from my friend
sprung from tall trees on windy heights these rollers transport me as they turn upon the table
dearer to me the die that never slumbers than the deep draught of mujavans own soma
she never vexed me nor was angry with me but to my friends and me was ever gracious
for the dies sake whose single point is final mine own devoted wife i alienated
my wife holds me aloof her mother hates me the wretched man finds none to give him comfort
as of a costly horse grown old and feeble i find not any profit of the gamester
others caress the wife of him whose riches the die hath coveted that rapid courser
of him speak father mother brothers saying we know him not bind him and take him with you
when i resolve to play with these no longer my friends depart from me and leave me lonely
when the brown dice thrown on the board have rattled like a fond girl i seek the place of meeting
the gamester seeks the gamblinghouse and wonders his body all afire shall i be lucky
still do the dice extend his eager longing staking his gains against his adversary
dice verily are armed with goads and drivinghooks deceiving and tormenting causing grievous woe
they give frail gifts and then destroy the man who wins thickly anointed with the players fairest good
merrily sports their troop the threeandfifty like savitar the god whose ways are faithful
they bend not even to the mightys anger the king himself pays homage and reveres them
downward they roll and then spring quickly upward and handless force the man with hands to serve them
cast on the board like lumps of magic charcoal though cold themselves they burn the heart to ashes
the gamblers wife is left forlorn and wretched the mother mourns the son who wanders homeless
in constant fear in debt and seeking riches he goes by night unto the home of others
sad is the gambler when he sees a matron anothers wife and his wellordered dwelling
he yokes the brown steeds in the early morning and when the fire is cold sinks down an outcast
to the great captain of your mighty army who hath become the hosts imperial leader
to him i show my ten extended fingers i speak the truth no wealth am i withholding
play not with dice no cultivate thy cornland enjoy the gain and deem that wealth sufficient
there are thy cattle there thy wife o gambler so this good savitar himself hath told me
make me your friend show us some little mercy assail us not with your terrific fierceness
appeased be your malignity and anger and let the brown dice snare some other captive

do homage unto varunas and mitras eye offer this solemn worship to the mighty god
who seeth far away the ensign born of gods sing praises unto surya to the son of dyaus
may this my truthful speech guard me on every side wherever heaven and earth and days are spread abroad
all else that is in motion finds a place of rest the waters ever flow and ever mounts the sun
no godless man from time remotest draws thee down when thou art driving forth with winged dappled steeds
one lustre waits upon thee moving to the cast and surya thou arisest with a different light

agni roared out like dyaus what time he thunders he licked the ground about the plants he flickered
at once when born he looked around enkindled and lightened heaven and earth within with splendour

even the firm rock he cleft when passing over when the five tribes brought sacrifice to agni
so among mortals was immortal agni stablished as holy wise and willing envoy

i was the first possessor of all precious gear the wealth of every man i win and gather up
on me as on a father living creatures call i deal enjoyment to tho man who offers gifts
i indra am atharvans stay and firm support i brought forth kine to trita from the dragons grasp
i stripped the dasyus of their manly might and gave the cattlestalls to matarigvan and dadhyac
for me hath tvastar forged the iron thunderbolt in me the gods have centred intellectual power
my sheen is like the suns insufferably bright men honour me as lord for past and future deeds
i won myself these herdi of cattle steeds and kine and gold in ample store with my destructive bolt
i give full many a thousand to the worshipper what time the somas and the lauds have made me glad
indra am i none ever wins my wealth from me never at any time am i a thrall to death
pressing the soma ask riches from me alone ye purus in my friendship shall not suffer harm
these breathing loud in fury two and two who caused indra to bring his bolt of thunder to the fray
the challengers i struck with deadly weapon down firm stand what words the god speaks to his worshippers
this one by stronger might i conquered singly yea also two shall three prevail against me
like many sheaves upon the floor i thrash them how can my foes the indraless revile me
against the gungus i made atithigva strong and kept him mid the folk like vrtraconquering strength
when i won glory in the great foeslaying fight in battle where karanja fell and parnaya
with food for mine enjoyment sapya nami came he joined me as a friend of old in search of kine
as i bestowed on him an arrow for the fight i made him worthy of the song apd hymn of praise
one of the two hath soma seen within it the herdsman with the bone shows forth the other
he fain to fight the bull whose horns were sharpened stood fettered in the demons ample region
i as a god neer violate the statutes of gods of vasus rudriyas adityas
these gods have formed me for auspicious vigour unconquered and invincible for ever
i have enriched the singer with surpassing wealth i have allowed the holy hymn to strengthen me
i furtherer of him who offers sacrifice have conquered in each fight the men who worship not
the people of the heavens the waters and the earth have stablished me among the gods with indras name
i took unto myself the two swift vigorous bays that speed on divers paths and the fierce bolt for strength
with deadly blows i smote atka for kavis sake i guarded kutsa well with these saving helps
as susnas slayer i brandished the dart of death i gave not up the aryan name to dasyu foes
smadibha tugra and the vetasus i gave as prey to kutsa fatherlike to succour him
i was a worthy king to rule the worshipper when i gave tuji dear inviolable gifts
i gave up mrgaya to srutarvan as his prey because he ever followed me and kept my laws
for ayus sake i caused veta to bend and bow and into savyas hand delivered padgrbhi
i crushed navavastva of the lofty car the dasa as the vrtraslayer kills the fiends
when straightway on the regions farthest edge i brought the god who makes the lights to broaden and increase
i travel round about borne onward in my might by the fleetfooted dappled horses of the sun
when mans libation calls me to the robe of state i soon repel the powerful dasyu with my blows
stronger am i than nabus i who slew the seven i glorified with might yadu and turvaga
i brought another low with strength i bent his strength i let the mighty nineandninety wax in power
bull over all the streams that flow along the earth i took the seven rivers as mine own domain
i gifted with great wisdom spread the floods abroad by war i found for man the way to high success
i set within these cows the white milk which no god not even tvastars self had there deposited
muchlongedfor in the breasts the udders of the kine the savoury sweets of meath the milk and soma juice
even thus hath indra maghavan truly bounteous sped gods and men with mighty operation
the pious glorify all these thine exploits lord of bay coursers strong and selfresplendent
i laud your mighty one who joyeth in the juice him who is shared by all men who created all
indra whose conquering strength is powerful in war whose fame and manly vigour heaven and earth revere
he with his friend is active lauded good to man indra who must be glorified by one like me
hero lord of the brave all cars are thy delight warring with vrtra or for waters or for spoil
who are the men whom thou wilt further indra who strive to win thy bliss allied with riches
who urged thee forward to exert thy power divine to valour in the war for waters on their fields
thou indra through the holy prayer art mighty worthy of sacrifice at all libations
in every fight thou castest heroes on the ground thou art the noblest song o lord of all the folk
help now as highest those who toil at sacrifice well do the people know thy great protecting might
thou shalt be everlasing giver of success yea on all these libations thou bestowest strength

therefore thy vessel is to be esteemed the best sacrifice holy text prayer and exalted speech
they who with flowing soma pray to thee o sage to pour on them thy gifts of opulence and wealth
may they come forward through their spirit on the path of bliss in the wild joy of soma juice effused
large was that covering and firm of texture folded wherein thou enteredst the waters
one deity alone o jatavedas agni saw all thy forms in sundry places
what god hath seen me who of all their number clearly beheld my forms in many places
where lie then all the sacred logs of agni that lead him godward varuna and mitra
in many places agni jatavedas we sought thee hidden in the plants and waters
then yama marked thee god of wondrous splendour effulgent from thy tenfold secret dwelling
i fled in fear from sacrificial worship varuna lest the gods should thus engage me
thus were my forms laid down in many places this as my goal i agni saw before me
come man is pious and would fain do worship he waits prepared in gloom thou agni dwellest
make pathways leading godward clear and easy and bear oblations with a kindly spirit
this goal mine elder brothers erst selected as he who drives a car the way to travel
sovaruna i fled afar through terror as flies the wildbull from an archers bowstring
we give thee life unwasting jatavedas so that employed thou never shalt be injured
so nobly born shalt thou with kindly spirit bear to the gods their share of mens oblations
grant me the first oblations and the latter entire my forceful shares of holy presents
the soul of plants the fatness of the waters and let there be long life ye gods to agni
thine be the first oblations and the latter entire thy forceful shares of holy presents
let all this sacrifice be thine o agni and let the worlds four regions how before thee
instruct me all ye gods how i elected your priest must seat me here and how address you
instruct me how to deal to each his portion and by what path to bring you mans oblation
i sit as priest most skilled in sacrificing the maruts and all deities impel me
asvins each day yours is the adhvaryus duty brahman and wood are here tis yours to offer
who is the priest is he the priest of yama on whom is thrust this godappointed honour
he springs to life each month each day that passes so gods have made him their oblationbearer
the gods have made me bearer of oblations who slipped away and passed through many troubles
wise agni shall ordain for us the worship whether fivewayed threefold or seventhreaded
so will i win you strength and life for ever o gods that i may give you room and freedom
to indras arms would i consign the thunder in all these battles shall he then be victor
the deities three hundred and thirtynine have served and honoured agni
strewn sacred grass anointed him with butter and seated him as priest the gods invoker
i sing thy fame that maghavan through thy greatness the heavens and earth invoked thee in their terror
thou aiding gods didst quell the power of dasas what time thou holpest many a race o indra
when thou wast roaming waxen strong in body telling thy might indra among the people
all that men called thy battles was illusion no foe hast thou today nor erst hast found one
who are the rsis then who comprehended before our time the bounds of all thy greatness
for from thy body thou hast generated at the same time the mother and the father
thou mighty steer hast four supremest natures asura natures that may neer be injured
all these o maghavan thou surely knowest wherewith thou hast performed thy great achievements
thou hast all treasures in thy sole possession treasures made manifest and treasures hidden
defer not thou o maghavan my longing thou art director indra thou art giver
to him who set the light in things of splendour and with all sweetness blent essential sweetness
to indra hath this welcome hymn that strengthens been uttered by the votary brhaduktha

the earth and heaven thou settest near each other and maghavan madest bright thy brothers children
great is that secret name and farextending whereby thou madest all that is and shall be
the five tribes whom he loveth well have entered the light he loveth that was made aforetime
he filled the heaven and earth and all between them gods five times sevenfold in their proper seasons
with fourandthirty lights he looks around him lights of one colour though their ways are divers
as first among the lights o dawn thou shonest whereby thou broughtest forth the stay of increase
great art thou matchless is thine asura nature who high above art kin to those beneath thee
the old hath waked the young moon from his slumber who runs his circling course with many round him
behold the gods high wisdom in its greatness he who died yesterday today is living
strong is the red bird in his strength great hero who from of old hath had no nest to dwell in
that which he knows is truth and never idle he wins and gives the wealth desired of many
through these the thunderer gained strong manly vigour through whom he waxed in power to smite down vrtra
who through the might of indras operation came forth as gods in course of law and order
allstrong performing works with his companion allmarking rapid victor curseaverter
the hero waxing after draughts of soma blew far from heaven the dasyus with his weapon
here is one light for thee another yonder enter the third and he therewith united

unswerving stablish as it were in heaven thine own light as the mighty gods supporter
strong steed art thou go to the yearning maidens with vigour happily go to heaven and praises
fly happily to the gods with easy passage according to the first and faithful statutes
part of their grandeur have the fathers also gained the gods have seated mental power in them as gods
they have embraced within themselves all energies which issuing forth again into their bodies pass
they strode through all the region with victorious might establishing the old immeasurable laws
they compassed in their bodies all existing things and streamed forth offipring in many successive forms
in two ways have the sons established in his place the asura who finds the light by the third act
as fathers they have set their heritage on earth their offspring as a thread continuously spun out
as in a ship through billows so through regions of air with blessings through toils and troubles
hath brhaduktha brought his seed with glory and placed it here and in the realms beyond us
let us not indra leave the path the somapressers sacrifice
let no malignity dwell with us

his life hath been renewed and carried forward as two men carborne by the skilful driver
one falls then seeks the goal with quickened vigour let nirrti depart to distant places
here is the psalm for wealth and food in plenty let us do many deeds to bring us glory
all these our doings shall delight the singer let nirrti depart to distant places
may we oercome our foes with acts of valour as heaven is over earth hills over lowlands

bringing our homage we have come to one magnificent in look
glorified of the mighty gods
to asamati spring of gifts lord of the brave a radiant car
the conqueror of bhajeratha
who when the spear hath armed his hand or even weaponless oerthrows
men strong as buffaloes in fight
him in whose service flourishes iksvaku rich and dazzlingbright
as the five tribes that are in heaven
indra support the princely power of rathaprosthas matched by none
even as the sun for all to see
thou for agastyas sisters sons yokest thy pair of ruddy steeds
thou troddest niggards under foot all those o king who brought no gifts
this is the mother this the sire this one hath come to be thy life
what brings thee forth is even this now come subandhu get thee forth
as with the leather thong they bind the chariot yoke to hold it fast
so have i held thy spirit fast held it for life and not for death held it for thy security
even as this earth the mighty earth holds fast the monarchs of the wood
so have i held thy spirit fast held it for life and not for death held it for thy security
subandlins spirit i have brought from yarna from vivasvans son
brought it for life and not for death yea brought it for security
the wind blows downward from on high downward the sungod sends his heat
downward the milchcow pours her milk so downward go thy pain and grief
felicitous is this mine hand yet more felicitous is this
this hand contains all healing balms and this makes whole with gentle touch
may they who would assume kinship from far away vivasvans generations dearly loved of men
even the gods who sit upon the sacred grass of nahusas son yayati bless and comfort us
for worthy of obeisance gods are all your names worthy of adoration and of sacrifice
ye who were born from waters and from aditi and from the earth do ye here listen to my call
i will rejoice in these adityas for my weal for whom the mother pours forth water rich in balm
and dyaus the infinite firm as a rock sweet milkgods active strong through lauds whose might the bull upholds
looking on men neer slumbering they by their deserts attained as gods to lofty immortality
borne on refulgent cars sinless with serpents powers they robe them for our welfare in the height of heaven
great kings who bless us who have come to sacrifice who neer assailed have set their mansion in the sky
these i invite with adoration and with hymns mighty adityas aditi for happiness
who offereth to you the laud that ye accept o ye allgods of manu many as ye are
who mighty ones will prepare for you the sacrifice to bear us over trouble to felicity
ye to whom manu by seven priests with kindled fire offered the first oblation with his heart and soul
vouchsafe us ye adityas sheitcr free from fear and make us good and easy paths to happiness
wise deities who have dominion oer the world ye thinkers over all that moves not and that moves
save us from uncommitted and committed sin preserve us from all sin today for happiness
in battles we invoke indra still swift to hear and all the holy host of heaven who banish grief
agni mitra and varuna that we may gain dyays bhaga maruts prthivi for happiness
mightilysaving earth incomparable heaven the good guide aditi who gives secure defence
the welloared heavenly ship that lets no waters in free from defect will we ascend for happiness

that conquering car o indra that sets forth at dawn that never breaks may we ascend for happiness
vouchsafe us blessing in our paths and desert tracts blessing in waters and in battle for the light
blessing upon the wombs that bring male children forth and blessing o ye maruts for the gain of wealth
the noblest svasti with abundant riches who comes to what is good by distant pathway
may she at home and far away preserve us and dwell with us under the gods protection
thus hatb the thoughtful sage the son of plati praised you o aditi and all adityas
men are made rich by those who are immortal the heavenly folk have been extolled by gaya
may agni indra mitra varuna consent aryaman vayu pusan and sarasvati
adityas maruts visnu soma lofty sky rudra and aditi and brahmanaspati
indra and agni herolords when vrtra fell dwelling together speeding emulously on
and soma blent with oil putting his greatness forth have with their power filled full the mighty firmament
skilled in the law i lift the hymn of praise to these lawstrengtheners unassailed and great in majesty
these in their wondrous bounty send the watery sea may they as kindly friends send gifts to make us great
they with their might have stayed heaven earth and prthivi the lord of light the firmament the lustrous spheres
even as fleetfoot steeds who make their masters glad the princely gods are praised most bountiful to man
bring gifts to mitra and to varuna who lords of all in spirit never fail the worshipper
whose statute shines on high through everlasting law whose places of sure refuge are the heavens and earth
the cow who yielding milk goes her appointed way hither to us as leader of holy rites
speaking aloud to varuna and the worshipper shall with oblation serve vivasvan and the gods
the gods whose tongue is agni dwell in heaven and sit aiders of law reflecting in the seat of law
they propped up heaven and then brought waters with their might got sacrifice and in a body made it fair
born in the oldest time the parents dwelling round are sharers of one mansion in the home of law
bound by their common vow dyaus prthivi stream forth the moisture rich in oil to varuna the steer
parjanya vata mighty senders of the rain indra and vayu varuna mitra aryaman
we call on aditi adityas and the gods those who are on the earth in waters and in heaven
tvastar and vayu those who count as rbhus both celestial hotarpriests and dawn for happiness
winners of wealth we call and wise brhaspati destroyer of our foes and soma indras friend
they generated prayer the cow the horse the plants the forest trees the earth the waters and the hills
these very bounteous gods made the sun mount to heaven and spread the righteous laws of aryas oer the land
o asvins ye delivered bhujyu from distress ye animated syava vadhrmatis son
to vimada ye brought his consort kamadyu and gave his lost visnapu back to visvaka
thunder the lightnings daughter ajaekapad heavens bearer sindhu and the waters of the sea

with holy thoughts and with purandhi may all gods knowing the law immortal manus holy ones
boongivers favourers finders of light and heaven with gracious love accept my songs my prayer my hymn
immortal gods have i vasistha lauded gods set on high above all other beings
may they this day grant us wide space and freedom ye gods preserve us evermore with blessings
this holy hymn sublime and sevenheaded sprung from eternal law our sire discovered
ayasya friend of all men hath engendered the fourth hymn as he sang his laud to indra
thinking aright praising eternal order the sons of dyaus the asura those heroes
angirases holding the rank of sages first honoured sacrifices holy statute
girt by his friends who cried with swanlike voices bursting the stony barriers of the prison
brhaspati spake in thunder to the cattle and uttered praise and song when he had found them
apart from one away from two above him he drave the kine that stood in bonds of falsehood
brhaspati seeking light amid the darkness drave forth the bright cows three he made apparent
when he had cleft the lairs and western castle he cut off three from him who held the waters
brhaspati discovered while he thundered like dyaus the dawn the sun the cow the lightning
as with a hand so with his roaring indra cleft vala through the guardian of the cattle
seeking the milkdraught with sweatshining comrades he stole the panis kine and left him weeping
he with bright faithful friends winners of booty hath rent the milker of the cows asunder
brhaspati with wild boars strong and mighty sweating with heat hath gained a rich possession
they longing for the kine with faithful spirit incited with their hymns the lord of cattle
brhaspati freed the radiant cows with comrades selfyoked averting shame from one another
in our assembly with auspicious praises exalting him who roareth like a lion
maywe in every fight where heroes conquer rejoice in strong brhaspati the victor
when he had won him every sort of booty and gone to heaven and its most lofty mansions
men praised brhaspati the mighty bringing the light within their mouths from sundry places
fulfil the prayer that begs for vital vigour aid in your wonted manner even the humble
let all our foes be turned and driven backward hear this o heaven and earth ye allproducers
indra with mighty strength cleft asunder the head of arbuda the watery monster
slain ahi and set free the seven rivers o heaven and earth with all the gods protect us
like birds who keep their watch plashing in water like the loud voices of the thundering raincloud
like merry streamlets bursting from the mountain thus to brhaspati our hymns have sounded
the son of angirases meeting the cattle as bhaga brought in aryaman among us
as friend of men he decks the wife and husband as for the race brhaspati nerve our coursers
brhaspati having won them from the mountains strewed down like barley out of winnowing baskets
the vigorous wandering cows who aid the pious desired of all of blameless form wellcoloured
as the sun dews with meath the seat of order and casts a flaming meteor down from heaven
so from the rock brhaspati forced the cattle and cleft the earths skin as it were with water
forth from mid air with light he dravc the darkness as the gale blows a lily from the fiver
like the wind grasping at the cloud of vala brhaspati gathered to himself the cattle
brhaspati when he with fiery lightnings cleft through the weapon of reviling vala
consumedhim as tongues cat what teeth have compassed he threw the prisons of the red cows open
that secret name borne by the lowing cattle within the cave brhaspati discovered
and drave himself the bright kine from the mountain like a birds young after the eggs disclosure
he looked around on rockimprisoned sweetness as one who eyes a fish in scanty water
brhaspati cleaving through with varied clamour brought it forth like a bowl from out the timber
he found the light of heaven and fire and morning with lucid rays he forced apart the darkness
as from a joint brhaspati took the marrow of vala as he gloried in his cattle
as trees for foliage robbed by winter vala mourned for the cows brhaspati had taken
he did a deed neer done neer to be equalled whereby the sun and moon ascend alternate
like a dark steed adorned with pearl the fathers have decorated heaven with constellations
they set the light in day in night the darkness brhaspati cleft the rock and found the cattle
this homage have weoffered to the cloud god who thunders out to many in succession
may this brhaspati vouchsafe us fulness of life with kine and horses men and heroes
enjoy o agni this my fuel welcome the oilfilled ladle where we pour libation
rise up for worship of the gods wise agni on the earths height while days are bright with beauty
may he who goes before the gods come hither with steeds whose shapes are varied narasarhsa
may he most godlike speed our offered viands with homage godward on the path of order
men with oblations laud most constant agni and pray him to perform an envoys duty
with lightlyrolling car and best draughthorses bring the gods hither and sit down as hotar
may the delight of gods spread out transversely may it be with us long in length and fragrant
o holy grass divine with friendly spirit bring thou the willing gods whose chief is indra
touch ye the farextending height of heaven or spring apart to suit the wide earths measure
yearning ye doors with those sublime in greatness seize eagerly the heavenly car that cometh
here in this shrine may dawn and night the daughters of heaven the skilful goddesses be seated
in your wide lap auspicious willing ladies may the gods seat them with a willing spirit
up stands the stone high burns the fire enkindled aditis lap contains the friendly natures
ye two chief priests who serve at this our worship may ye more skilled win for us rich possessions
on our wide grass three goddesses be seated for you have we prepared and made it pleasant
may ila she whose foot drops oil the goddess taste manlike sacrifice and wellset presents
since thou god tvastar hast made beauty perfect since hou hast been the angirases companion
willing most wealthy giver of possessions grant us the gods assembly thou who knowest
wellknowing binding with thy cord bring hither lord of the wood the deities assembly
the god prepare and season our oblations may heaven and earth be gracious to my calling
agni bring hither varuna to help us indra from heaven from airs midrealm the maruts
on sacred grass all holy ones be seated and let the immortal gods rejoice in svaha
whenmen brhaspati giving names to objects sent out vaks first and earliest utterances
all that was excellent and spotless treasured within them was disclosed through their affection
where like men cleansing cornflour in a cribble the wise in spirit have created language
friends see and recognize the marks of friendship their speech retains the blessed sign imprinted
with sacrifice the trace of vak they foilowed and found her harbouring within the rsis
they brought her dealt her forth in many places seven singers make her tones resound in concert
one man hath neer seen vak and yet he seeth one man hath hearing but hath never heard her
but to another hath she shown her beauty as a fond welldressed woman to her husband
one man they call a laggard dull in friendship they never urge him on to deeds of valour
he wanders on in profitless illusion the voice he heard yields neither fruitnor blossom
no part in vak hath he who hath abandoned his own dear friend who knows the truth of friendship
even if he hears her still in vain he listens naught knows he of the path of righteous action
unequal in the quickness of their spirit are friends endowed alike with eyes and hearing
some look like tanks that reach the mouth or shoulder others like pools of water fit to bathe in
when friendly brahmans sacrifice together with mental impulse which the heart hath fashioned
they leave one far behind through their attainments and some who count as brahmans wander elsewhere
those men who step not back and move not forward nor brahmans nor preparers of libations
having attained to vak in sinful fashion spin out their thread in ignorance like spinsters
all friends are joyful in the friend who cometh in triumph having conquered in assembly
he is their blameaverter foodprovider prepared is he and fit for deed of vigour
one plies his constant task reciting verses one sings the holy psalm in sakvari measures
one more the brahman tells the lore of being and one lays down the rules of sacrificing
let us with tuneful skill proclaim these generations of the gods
that one may see them when these hymns are chanted in a future age
these brahmanaspati produced with blast and smelting like a smith
existence in an earlier age of gods from nonexistence sprang
existence in the earliest age of gods from nonexistence sprang
thereafter were the regions born this sprang from the productive power
earth sprang from the productive power the regions from the earth were born
daksa was born of aditi and aditi was daksas child
for aditi o daksa she who is thy daughter was brought forth
after her were the blessed gods born sharers of immortal life
when ye o gods in yonder deep closeclasping one another stood
thence as of dancers from your feet a thickening cloud of dust arose
when o ye gods like yatis ye caused all existing things to grow
then ye brought surya forward who was lying hidden in the sea
eight are the sons of adid who from her body sprang to life
with seven she went to meet the gods she cast martanda far away
so with her seven sons aditi went forth to meet the earlier age
she brought martanda thitherward to spring to life and die again
i am prepared to laud with song or worship the noble ones who are in earth and heaven
or coursers who have triumphed in the contest or those who famed have won the prize with glory
their call the call of gods went up to heaven they kissed the ground with gloryseeking spirit
there where the gods look on for happy fortune and like the kindly heavens bestow their bounties
this is the song of those immortal beings who long for treasures in their full perfection
may these completing prayers and sacrifices bestow upon us wealth where naught is wanting
those living men extolled thy deed o indra those who would fain burst through the stall of cattle
fain to milk her who bare but once great lofty whose sons are many and her streams past number
sacivan win to your assistance indra who never bends who overcomes his foemen
rbhuksan maghavan the hymns upholder who rich in food bears mans kind friend the thunder
since he who won of old anew hath triumphed indra hath earned his name of vrtraslaycr
he hath appeared the mighty lord of conquest what we would have him do let him accomplish
the singer o ye waters in vivasvans place shall tell your grandeur forth that is beyond compare
the rivers have come forward triply seven and seven sindhu in might surpasses all the streams that flow
varuna cut the channels for thy forward course o sindhu when thou rannest on to win the race
thou speedest oer precipitous ridges of the earth when thou art lord and leader of these moving floods
his roar is lifted up to heaven above the earth he puts forth endless vigour with a flash of light
like floods of rain that fall in thunder from the cloud so sindhu rushes on bellowing like a bull
like mothers to their calves like milch kine with their milk so sindhu unto thee the roaring rivers run
thou leadest as a warrior king thine armys wings what time thou comest in the van of these swift streams
favour ye this my laud o ganga yamuna o sutudri parusni and sarasvati
with asikni vitasta o marudvrdha o arjikiya with susoma hear my call
first with trstama thou art eager to flow forth with rasa and susartu and with svetya here
with kubha and with these sindhu and mehatnu thou seekest in thy course krumu and gomati
flashing and whitelygleaming in her mightiness she moves along her ample volumes through the realms
most active of the active sindhu unrestrained like to a dappled mare beautiful fair to see
rich in good steeds is sindhu rich in cars and robes rich in gold noblyfashioned rich in ample wealth
blest silamavati and young urnavati invest themselves with raiment rich in store of sweets
sindhu hath yoked her car lightrolling drawn by steeds and with that car shall she win booty in this fight
so have i praised its power mighty and unrestrained of independent glory roaring as it runs
i grasp at you when power and strength begin to dawn bedew ye indra and the maruts heaven and earth
that day and night in every hall of sacrifice may wait on us and bless us when they first spring forth
press the libation out most excellent of all the pressingstone is grasped like a handguided steed
so let it win the valour that subdues the foe and the fleet coursers might that speeds to ample wealth
juice that this stone pours out removes defect of ours as in old time it brought prosperity to man
at sacrifices they established holy rites on tvastars milkblent juice bright with the hue of steeds
drive ye the treacherous demons far away from us keep nirrti afar and banish penury
pour riches forth for us with troops of hero sons and bear ye up o stones the song that visits gods
to you who are more mighty than the heavens themselves who finishing your task with more than vibhvans speed
more rapidly than vayu seize the soma juice better than agni give us food to you i sing
stirred be the glorious stones let it press out the juice the stone with heavenly song that reaches up to heaven
there where the men draw forth the meath for which they long sending their voice around in rivalry of speed
the stones press out the soma swift as carborne men and eager for the spoil drain forth the sap thereof
to fill the beaker they exhaust the udders store as the men purify oblations with their lips
ye present men have been most skilful in your work even ye o stones who pressed soma for indras drink
may all ye have of fair go to the heavenly race and all your treasure to the earthly worshipper
as with their voice from cloud they sprinkle treasure so are the wise mans liberal sacrifices
i praise their company that merits worship as the good martits priest to pay them honour
the youths have wrought their ornaments for glory through many nightsthis noble band of maruts
like stags the sons of dyatis have striven onward the sons of aditi grown strong like pillars
they who extend beyond the earth and heaven by their own mass as from the cloud spreads surya
like mighty heroes covetous of glory like heavenly gallants who destroy the wicked
when ye come nigh as in the depth of waters the earth is loosened as it were and shaken
this your allfeedin sacrifice approaches come all united fraught as twere with viands
ye are like horses fastened to the chariot poles luminous with your beams with splendour as at dawn
like selfbright falcons punishers of wicked men like hovering birds urged forward scattering rain around
when ye come forth o maruts from the distance from the great treasury of rich possessions
knowing o vasus boons that should be granted even from afar drive back the men who hate us
he who engaged in the rites final duty brings as a man oblation to the maruts
wins him lifes wealthy fulness blest with heroes he shall be present too where gods drink soma

like fire with flashing flame breastbound with chains of gold like tempestblasts selfmoving swift to lend your aid
as best of all foreknowers excellent to guide like somas good to guard the man who follows law
shakers of all like gales of wind they travel like tongues of burning fires in their effulgence
mighty are they as warriors clad in armour and like the fathers prayers most bounteous givers
like spokes of carwheels in one nave united ever victorious like heavenly heroes
shedding their precious balm like youthful suitors they raise their voice and chant their psalm as singers
they who are fleet to travel like the noblest steeds long to obtain the prize like bounteous charioteers
like waters speeding on with their precipitous floods like omniform angirases with samahymns
born from the stream like pressstones are the princes for ever like the stones that crush in pieces
sons of a beauteous dame like playful children like a great host upon the march with splendour
like rays of dawn the visitors of sacrifice they shine with ornaments as eager to be bright
like rivers hasting on glittering with their spears from far away they measure out the distances
gods send us happiness and make us wealthy letting us singers prosper o ye maruts
bethink you of our praise and of our friendship ye from of old have riches to vouchsafe us
i have beheld the might of this great being immortal in the midst of tribes of mortals
his jaws now open and now shut together much they devour insatiately chewing
his eyes are turned away his head is hidden unsated with his tongue he eats the fuel
with hands upraised with reverence in the houses for him they quickly bring his food together
seeking as twere his mothers secret bosom he like a child creeps on through widespread bushes
one he finds glowing like hot food made ready and kissing deep within the earths recmes
this holy law i tell you earth and heaven the infant at his birth dovours his parents
no knowledge of the god have i a mortal yea agni knoweth best for he hath wisdom
this man who quickly gives him food who offers his gifts of oil and butter and supports him
him with his thousand eyes he closely looks on thou showest him thy face from all sides agni
agni hast thou committed sin or treason among the gods in ignorance i ask thee
playing not playing he goldhued and toothless hath cut his food up as the knife a victim
he born in wood hath yoked his horses rushing in all directions held with reins that glitter
the wellborn friend hath carved his food with vasus in all his limbs he hath increased and prospered
agni bestows the fleet prizewinning courser agni the hero famed and firm in duty
agni pervades and decks the earth and heaven and fills the fruitful dame who teems with heroes
blest be the wood that feeds the active agni within the two great worlds hath agni entered
agni impels a single man to battle and with him rends in pieces many a foeman
agni rejoiced the car of him who praised lim and from the waters burnt away jarutha
agni saved atri in the fiery cavem and made nrmedha rich with troops of children
agni hath granted wealth that decks the hero and sent the sage who wins a thousand cattle
agni hath made oblations rise to heaven to every place are agnis laws extended
with songs of praise the rsis call on agni on agni heroes worsted in the foray
birds flying in the region call on agni around a thousand cattle agni wanders
races of human birth pay agni worship men who have sprung from nahus line adore him
stablished in holy oil is agnis pasture on the gandharva path of law and order
the rbhus fabricated prayer for agni and we with mighty hymns have called on agni
agni most youthful god protect the singer win us by worship agni great possessions
he who sate down as hotarpriest the rsi our father offering up all things existing
he seeking through his wish a great possession came among men on earth as archetypal
what was the place whereon he took his station what was it that supported him how was it
whence visvakarman seeing all producing the earth with mighty power disclosed the heavens
he who hath eyes on all sides round about him a mouth on all sides arms and feet on all sides
he the sole god producing earth and heaven weldeth them with his arms as wings together
what was the tree what wood in sooth produced it from which they fashioned out the earth and heaven
ye thoughtful men inquire within your spirit whereon he stood when he established all things
nine highest lowest sacrificial natures and these thy midmost here o visvakarman
teach thou thy friends at sacrifice o blessed and come thyself exalted to our worship
bring thou thyself exalted with oblation o visvakarman earth and heaven to worship
let other men around us live in folly here let us have a rich and liberal patron
let us invoke today to aid our labour the lord of speech the thoughtswift visvakarman
may he hear kindly all our invocations who gives all bliss for aid whose works are righteous
the father of the eye the wise in spirit created both these worlds submerged in fatness
then when the eastern ends were firmly fastened the heavens and the earth were far extended
mighty in mind and power is visvakarman maker disposer and most lofty presence
their offerings joy in rich juice where they value one only one beyond the seven rsis
father who made us he who as disposer knoweth all races and all things existing
even he alone the deities narnegiverhim other beings seek for information
to him in sacrifice they offered treasuresrsis of old in numerous troops as singers
who in the distant near and lower region made ready all these things that have existence
that which is earlier than this earth and heaven before the asuras and gods had being
what was the germ primeval which the waters received where all the gods were seen together
the waters they received that germ primeval wherein the gods were gathefed all together
it rested set upon the unborns navel that one wherein abide all things existing
ye will not find him who produced these creatures another thing hath risen up among you

enkindled sharpened by our rites may agni protect us in the day and night from evil
o jatavedas with the teeth of iron enkindled with thy flame attack the demons

apply thy teeth the upper and the lower thou who hast both enkindled and destroying
roam also in the air o king around us and with thy jaws assail the wicked spirits
bending thy shafts through sacrifices agni whetting their points with song as if with whetstones
pierce to the heart therewith the yatudhanas and break their arms uplifed to attack thee
pierce through the yatudhanas skin o agni let the destroying dart with fire consume him
rend his joints jatavedas let the cater of flesh fleshseeking track his mangled body
where now thou seest agni jatavedas one of these demons standing still or roaming
or flying on those paths in airs midregion sharpen the shaft and as an archer pierce him
tear from the evil spirit jatavedas what he hath seized and with his spears hath captured
blazing before him strike him down o agni let spotted carrioneating kites devour him
here tell this forth o agni whosoever is he himself or acteth as a demon

thrice agni let thy noose surround the demon who with his falsehood injures holy order
loud roaring with thy flame o jatavedas crush him and cast him down before the singer
lead thou the worshipper that eye o agni wherewith thou lookest on the hoofarmed demon

destroy with fire the foolish gods adorers blaze and destrepy the insatiable monsters
may gods destroy this day the evildoer may each hot curse of his return and blast him
let arrows pierce the liar in his vitals and visvas net enclose the yatudhana

who steals the milchcows milk away o agnitear off the heads of such with fiery fury

if one would glut him with the biesting agni pierce with thy flame his vitals as he meets thee

break thou the yatudhanas strength the vigour of the raksasa
dear ageless sacrificial drink is offered in lightdiscovering heavenpervading agni
the gods spread forth through his celestial nature that he might bear the world up and sustain it
the world was swallowed and concealed in darkness agni was born and light became apparent
the deities the broad earth and the heavens and plants and waters gloried in his friendship
inspired by gods who claim our adoration i now will laud eternal lofty agni
him who hath spread abroad the earth with lustre this heaven and both the worlds and airs midregion
earliest priest whom all the gods accepted and chose him and anointed him with butter
he swiftly made all things that fly stand travel all that hath motion agni jatavedas
because thou agni jatavedas stoodest at the worlds head with thy refulgent splendour
we sent thee forth with hymns and songs and praises thou filledst heaven and earth god meet for worship
head of the world is agni in the nighttime then as the sun at morn springs up and rises
then to his task goes the prompt priest foreknowing the wondrous power of gods who must be honoured
lovely is he who kindled in his greatness hath shone forth seated in the heavens refulgent
with resonant hymns all gods who guard our bodies have offered up oblation in this agni
first the gods brought the hymnal into being then they engendered agni then oblation
he was their sacrifice that guards our bodies him the heavens know the earth the waters know him
he agni whom the gods have generated in whom they offered up all worlds and creatures
he with his bright glow heated earth and heaven urging himself right onward in his grandeur
then by the laud the gods engendered agni in heaven who fills both worlds through strength and vigour
they made him to appear in threefold essence he ripens plants of every form and nature
what time the gods whose due is worship set him as surya son of aditi in heaven
when the pair ever wandering sprang to being all creatures that existed looked upon them
for all the world of life the gods made agni vaisvanara to be the days bright banner
him who hath spread abroad the radiant mornings and coming with his light unveils the darkness
the wise and holy deities engendered agni vaisvanara whom age neer touches
the ancient star that wanders on for ever lofty and strong lord of the living being
we call upon the sage with holy verses agni vaisvanara the everbeaming
who hath surpassed both heaven and earth in greatness he is a god below a god above us
i have heard mention of two several pathways ways of the fathers and of gods and mortals
on these two paths each moving creature travels each thing between the father and the mother
these two united paths bear him who journeys born from the head and pondered with the spirit
he stands directed to all things existing hasting unresting in his fiery splendour
which of us twain knows where they speak together upper and lower of the two riteleaders
our friends have helped to gather our assembly they came to sacrifice who will announce it
how many are the fires and suns in number what is the number of the dawns and waters
not jestingly i speak to you o fathers sages i ask you this for information
as great as is the fairwinged mornings presence to him who dwells beside us matarisvan
is what the brahman does when he approaches to sacrifice and sits below the hotar
a thousand heads hath purusa a thousand eyes a thousand feet
on every side pervading earth he fills a space ten fingers wide
this purusa is all that yet hath been and all that is to be
the lord of immortality which waxes greater still by food
so mighty is his greatness yea greater than this is purusa
all creatures are onefourth of him threefourths eternal life in heaven
with threefourths purusa went up onefourth of him again was here
thence he strode out to every side over what cats not and what cats
from him viraj was born again purusa from viraj was born
as soon as he was born he spread eastward and westward oer the earth
when gods prepared the sacrifice with purusa as their offering
its oil was spring the holy gift was autumn summer was the wood
they balmed as victim on the grass purusa born in earliest time
with him the deities and all sadhyas and rsis sacrificed
from that great general sacrifice the dripping fat was gathered up
he formed the creatures ofthe air and animals both wild and tame
from that great general sacrifice rcas and samahymns were born
therefrom were spells and charms produced the yajus had its birth from it
from it were horses born from it all cattle with two rows of teeth
from it were generated kine from it the goats and sheep were born
when they divided purusa how many portions did they make
what do they call his mouth his arms what do they call his thighs and feet
the brahman was his mouth of both his arms was the rajanya made
his thighs became the vaisya from his feet the sudra was produced
the moon was gendered from his mind and from his eye the sun had birth
indra and agni from his mouth were born and vayu from his breath
forth from his navel came midair the sky was fashioned from his head
earth from his feet and from his car the regions thus they formed the worlds
seven fencingsticks had he thrice seven layers of fuel were prepared
when the gods offering sacrifice bound as their victim purusa
gods sacrificing sacrificed the victim these were the earliest holy ordinances
the mighty ones attained the height of heaven there where the sadhyas gods of old are dwelling
brisk at the place of ila hymned by men who wake our own familiar friend is kindled in the house
hotar of all oblation worthy of our choice lord beaming trusty friend to one who loveth him
he excellent in glory guest in every house finds like a swiftwinged bird a home in every tree
benevolent to men he scorns no living man friend to the tribes of men he dwells with every tribe
most sage with insight passing skilful with thy powers art thou o agni wise with wisdom knowing all
as vasu thou alone art lord of all good things of all the treasures that the heavens and earth produce
foreknowing well o agni thou in ilas place hast occupied thy regular station balmed with oil
marked are thy comings like the comings of the dawns the rays of him who shineth spotless as the sun
thy glories are as lightnings from the rainy cloud marked manyhued like heralds of the dawns approach
when loosed to wander over plants and forest trees thou crammest by thyself thy food into thy mouth
him duly coming as their germ have plants received this agni have maternal waters brought to life
so in like manner do the forest trees and plants bear him within them and produce him evermore
when sped and urged by wind thou spreadest thee abroad swift piercing through thy food according to thy will
thy neverceasing blazes longing to consume like men on chariots agni strive on every side
agni the hotarpriest who fills the assembly full waker of knowledge chief controller of the thought
him yea none other than thyself doth man elect at sacrificial offerings great and small alike
here agni the arrangers those attached to thee elect thee as their priest in sacred gatherings
when men with strewn clipt grass and sacrificial gifts offer thee entertainment piously inclined
thine is the heralds task and cleansers duly timed leader art thou and kindler for the pious man
thou art director thou the ministering priest thou art the brahman lord and master in our home
when mortal man presents to thee immortal god agni his fuel or his sacrificial gift
then thou art his adhvaryu hotar messenger callest the gods and orderest the sacrifice
from us these hymns in concert have gone forth to him these holy words these rcas songs and eulogies
eager for wealth to jatavedas fain for wealth when they have waxen strong they please their strengthener
this newest eulogy will i speak forth to him the ancient one who loves it may he hear our voice
may it come near his heart and make it stir with love as a fond welldressed matron clings about her lord
he in whom horses bulls oxen and barren cows and rams when duly set apart are offered up
to agni somasprinkled drinker of sweet juice disposer with my heart i bring a fair hymn forth
into thy mouth is poured the offering agni as soma into cup oil into ladle
vouchsafe us wealth strengthwinning blest with heroes wealth lofty praised by men and full of splendour
i praise your charioteer of sacrifice the lord of men priest of the tribes refulgent guest of night
blazing amid dry plants snatching amid the green the strong the holy herald hath attained to heaven
him agni gods and men have made their chief support who drinks the fatness and completes the sacrifice
with kisses they caress the grandson of the red like the swift ray of light the household priest of dawn
yea we discriminate his and the niggards ways his branches evermore are sent forth to consume
when his terrific flames have reached the immortals world then men remember and extol the heavenly folk
for then the net of law dyaus and the wide expanse earth worship and devotion meet for highest praise
varuna indra mitra were of one accord and savitar and bhaga lords of holy might

and may he too give car the sage from far away the dragon of the deep to this our yearning call

dear to all gods may pusan guard the ways we go the waters child and vayu help us to success

with hymns of praise we sing him who is throned as lord over these fearless tribes the selfresplendent one
we praise nights youthful lord benevolent to men the foeless one the free with all celestial dames
by reason of his birth here angiras first sang the pressingstones upraised beheld the sacrifice

this speaker indrafor thou art our friendwherever he may be guard thou victor for help ever for help

so have they strengthened this mine hymn which seems to take its bright path to the sun and reconciles the men
thus forms a carpenter the yoke of horses not to be displaced
whose chariotseat hath come again laden with wealth and bright with gold
lightly with piercing ends as twere two ranks of heroes ranged for fight
this to duhsima prthavana have i sung to vena rama to the nobles and the king
they yoked five hundred and their love of us was famed upon their way
besides they showed us sevenandseventy horses here
tanva at once displayed his gift parthya at once displayed his gift and straightway mayava showed his
let these speak loudly forth let us speak out aloud to the loud speaking pressingstones address the speech
when rich with soma juice stones of the mountain ye united swift to indra bring the sound of praise
they speak out like a hundred like a thousand men they cry aloud to us with their greentinted mouths
while pious stones they ply their task with piety and even before the hotar taste the offered food
loudly they speak for they have found the savoury meath they make a humming sound over the meat prepared
as they devour the branch of the redcoloured tree these the wellpastured bulls have uttered bellowings
they cry aloud with strong exhilarating drink calling on indra now for they have found the meath
bold with the sisters they have danced embraced by them making the earth reecho with their ringing sound
the eagles have sent forth their cry aloft in heaven in the skys vault the dark impetuous ones have danced
then downward to the nether stones fixt place they sink and splendid as the sun effuse their copious stream
like strong ones drawing they have put forth all their strength the bulls harnessed together bear the chariotpoles
when they have bellowed panting swallowing their food the sound of their loud snorting is like that of steeds
to these who have ten workers and a tenfold girth to these who have ten yokestraps and ten binding thongs
to these who bear ten reins the eternal sing ye praise to these who bear ten carpoles ten when they are yoked
these stones with ten conductors rapid in their course with lovely revolution travel round and round
they have been first to drink the flowing soma juice first to enjoy the milky fluid of the stalk
these somaeaters kiss indras baycoloured steeds draining the stalk they sit upon the oxs hide
indra when he hath drunk somameath drawn by them waxes in strength is famed is mighty as a bull
strong is your stalk ye verily never shall be harmed ye have refreshment ye are ever satisfied
fair are ye as it were through splendour of his wealth his in whose sacrifice o stones ye find delight
bored deep but not pierced through with holes are ye o stones not loosened never weary and exempt from death
eternal undiseased moving in sundry ways unthirsting full of fatness void of all desire
your fathers verily stand firm from age to age they loving rest are not dissevered from their seat
untouched by time neer lacking green plants and green trees they with their voice have caused the heavens and earth to hear
this this the stones proclaim what time they are disjoined and when with ringing sounds they move and drink the balm
like tillers of the ground when they are sowing seed they mix the soma nor devouring minish it
they have raised high their voice for juice for sacrifice striking the mother earth as though they danced thereon
so loose thou too his thought who hath effused the sap and let the stones which we are honouring be disjoined
ho there my consort stay thou fiercesouled lady and let us reason for a while together
such thoughts as these of ours while yet unspoken in days gone by have never brought us comfort
what am i now to do with this thy saying i have gone from thee like the first of mornings
pururavas return thou to thy dwelling i like the wind am difficult to capture
like a shaft sent for glory from the quiver or swiftsteed winning cattle winning hundreds
the lightning seemed to flash as cowards planned it the minstrels bleated like a lamb in trouble
giving her husbands father life and riches from the near dwelling when her lover craved her
she sought the home wherein she found her pleasure accepting day and night her lords embraces
thrice in the day didst thou embrace thy consort though coldly she received thy fond caresses
to thy desires pururavas i yielded so wast thou king o hero of my body
the maids sujirni sreni sumneapi charanyu granthini and hradecaksus
these like red kine have hastened forth the bright ones and like milchcows have lowed in emulation
while he was born the dames sate down together the rivers with free kindness gave him nurture
and then pururavas the gods increased thee for mighty battle to destroy the dasyus
when i a mortal wooed to mine embraces these heavenly nymphs who laid aside their raiment
like a scared snake they fled from me in terror like chariot horses when the car has touched them
when loving these immortal ones the mortal hath converse with the nymphs as they allow him
like swans they show the beauty of their bodies like horses in their play they bite and nibble
she who flashed brilliant as the falling lightning brought me delicious presents from the waters
now from the flood be born a strong young hero may uruvasi prolong her life for ever
thy birth hath made me drink from earthly milchkine this power pururavas hast thou vouchsafed me
i knew and warned thee on that day thou wouldst not hear me what sayest thou when naught avails thee
when will the son be born and seek his father mournerlike will he weep when first he knows him
who shall divide the accordant wife and husband while fire is shining with thy consorts parents
i will console him when his tears are falling he shall not weep and cry for care that blesses
that which is thine between us will i send thee go home again thou foolthou hast not won me
thy lover shall flee forth this day for ever to seek without return the farthest distance
then let his bed be in destructions bosom and there let fierce rapacious wolves devour him
nay do not die pururavas nor vanish let not the evilomened wolves devour thee
with women there can be no lasting friendship hearts of hyenas are the hearts of women
when amid men in altered shape i sojourned and through four autumns spent the nights among them
i tasted once a day a drop of butter and even now with that am i am contented
i her best love call urvasi to meet me her who fills air and measures out the region
let the gift brought by piety approach thee turn thou to me again my heart is troubled
thus speak these gods to thee o son of ila as death hath verily got thee for his subject
thy sons shall serve the gods with their oblation and thou moreover shalt rejoice in svarga

lord of the dwelling he subdued the demon who roared aloud sixeyed and tripleheaded
trta made stronger by the might he lent him struck down the boar with shaft whose point was iron
he raised himself on high and shot his arrow against the guileful and oppressive foeman
strong glorious manliest for us he shattered the forts of nabus when he slew the dasyus

the charioteer in fight was mudgalani she indras dart heaped up the prize of battle
o indra cast thy bolt among assailants who would slaughter us
the weapon both of dasa and of arya foe keep far away o maghavan
the bull in joy had drunk a lake of water his shattering horn encountered an opponent
swiftly in vigorous strength eager for glory he stretched his forefeet fain to win and triumph
they came anear the bull they made him thunder made him pour rain down ere the fight was ended
and mudgala thereby won in the contest wellpastured kine in hundreds and in thousands
in hope of victory that bull was harnessed kesi the driver urged him on with shouting
as he ran swiftly with the car behind him his lifted heels pressed close on mudgalani
deftly for him he stretched the carpole forward guided the bull thereto and firmly yoked him
indra vouchsafed the lord of cows his favour with mighty steps the buffalo ran onward
touched by the goad the shaggy beast went nobly bound to the pole by the yokes thong of leather
performing deeds of might for many people he looking on the cows gained strength and vigour
here look upon this mace this bulls companion now lying midway on the field of battle
therewith hath mudgala in ordered contest won for cattle for himself a hundred thousand
far is the evil who hath here beheld it hither they bring the bull whom they are yoking
to this they give not either food or water reaching beyond the pole it gives directions
like one forsaken she hath found a husband and teemed as if her breast were full and flowing
with swiftlyracing chariot may we conquer and rich and blessed be our gains in battle
thou indra art the mark whereon the eyes of all life rest when thou

exceeding mighty be your arms that none may wound or injure you
when vasu wilt thou love the laud now let the channel bring the stream
the juice is ready to ferment
he whose two bay steeds harnessed well swerving pursue the birds tailplumes
with rowing manes like heaven and earth he is the lord with power to give
bereft of skill is indra if like some outwearied man he fears
the sinner when the mighty hath prepared himself for victory
indra with these drives round until he meets with one to worship him
indra is master of the pair who snort and swerve upon their way
borne onward by the longmaned steeds who stretch themselves as twere for food
the god who wears the helm defends them with his jaws
the mighty sang with lofty ones the hero fashioned with his strength
like skilful matarisvan with his power and might
the bolt which pierced at once the vitals of the dasyu easy to be slain
with jaw uninjured like the wondrous firmament
grind off our sins with song will we conquer the men who sing no hymns
not easily art thou pleased with prayerless sacrifice
when threefold flame burns high for thee to rest on poles of sacrifice

thy glory was the speckled cup thy glory was the flawless scoop
wherewith thou pourest into thy receptacle
as hundreds o immortal god have sung to thee so hath sumitra yea durmitra praised thee here
what time thou holpest kutsas son when dasyus fell yea holpest kutsas darling when the dasyus died
these mens great bounty hath been manifested and the whole world of life set free from darkness
great light hath come vouchsafed us by the fathers apparent is the spacious path of guerdon
high up in heaven abide the guerdongivers they who give steeds dwell with the sun for ever
they who give gold are blest with life eternal they who give robes prolong their lives o soma
not from the niggardsfor they give not fireelycomes meed at sacrifice gods satisfaction
yea many men with hands stretched out with guerdon present their gifts because they dread dishonour
these who observe mankind regard oblation as streamy vayu and lightfinding arka
they satisfy and give their gifts in synod and pour in streams the sevenmothered guerdon
he who brings guerdon comes as first invited chief of the hamlet comes the guerdonbearer
him i account the ruler of the people who was the first to introduce the guerdon
they call him rsi brahman samachanter reciter of the laud leader of worship
the brightlyshining gods three forms he knoweth who first bestowed the sacrificial guerdon
guerdon bestows the horse bestows the bullock guerdon bestows moreover gold that rsisters
guerdon gives food which is our life and spirit he who is wise takes guerdon for his armour
the liberal die not never are they ruined the liberal suffer neither harm nor trouble
the light of heaven the universe about usall this doth sacrificial guerdon give them
first have the liberal gained a fragrant dwelling and got themselves a bride in fair apparel
the liberal have obtained their draught of liquor and conquered those who unprovoked assailed them
they deck the fleet steed for the bounteous giver the maid adorns herself and waits to meet him
his home is like a lake with lotus blossoms like the gods palaces adorned and splendid
steeds good at draught convey the liberal giver and lightly rolling moves the car of guerdon
assist ye gods the liberal man in battles the liberal giver conquers foes in combat
what wish of sarama hath brought her hither the path leads far away to distant places
what charge hast thou for us where turns thy journey how hast thou made thy way oer rasas waters
i come appointed messenger of indra seeking your ample stores of wealth o panis
this hath preserved me from the fear of crossing thus have i made my way oer rasas waters
what is that indra like what is his aspect whose envoy sarama from afar thou comest
let him approach and we will show him friendship he shall be made the herdsman of our cattle
i know him safe from harm but he can punish who sent me hither from afar as envoy
him rivers flowing with deep waters bide not low will ye be o panis slain by indra
these are the kine which sarama thou seekest flying o blest one to the ends of heaven
who will loose these for thee without a battle yea and sharppointed are our warlike weapons
even if your wicked bodies o ye panis were arrowproof your words are weak for wounding
and were the path to you as yet unmastered brhaspati in neither case will spare you
paved with the rock is this our treasurechamber filled full of precious things of kine and horses
these panis who are watchful keepers guard it in vain hast thou approached this lonely station
rsis will come inspirited with soma angirases unwearied and navagvas
this stall of cattle will they part among them then will the panis wish these words unspoken
even thus o sarama hast thou come hither forced by celestial might to make the journey
turn thee not back for thou shalt be our sister o blest one we will give thee of the cattle
brotherhood sisterhood i know not either the dread angirases and indra know them
they seemed to long for kine when i departed hence into distance be ye gone o panis
hence far away ye panis let the cattle lowing come forth as holy law commandeth
kine which brhaspati and soma rsis sages and pressingstones have found when hidden
these first the boundless sea and matarisvan fierceglowing fire the strong the blissbestower
and heavenly floods firstborn by holy order exclaimed against the outrage on a brahman
king soma first of all without reluctance made restitution of the brahmans consort
mitra and varuna were the inviters agni as hota took her hand and led her
the man her pledge must by her hand be taken when they have cried she is a brahmans consort
she stayed not for a herald to conduct her thus is the kingdom of a ruler guarded
thus spake of her those gods of old seven rsis who sate them down to their austere devotion
dire is a brahmans wife led home by others in the supremest heaven she plants confusion
the brahmacari goes engaged in duty he is a member of the gods own body
through him brhaspati obtained his consort as the gods gained the ladle brought by soma
so then the gods restored her so men gave the woman back again
the kings who kept their promises restored the brahmans wedded wife
having restored the brahmans wife and freed them with gods aid from sin
they shared the fulness of the earth and won themselves extended sway
thou in the house of man this day enkindled worshippest gods as god o jatavedas
observant bright as mitra bring them hither thou art a sapient and foreknowing envoy
tanunapat fairtongued with sweet meath balming the paths and waysof order make them pleasant
convey our sacrifice to heaven exalting with holy thoughts ourhymns of praise and worship
invoked deserving prayer and adoration o agni come accordant with the vasus
thou art o youthful lord the gods invoker so best of sacrificers bring them quickly
by rule the sacred grass is scattered eastward a robe to clothe this earth when dawns are breaking
widely it spreads around and farextended fair for the gods and bringing peace and freedom
let the expansive doors be widely opened like wives who deck their beauty for their husbands
lofty celestial allimpelling portals admit the gods and give them easy entrance
pouring sweet dews let holy night and morning each close to each he seated at their station
lofty celestial dames with gold to deck them assuming all their fair and radiant beauty
come the two first celestial sweetvoiced hotars arranging sacrifice for man to worship
as singers who inspire us in assemblies showing the eastward light with their direction
let bharati come quickly to our worship and ila showing like a human being
so let sarasvati and both her fellows deft goddesses on this fair grass be seated
hotar more skilled in sacrifice bring hither with speed today god tvastar thou who knowest
even him who formed these two the earth and heaven the parents with their forms and every creature
send to our offerings which thyself thou balmest the companies of gods in ordered season
agni vanaspati the immolator sweeten our offered gift with meath and butter
agni as soon as he was born made ready the sacrifice and was the gods preceder
may the gods cat our offering consecrated according to this true priests voice and guidance
bring forth your sacred song ye prudent singers even as are the thoughts of human beings
let us draw indra with true deeds anear us he loves our songs the hero and is potent
the hymn shone brightly from the seat of worship to the kine came the bull the heifers offipring
with mighty bellowing hath he arisen and hath pervaded even the spacious regions
indra knows verily how to hear our singing for he victorious made a path for surya
he made the cow and be became the sovran of heaven primeval matchless and unshaken
praised by angirases indra demolished with might the works of the great watery monster
full many regions too hath he pervaded and by his truth supported earths foundation
the counterpart of heaven and earth is indra he knoweth all libations slayeth susna
the vast sky with the sun hath he extended and best otpillars stayed it with a pillar
the vrtraslaver with his bolt felled vrtra the magic of the godless waxen mighty
here hast thou bold assailant boldly conquered yea then thine arms o maghavan were potent
when the dawns come attendant upon surya their rays discover wealth of divers colours
the star of heaven is seen as twere approaching none knoweth aught of it as it departeth
far have they gone the first of all these waters the waters that flowed forth when indra sent them
where is their spring and where is their foundation where now ye waters is your inmost centre
thou didst free rivers swallowed by the dragon and rapidly they set themselves in motion
those that were loosed and those that longed for freedom excited now to speed they run unresting
yearning together they have sped to sindhu the fortdestroyer praised of old hath loved them
indra may thy terrestrial treasures reach us and our full songs of joy approach thy dwelling
drink of the juice o indra at thy plea sure for thy first draught is early morns libation
rejoice that thou mayst slay our foes o hero and we with lauds will tell thy mighty exploits
thou hast a car more swift than thought o indra thercon come hither come to drink the soma
let thy bay steeds thy stallions hasten hither with whom thou cornest nigh and art delighted
deck out thy body with the fairest colours with golden splendour of the sun adorn it
o indra turn thee hitherward invited by us thy friends be seated and be joyful
o thou whose grandeur in thy festive transports not even these two great worlds have comprehended
come indra with thy dear bay horses harnessed come to our dwelling and the food thou lovest
pressed for thy joyous banquet is the soma soma whereof thou indra ever drinking
hast waged unequalled battles with thy foemen which prompts the mighty flow of thine abundance
found from of old is this thy cup o indra satakratu drink therefrom the soma
filled is the beaker with the meath that gladdens the beaker which all deities delight in
from many a side with proffered entertainment the folk are calling thee o mighty indra
these our libations shall for thee be richest in sweet meath dvink thereof and find them pleasant
i will declare thy deeds of old o indra the mighty acts which thou hast first accomplished
in genuine wrath thou loosenedst the mountain so that the brahman easily found the cattle
lord of the hosts amid our bands be seated they call thee greatest sage among the sages
nothing is done even far away without thee great wondrous maghavan is the hymn i sing thee
aim of our eyes be thou for we implore thee o maghavan friend of friends and lord of treasures
fight warrior strong in truth fight thou the battle give us our share of undivided riches
the heavens and the earth accordant with all gods encouraged graciously that vigorous might of his
when he came showing forth his majesty and power he drank of soma juice and waxed exceeding strong
this majesty of his visnu extols and lauds making the stalcthat gives the meath flow forth with inight
when indra maghavan with those who followed him had smitten vrtra he deserved the choice of gods
when bearing warlike weapons fain to win thee praise thou mettest vrtra yea the dragon for the fight
then all the maruts who were gathered with dice there extolled o mighty one thy powerful majesty
soon as he sprang to life he forced asun der hosts forward the hero looked to manly deed and war
he cleft the rock he let concurrent streams flow forth and with his skilful art stablished the heavens wide vault
indra hath evermore possessed surpassing power he forced far from each other heaven and earth apart
he hurled impetuous down his iron thunderbolt a joy to varunas and mitras worshipper
then to the mighty powers of indra to his wrath his the fierce stormer loud of voice they came with speed
what time the potent one rent vrtra with his strength who held the waters back whom darkness compassed round
even in the first of those heroic acts which they who strove together came with might to execute
deep darkness fell upon the slain and indra won by victory the right of being first invoked
then all the gods extolled with eloquence inspired by draughts of soma juice thy deeds of manly might
as agni eats the dry food with his tcetlv he ate vrtra the dragon maimed by indras deadly dart
proclaim his many friendships met with friendship made with singers with the skilful and the eloquent
indra when he subdues dhuni and cumuri lists to dabhiti for his faithful spirits sake
give riches manifold with noble horses to be remembered while my songs address thee
may we by easy paths pass all our troubles find us this day a ford wide and extensive
two perfect springs of heat pervade the threefold and come for their delight is matarisvan
craving the milk of heaven the gods are present well do they know the praisesong and the saman
the priests beard far away as they are ordered serve the three nirrtis for well they know them
sages have traced the cause that first produced them dwelling in distant and mysterious chambers
the youthful one wellshaped with four locks braided brightened with oil puts on the ordinances
two birds of mighty power are seated near her there where the deities receive their portion
one of these birds hath passed into the sea of air thence he looks round and views this universal world
with simple heart i have beheld him from anear his mother kisses him and he returns her kiss
him with fair wings though only one in nature wise singers shape with songs in many figures
while they at sacrifices fix the metres they measure out twelve chalices of soma
while they arrange the four and sixandthirty and duly order up to twelve the measures
having disposed the sacrifice thoughtful sages send the car forward with the rc and saman
the chariots majesties are fourteen others seven sages lead it onward with their voices
who will declare to us the ford apnana the path whereby they drink first draughts of soma
the fifteen lauds are in a thousand places that is as vast as heaven and earth in measure
a thousand spots contain the mighty thousand vak spreadeth forth as far as prayer extendeth
what sage hath learned the metres application who hath gained vak the spirits aim and object
which ministering priest is called eighth hero who then hath tracked the two bay steeds of indra
yoked to his chariotpole there stood the coursers they only travel round earths farthest limits
these when their driver in his home is settled receive the allotted meed of their exertion
verily wondrous is the tender younglings growth who never draweth nigh to drink his mothers milk
as soon as she who hath no udder bore him he faring on his great errand suddenly grew strong
then agni was his name most active to bestow gathering up the trees with his consuming tooth
skilled in fair sacrifice armed with destroying tongue impetuous as a bull that snorteth in the mead
praise him yourgod who birdlike rests upon a tree scattering drops of juice and pouring forth his flood
speaking aloud with flame as with his lips a priest and broadening his paths like one of high command
thou everlasting whom farstriding fain to burn the winds uninterrupted never overcome
they have approached as warriors eager for the fight heroic trita guiding him to gain his wish
this agni is the best of kanvas kanvas friend conqueror of the foe whether afar or near
may agni guard the singers guard the princes well may agni grant to us our princes gracious help
do thou supitrya swiftly following make thyself the lord of jatavedas mightiest of all
who surely gives a boon even in thirsty land most powerful prepared to aid us in the wilds
thus noble agni with princes and mortal men is lauded excellent for conquering strength with chiefs
men who are welldisposed as friends and true to law even as the heavens in majesty surpass mankind
o son of strength victorious with this title upastutas most potent voice reveres thee
blest with brave sons by thee we will extol thee and lengthen out the days of our existence
thus agni have the sons of vrstihavya the rsis the upastutas invoked thee
protect them guard the singers and the princes with vasat have they come with hands uplifted with their uplifted hands and cries of glory
drink soma juice for mighty power and vigour drink strongest one that thou mayst smite down vrtra
drink thou invoked for strength and riches drink thou thy fill of meath and pour it down o indra
drink of the foodful juice stirred into motion drink what thou choosest of the flowing soma
giver of weal be joyful in thy spirit and turn thee hitherward to bless and prosper
let heavenly soma gladden thee o indra let that effused among mankind delight thee
rejoice in that whereby thou gavest freedom and that whereby thou conquerest thy foemen
let indra come impetuous doubly mighty to the poured juice the bull with two bay coursers
with juices pressed in milk with meath presented glut evermore thy bolt o foedestroyer
dash down outffaming their sharp flaming weapons the strongholds of the men urged on by demons
i give thee mighty one great strength and conquest go meet thy foes and rend them in the battle
extend afar the votarys fame and glory as the firm archers strength drives off the foeman
ranged on our side grown strong in might that conquers never defeated still increase thy body
to thee have we presented this oblation accept it sovran ruler free from anger
juice maghavan for thee is pressed and ripened eat indra drink of that which stirs to meet thee
eat indra these oblations which approach thee be pleased with food made ready and with soma
with entertainment we receive thee friendly effectual be the sacrificers wishes
i send sweet speech to indra and to agni with hymns i speed it like a boat through waters
even thus the gods seem moving round about me the fountains and bestowers of our riches
the gods have not ordained hunger to be our death even to the wellfed man comes death in varied shape
the riches of the liberal never waste away while he who will not give finds none to comfort him
the man with food in store who when the needy comes in miserable case begging for bread to eat
hardens his heart against himeven when of old he did him servicefinds not one to comfort him
bounteous is he who gives unto the beggar who comes to him in want of food and feeble
success attends him in the shout of battle he makes a friend of him in future troubles
no friend is he who to his friend and comrade who comes imploring food will offer nothing
let him departno home is that to rest in and rather seek a stranger to support him
let the rich satisfy the poor implorer and bend his eye upon a longer pathway
riches come now to one now to another and like the wheels of cars are ever rolling
the foolish man wins food with fruitless labour that food i speak the truth shall be his ruin
he feeds no trusty friend no man to love him all guilt is he who eats with no partaker
the ploughshare ploughing makes the food that feeds us and with its feet cuts through the path it follows
better the speaking than the silent brahman the liberal friend outyalues him who gives not
he with one foot hath far outrun the biped and the twofooted catches the threefooted
fourfooted creatures come when bipeds call them and stand and look where five are met together
the hands are both alike their labour differs the yield of sister milchkine is unequal
twins even diffier in their strength and vigour two even kinsmen differ in their bounty
agni refulgent among men thou slayest the devouring fiend
bright ruler in thine own abode
thou springest up when worshipped well the drops of butter are thy joy
when ladies are brought near to thee
honoured with gifts he shines afar agni adorable with song
the dripping ladle balms his face
agni with honey in his mouth honoured with gifts is balmed with oil
refulgent in his wealth of light

have i not drunk of soma juice
the heavens and earth themselves have not grown equal to one half of me
have i not drunk of soma juice
i in my grandeur have surpassed the heavens and all this spacious earth
have i not drunk of soma juice
aha this spacious earth will i deposit either here or there
have i not drunk of soma juice
in one short moment will i smite the earth in fury here or there
have i not drunk of soma juice
one of my flanks is in the sky i let the other trail below
have i not drunk of soma juice
greatest of the mighty ones am lifted to the firmament
have i not drunk of soma juice
i seek the worshippers abode oblationbearer to the gods
have i not drunk of soma juice

brhaddiva the foremost of lightwinners repeats these holy prayers this strength of indra
he rules the great selfluminous fold of cattle and all the doors of light hath he thrown open
thus hath brhaddiva the great atharvan spoken to indra as himself in person
the spotless sisters they who are his mothers with power exalt him and impel him onward
in the beginning rose hiranyagarbha born only lord of all created beings

see vena born in light hath driven hither on chariot of the air the calves of prsni
singers with hymns caress him as an infant there where the waters and the sunlight mingle
vena draws up his wave from out the ocean mistborn the fair ones back is made apparent
brightly he shone aloft on orders summit the hosts sang glory to their common birthplace
full many lowing to their jointpossession dwelling together stood the darlings mothers
ascending to the lofty height of order the bands of singers sip the sweets of amrta
knowing his form the sages yearned to meet him they have come nigh to hear the wild bulls bellow
performing sacrifice they reached the river for the gandharva found the immortal waters
the apsaras the lady sweetly smiling supports her lover in sublimest heaven
in his friends dwelling as a friend he wanders he vena rests him on his golden pinion
they gaze on thee with longing in their spirit as on a strongwinged bird that mounteth skyward
on thee with wings of gold varunas envoy the bird that hasteneth to the home of yama
erect to heaven hath the gandharva mounted pointing at us his manycoloured weapons
clad in sweet raiment beautiful to look on for he as light produceth forms that please us
when as a spark he cometh near the ocean still looking with a vultures eye to heaven
his lustre joying in its own bright splendour maketh dear glories in the lowest region
come to this sacrifice of ours o agni threefold with seven threads and five divisions
be our oblationbearer and preceder thou hast lain long enough in during darkness
i come a god foreseeing from the godless to immortality by secret pathways
while i ungracious one desert the gracious leave mine own friends and seek the kin of strangers
looking to the guest of other lineage have founded many a rule of law and order
i bid farewell to the great god the father and for neglect obtain my share of worship
i tarried many a year within this altar i leave the father for my choice is indra
away pass agni varuna and soma rule ever changes this i come to favour
these asuras have lost their powers of magic but thou o varuna if thou dost love me
o king discerning truth and right from falsehood come and be lord and ruler of my kingdom
here is the light of heaven here allis lovely here there is radiance here is airs wide region
let us two slaughter vrtra forth o soma thou art oblation we therewith will serve thee
the sage hath fixed his form by wisdom in the heavens varuna with no violence let the waters flow
like womenfolk the floods that bring prosperity have eau lit his hue and colour as they gleamed and shone
these wait upon his loftiest power and vigour he dwells in these who triumph in their godhead
and they like people who elect their ruler have in abhorrence turned away from vrtra
they call him swan the abhorrent floods companion moving in friendship with celestial waters
the poets in their thought have looked on indra swiftly approaching when anustup calls him
i travel with the rudras and the vasus with the adityas and allgods i wander
i hold aloft both varuna and mitra indra and agni and the pair of asvins
i cherish and sustain highswelling soma and tvastar i support pusan and bhaga
i load with wealth the zealous sdcrificer who pours the juice and offers his oblation
i am the queen the gathererup of treasures most thoughtful first of those who merit worship
thus gods have stablished me in many places with many homes to enter and abide in
through me alone all eat the food that feeds themeach man who sees brewhes hears the word outspoken
they know it not but yet they dwell beside me hear one and all the truth as i declare it
verily myself announce and utter the word that gods and men alike shall welcome
i make the man i love exceeding mighty make him a sage a rsi and a brahman
i bend the bow for rudra that his arrow may strike and slay the hater of devotion
i rouse and order battle for the people and i have penetrated earth and heaven
on the worlds summit i bring forth the father my home is in the waters in the ocean
thence i extend oer all existing creatures and touch even yonder heaven with my forehead

beyond this wide earth and beyond the heavens i have become so mighty in my grandeur
no peril no severe distress ye gods affects the mortal man
whom aryaman and mitra lead and varima of one accord beyond his foes
this very thing do we desire varuna mitra aryaman
whereby ye guhrd the mortal man from sore distress and lead him safe beyond his foes

these lead us safely over all varuna mitra aryaman
these who are kings of living men over all troubles far away beyond our foes
may they give bliss to aid us well varuna mitra aryaman
may the adityas when we pray grant us wide shelter and defence beyond our foes
as in this place o holy ones ye vasus freed even the gaud when her feet were fettered
so free us now from trouble and affliction and let our life be lengthened still o api
with all her eyes the goddess night looks forth approaching many a spot
she hath put all her glories on
immortal she hath filled the waste the goddess hath filled height and depth
she conquers darkness with her light
the goddess as she comes hath set the dawn her sister in her place
and then the darkness vanishes
so favour us this night o thou whose pathways we have visited
as birds their nest upon the tree
the villagers have sought their homes and all that walks and all that flies
even the falcons fain for prey
keep off the shewolf and the wolf o urmya keep the thief away
easy be thou for us to pass
clearly hath she come nigh to me who decks the dark with richest hues
o morning cancel it like debts
these have i brought to thee like kine o night thou child of heaven accept
this laud as for a conqueror
let me win glory agni in our battles enkindling thee may we support our bodies
may the four regions bend and bow before me with thee for guardian may we win in combat
may all the gods be on my side in battle the maruts led by indra visnu agni
mine be the middle airs extended region and may the wind blow favouring these my wishes
may the gods grant me riches may the blessing and invocation of the gods assist me
foremost in fight be the divine invokers may we unwounded have brave heroes round us
for me let them present all mine oblations and let my minds intention be accomplished
may i he guiltless of the least transgression and all ye gods do ye combine to bless us
ye six divine expanses grant us freedom here all ye gods acquit yourselves like heroes
let us not lose our children or our bodies let us not benefit the foe king soma
baffling the wrath of our opponents agni guard us as our infallible protector
let these thy foes turn back and seek their houses and let their thought who watch at home be ruined
lord of the world creator of creators the saviour god who overcomes the foeman
may gods brhaspati both asvins shelter from ill this sacrifice and sacrificer
foodful and muchinvoked at this our calling may the great bull vouchsafe us wide protection
lord of bay coursers indra blew our children harm us not give us not as prey to others
let those who are our foemen stay afar from us with indra and with agni we will drive them off
vasus adityas rudras have exalted me made me farreaching mighty thinker sovran lord
then was not nonexistent nor existent there was no realm of air no sky beyond it
what covered in and where and what gave shelter was water there unfathomed depth of water
death was not then nor was there aught immortal no sign was there the days and nights divider
that one thing breathless breathed by its own nature apart from it was nothing whatsoever
darkness there was at first concealed in darkness this all was indiscriminated chaos
all that existed then was void and form less by the great power of warmth was born that unit
thereafter rose desire in the beginning desire the primal seed and germ of spirit
sages who searched with their hearts thought discovered the existents kinship in the nonexistent
transversely was their severing line extended what was above it then and what below it
there were begetters there were mighty forces free action here and energy up yonder
who verily knows and who can here declare it whence it was born and whence comes this creation
the gods are later than this worlds production who knows then whence it first came into being
he the first origin of this creation whether he formed it all or did not form it
whose eye controls this world in highest heaven he verily knows it or perhaps he knows not
the sacrifice drawn out with threads on every side stretched by a hundred sacred ministers and one
this do these fathers weave who hitherward are come they sit beside the warp and cry weave forth weave back
the man extends it and the man unbinds it even to this vault of heaven hath he outspun it
these pegs are fastened to the seat of worship they made the samahymns their weaving shuttles
what were the rule the order and the model what were the wooden fender and the butter
what were the hymn the chant the recitation when to the god all deities paid worship
closely was gayatri conjoined with agni and closely savitar combined with usnih
brilliant with ukthas soma joined anustup brhaspatis voice by brhati was aided
viraj adhered to varuna and mitra here tristup day by day was indras portion
jagati entered all the gods together so by this knowledge men were raised to rsis
so by this knowledge men were raised to rsis when ancient sacrifice sprang up our fathers
with the minds eye i think that i behold them who first performed this sacrificial worship
they who were versed in ritual and metre in hymns and rules were the seven godlike rsis
viewing the path of those of old the sages have taken up the reins like chariotdrivers
drive all our enemies away o indra the western mighty conqueror and the eastern
hero drive off our northern foes and southern that we in thy wide shelter may be joyful
what then as men whose fields are full of barley reap the ripe corn removing it in order
so bring the food of those men bring it hither who went not to prepare the grass for worship
men come not with one horse at sacred seasons thus they obtain no honour in assemblies
sages desiring herds of kine and horses strengthen the mighty indra for his friendship
ye asvins lords of splendour drank full draughts of grateful soma juice
and aided indra in his work with namuci of asura birth
as parents aid a son both asvins indra aided thee with their wondrous powers and wisdom
when thou with might hadst drunk the draught that gladdens sarasvati o maghavan refreshed thee
indra is strong to save rich in assistance may he possessing all be kind and gracious
may he disperse our foes and give us safety and may we be the lords of hero vigou r
may we enjoy his favour his the holy may we enjoy his blessed loving kindness
may this rich indra as our good protector drive off and keep afar all those who hate us
may dyaus the lord of lauded wealth and earth stand by the man who offers sacrifice
and may the asvins both the gods strengthen the worshipper with bliss
as such we honour you mitra and varuna with hasty zeal most blest you who sustain the folk
so may we through your friendship for the worshipper subdue the fiends
and when we seek to win your love and friendship wewho have precious wealth in our possession
or when the worshipper augments his riches let not his treasures be shut up
that other asura too was born of heaven thou art o varuna the king of all men
the chariots lord was well content forbearing to anger death by sin so great
this sin hath sakaputa here committed heroes who fled to their dear friend he slayeth
when the steed bringeth down your grace and favour in bodies dear and worshipful
your mother aditi ye wise was purified with water even as earth is purified from heaven
show love and kindness here below wash her in rays of heavenly light
ye twain have seated you as lords of wealth as one who mounts a car to him who sits upon the pole upon the wood
these our disheartened tribes nrmedhas saved from woe sumedhas saved from woe
sing strength to indra that shall set his chariot in the foremost place
giver of room in closest fight slayer of foes in shock of war be thou our great encourager let the weak bowstrings break upon the bows of feeble enemies
thou didst destroy the dragon thou sentest the rivers down to earth
foeless o indra wast thou born thou tendest well each choicest thing therefore we draw us close to thee let the weak bowstrings break upon the bows of feeble enemies
destroyed be all malignities and all our enemys designs
thy bolt thou castest at the foe o indra who would srnite us dead thy liberal bounty gives us wealth
the robber people round about indra who watch and aim at us
trample them down beneath thy foot a conquering scatterer art thou
whoso assails us indra be the man a stranger or akin
bring down thyself his strength although it be as vast as are the heavens
close to thy friendship do we cling o indra and depend or thee
lead us beyond all pain and grief along the path of holy law
do thou bestow upon us her o indra who yields according to the singers longing
that the great cow may with exhaustless udder pouring a thousand streams give milk to feed us
as like the morning thou hast filled o indra both the earth and heaven
so as the mighty one great king of all the mighty world of men the goddess mother brought thee forth the blessed mother gave thee life
relax that mortals stubborn strength whose heart is bent on wickedness
trample him down beneath thy feet who watches for and aims at us the goddess mother brought thee forth the blessed mother gave thee life
shake down o slayer of the foe those great all splendid enemies
with all thy powers o sakra all thine helps o indra shake them down
as thou o satakratu thou o indrv shakest all things down
as wealth for him who sheds the juice with thine assistance thousandfold
around on every side like drops of sweat let lightningflashes fall
let all malevolence pass away from us like threads of darva grass
thou bearest in thine hand a lance like a long hook great counsellor
as with his foremost foot a goat draw down the branch o maghavan
never o gods do we offend nor are we ever obstinate we walk as holy texts command
closely we clasp and cling to you cling to your sides beneath your arms
in the tree clothed with goodly leaves where yama drinketh with the gods
the father master of the house tendeth with love our ancient sires
i looked reluctantly on him who cherishes those men of old
on him who treads that evil path and then i yearned for this again
thou mountest though thou dost not see o child the new and wheelless car
which thou hast fashioned mentally onepoled but turning every way
the car which thou hast made to roll hitherward from the sages child
this hath the saman followed close hence laid together on a ship
who was the father of the child who made the chariot roll away
who will this day declare to us how the funeral gift was made
when the funeral gift was placed straightway the point of flame appeared
a depth extended in the front a passage out was made behind
here is the seat where yama dwells that which is called the home of gods
here minstrels blow the flute for him here he is glorified with songs
he with the long loose locks supports agni and moisture heaven and earth
he is all sky to look upon he with long hair is called this light
the munis girdled with the wind wear garments soiled of yellow hue
they following the winds swift course go where the gods have gone before
transported with our munihood we have pressed on into the winds
you therefore mortal men behold our natural bodies and no more
the muni made associate in the holy work of every god
looking upon all varied forms flies through the region of the air
the steed of vata vayus friend the muni by the gods impelled
in both the oceans hath his home in eastern and in western sea
treading the path of sylvan beasts gandharvas and apsarases
he with long locks who knows the wish is a sweet most delightful friend
vayu hath churned for him for him he poundeth things most hard to bend
when he with long loose locks hath drunk with rudra water from the cup
ye gods raise up once more the man whom ye have humbled and brought low
o gods restore to life again the man who hatb committed sin
two several winds are blowing here from sindhu from a distant land
may one breathe energy to thee the other blow disease away
hither o wind blow healing balm blow all disease away thou wind
for thou who hast all medicine comest as envoy of the gods
i am come nigh to thee with balms to give thee rest and keep thee safe
i bring thee blessed strength i drive thy weakening malady away
here let the gods deliver him the maruts band deliver him
all things that be deliver him that he be freed from his disease
the waters have their healing power the waters drive disease away
the waters have a balm for all let them make medicine for thee
the tongue that leads the voice precedes then with our tenfold branching hands
with these two chasers of disease we stroke thee with a gentle touch
allied with thee in friendship indra these thy priests remembering holy law rent vrtra limb from limb
when they bestowed the dawns and let the waters flow and when thou didst chastise dragons at kutsas call
thou sentest forth productive powers clavest the hills thou dravest forth the kine thou drankest pleasant meath
thou gavest increase through this trees surpassing might the sun shone by the hymn that sprang from holy law
in the midway of heaven the sun unyoked his car the arya found a match to meet his dam foe
associate with rjisvan indra overthrew the solid forts of pipru conjuring asura
he boldly cast down forts which none had eer assailed unwearied he destroycd the godless treasurestores
like sun and moon he took the strongholds wealth away and praised in song demolished foes with flashing dart
armed with resistless weapons with vast power to cleave the vrtraslayer whets his darts and deals fordi wounds
bright usas was afraid of indras slaughtering bolt she went upon her way and left her chariot there
these are thy famous exploits only thine when thou alone hast left the other reft of sacrifice
thou in the heavens hast set the ordering of the moons the father bears the felly portioned out by thee
savitar goldenhaired hath lifted eastward bright with the sunbeams his eternal lustre
he in whose energy wise pusan marches surveying all existence like a herdsman
beholding men he sits amid the heaven filling the two worldhalves and airs wide region
he looks upon the rich farspreading pastures between the eastern and the western limit
he root of wealth the gathererup of treasures looks with his might on every form and figure
savitar like a godwhose law is constant stands in the battle for the spoil like indra
waters from sacrifice came to the gandharva visvavasu o soma when they saw him
indra approaching quickly marked their going and looked around upon the suns enclosures
this song visvavasu shall sing us meter of airs midrealm celestial gandharva
that we may know aright both truth and falsehood may he inspire our thoughts and help our praises
in the floods track he found the bootyseeker the rocky cowpens doors he threw wide open
these the gandharva told him rowed with amrta indra knew well the puissancc of the dragons
agni lifepower and fame are thine thy fires blaze mightily thou rich in wealth of beams
sage passing bright thou givest to the worshipper with strength the food that merits laud
with brilliant purifying sheen with perfect sheen thou liftest up thyself in light
thou visiting both thy mothers aidest them as son thou joinest close the earth and heaven
o jatavedas son of strength rejoice ihyself gracious in our fair hymns and songs

let aryarnan vouchsafe us wealth and bhaga and brhaspati
let the gods give their gifts and let sunrta goddess grant us wealth
we call king soma to our aid and agni with our songs and hymns
adityas visnu surya and the brahman priest brhaspati
indra vayu brhaspati gods swift to listen we invoke
that in the synod all the folk may be benevolent to us
urge aryaman to send us gifts and indra and brhaspati
vata visnu sarasvati and the strong courser savitar
do thou o agni with thy fires strengthen our prayer and sacrifice
urge givers to bestow their wealth to aid our service of the gods
with thee o agni was this singer of the laud he hath no other kinship o thou son of strength
thou givest blessed shelter with a triple guard keep the destructive lightning far away from us
thy birth who seekest food is in the falling flood agni as comrade thou winnest all living things
our coursers and our songs shall be victorious they of themselves advance like one who guards the herd
and thou o agni thou of godlike nature sparest the stones while caring up the brushwood
then are thy tracks like deserts in the cornlands let us not stir to wrath thy mighty arrow
oer hills through vales devouring as thou goest thou partest like an army fain for booty
as when a barber shaves a beard thou shavest earth when the wind blows on thy flame and fans it
apparent are his lines as he approaches the course is single but the cars are many
when agni thou making thine arms resplendent advancest oer the land spread out beneath thee
now let thy strength thy burning flames fly upward thine energies o agni as thou toilest
gape widely bend thee waxing in thy vigour let all the vasus sit this day beside thee
this is the waters reservoir the great abode of gathered streams
take thou another path than this and as thou listest walk thereon
on thy way hitherward and hence let flowery durva grass spring up
let there be lakes with lotus blooms these are the mansions of the flood
ye made that atri worn with eld free as a horse to win the goal
when ye restored to youth and strength kaksivan like a car renewed
ye freed that atri like a horse and brought him newlyborn to earth
ye loosed him like a firmtied knot which gods unsoiled by dust had bound
heroes who showed most wondrous power to atri strive to win fair songs
for then o heroes of the sky your hymn of praise shall cease no more
this claims your notice bounteous gods oblation asvins and our love
that ye o heroes in the fight may bring us safe to ample room
ye twain to bhujyu tossed about in ocean at the regions end
nasatyas with your winged sterds came nigh and gave him strength to win
come with your joys most liberal gods lords of all treasures bringing weal
like fresh full waters to a well so heroes come and be with us
this deathless indu like a steed strong and of full vitality
belongs to thee the orderer
here by us for the worshipper is the wise bolt that works with skill
it brings the bubbling beverage as a dexterous man brings the effectual strong drink
impetuous ahisuva a bull among cows of his
looked down upon the restless hawk
that the strongpinioned bird hath brought child of the falcon from afar
what moves upon a hundred wheels along the female dragons path
which fair unrobbed the falcon brought thee in his foot the redhued dwelling of the juice
through this came vital power which lengthens out our days and kinship through its help awoke
so indra is by lndus power een among gods will it repel great treachery
wisdom most sapient one brings force that lengthens life may wisdom bring the juice to us
from out the earth i dig this plant a herb of most effectual power
wherewith one quells the rival wife and gains the husband for oneself
auspicious with expanded leaves sent by the gods victorious plant
blow thou the rival wife away and make my husband only mine
stronger am o stronger one yea mightier than the mightier
and she who is my rival wife is lower than the lowest dames
her very name i utter not she takes no pleasure in this man
far into distance most remote drive we the rival wife away
i am the conqueror and thou thou also act victorious
as victory attends us both we will subdue my fellowwife
i have gained thee for vanquisher have grasped thee with a stronger spell
as a cow hastens to her calf so let thy spirit speed te me hasten like water on its way
goddess of wild and forest who seemest to vanish from the sight
how is it that thou seekest not the village art thou not afraid
what time the grasshopper replies and swells the shrill cicalas voice
seeming to sound with tinkling bells the lady of the wood exults
and yonder cattle seem to graze what seems a dwellingplace appears
or else at eve the lady of the forest seems to free the wains
here one is calling to his cow another there hath felled a tree
at eve the dweller in the wood fancies that somebody hath screamed
the goddess never slays unless some murderous enemy approach
man eats of savoury fruit and then takes even as he wills his rest
now have i praised the forest queen sweetscented redolent of balm
the mother of all sylvan things who tills not but hath stores of food
i trust in thy first wrathful deed o indra when thou slewest vrtra and didst work to profit man
what time the two worldhalves fell short of thee in might and the earth trembled at thy force o thunderanned
thou with thy magic powers didst rend the conjurer vrtra o blameless one with heart that longed for fame
heroes elect thee when they battle for the prey thee in all sacrifices worthy of renown
god muchinvoked take pleasure in these princes here who thine exalters maghavan have come to wealth
in synods when the rite succeeds they hymn the strong for sons and progeny and riches undisturbed
that man shall find delight in wellprotected wealth whose care provides for him the quicksought joyous draught

magician thou our varuna and mitra deal food to us o wondrous as dispenser
when we have pressed the juice we laud thee indra and when most valorous we have won the booty
bring us prosperity as each desires it under thine own protection may we conquer
sublime from birth mayst thou o indra hero with surya overcome the dasa races
as by a fountains side we bring the soma that lay concealed closehidden in the waters
answer the votarys hymns for these thou knowest craving the rsis prayer thyself a singer
may we be they who take delight in somas these with sweet food for thee o chariotrider
these holy prayers o indra have i sung thee grant to the men the strength of men thou hero

thence sprang the world from that uprose the region thence heaven spread out and the wide earth expanded

yon log that floats without a man to guide it on the rivers edge
seize it thou thing with hideous jaws and go thou far away thereon
when foul with secret stain and spot ye hastened onward to the breast
all indras enemies were slain and passed away like froth and foam
these men have led about the cow have duly carried agni round
and raised their glory tg the gods who will attack them with success
let songs of ours speed agni forth like a fleet courser in the race

with the adityas with the band of maruts may indra be protector of our bodies
as when the gods came after they had slaughtered the asuras keeping safe their godlike nature
brought the sun hitherward with mighty powers and looked about them on their vigorous godhead
may surya guard us out of heaven and vata from the firmament
and agni from terrestrial spots
thou savitar whose flame deserves hundred libations be thou pleased
from failing lightning keep us safe

oblation that which indra gave and thus grew glorious and most high
this have i offered o ye gods and rid me of each rival wife
destroyer of the rival wife sole spouse victorious conqueror

let not those other sacrificers stay thee indra these juices shed for thee are ready
thine is the juice effused thine are the juices yet to be pressed our resonant songs invite thee
o indra pleased today with this libation come thou who knowest all and drink the soma
whoso devoted to the god effuses soma for him with yearning heart and spirit
never doth indra give away his cattle for him he makes the lovely soma famous
he looks with ioving favour on the mortal who like a rich man pours for him the soma
maghavan in his bended arm supports him he slays unasked the men who hate devotion
we call on thee to come to us desirous of goods and spoil of cattle and of horses
for thy new love and favour are we present let us invoke thee indra as our welfare
for life i set thee free by this oblation from the unknown decline and from consumption

look on destruction far from hence the live mans mind is manifold
a happy boon do men elect a mighty blessing they obtain
bliss with vaivasvata they see the live mans mind seeks many a place
if by address by blame by imprecation we have committed sin awake or sleeping
all hateful acts of ours all evil doings may agni bear away to distant places
when indra brahmanaspati our deeds are wrongful and unjust
may provident angirasa prevent our foes from troubling us
we have prevailed this day and won we are made free from sin and guilt
ill thoughts that visit us awake or sleeping seize the man we hate yea seize the man who hateth us
gods whatsoeer the dove came hither seeking sent to us as the envoy of destruction
for that let us sing hymns and make atonement well be it with our quadrupeds and bipeds
auspicious be the dove that hath been sent us a harmless bird ye gods within our dwelling
may agni sage be pleased with our oblation and may the missile borne on wings avoid us
let not the arrow that hath wings distract us beside the fireplace on the hearth it settles
may it bring welfare to our men and cattle here let the dove ye gods forbear to harm us
the screeching of the owl is ineffective and when beside the fire the dove hath settled
to him who sent it hither as an envoy to him be reverence paid to death to yama
drive forth the dove chase it with holy verses rejoicing bring ye hither food and cattle
barring the way against all grief and trouble let the swift bird fly forth and leave us vigour

when with the prize i came unto the flowing juice o visvamitra jamadagni to your home

travelling on the paths of airs midregion no single day doth he take rest or slumber
holy and earliestborn friend of the waters where did he spring and from what region came he
